**I. CAPTION**
AURELIA ABO, ET AL. v. PHILAME (KG) EMPLOYEES & WORKERS UNION, PHILIPPINE TRANSPORT & GENERAL WORKERS ORGANIZATION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19912, January 30, 1965, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs-appellants, employees of Philippine American Embroideries, Inc., filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against the defendant-appellee Unions and their officers [1, 2]. The complaint alleged that from March 24 to May 6, 1961, the defendants used force, violence, and intimidation to prevent the plaintiffs from entering the company premises, causing them lost wages and damages [2, 3]. The complaint did not allege that these acts were connected to a labor dispute [4].

Instead of answering, the defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the acts constituted an unfair labor practice (ULP) involved in a pending case before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the acts fell under Section 4(b)(1) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) regarding union coercion, thus placing the matter within the CIR's jurisdiction [5]. Plaintiffs appealed, contending the court erred by considering evidence outside the complaint [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the action for damages against the labor union.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal, holding that the jurisdiction of a court is determined solely by the allegations of the complaint and not by the evidence or defenses raised by the other party [4, 7].

The Court found that the plaintiffs' complaint simply alleged acts of violence and a violation of their right to work, without stating that such acts were committed in connection with a labor dispute [4]. The Lower Court erred by relying on the defendants' evidence regarding the existence of a labor dispute to decline jurisdiction [4]. The Court cited *Campos Rueda Corp. v. Bautista*, reiterating that a motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction must rely on the complaint's recitals [4]. Furthermore, Section 24 of the Industrial Peace Act, which limits suits against unions for acts done "in furtherance of an industrial dispute," could not be invoked because the complaint did not establish that the acts were performed in such a context [8, 9].

The decision of the lower court was **REVERSED** and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [9].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar, JJ., concurred) [10].
