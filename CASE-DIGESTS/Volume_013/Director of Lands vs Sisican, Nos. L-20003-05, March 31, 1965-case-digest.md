I. CAPTION
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. GAVINO SISICAN, PELAGIO DAULONG, and UBALDO BULARON, G.R. Nos. L-20003-05, March 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Sisican, Daulong, and Bularon filed homestead applications for parcels of land in Misamis Occidental on various dates between 1945 and 1947 [1]. Before patents could be issued, Felisa Pipania filed Civil Case No. 655 in 1947, claiming ownership over a tract of land that included the areas applied for by respondents [1]. The Director of Lands intervened in that case, arguing the land was public domain, but the trial court rendered a final judgment in 1948 declaring the land private property of Pipania [1].

Despite this final judgment, the Director of Lands mistakenly issued homestead patents to the respondents in 1953 [2]. Upon discovering the error, the Director filed petitions to cancel the patents and titles, arguing the land was already private property [2]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental ruled in favor of the Director, declaring the patents null and void [3, 4]. Respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court, contending that the cancellation violated their right to due process because they were not impleaded as parties in Civil Case No. 655 [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cancellation of the respondents' homestead patents violates due process on the ground that they were not parties to the civil case which declared the land private.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the respondents' rights to the land were derived solely from the government as applicants for homestead patents [5]. Since the government, represented by the Director of Lands, was a party to Civil Case No. 655 and was bound by the decision declaring the land private, the respondents are equally bound by that judgment [5]. They cannot claim to be excluded from its effects.

The Court emphasized that when the patents were issued in 1953, the land had already been decreed as private property in 1948 and was no longer disposable public domain [5, 6]. Consequently, the applicants acquired no right or title to the land, and the Director of Lands correctly sought the cancellation of the erroneously issued patents [5].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [7].
