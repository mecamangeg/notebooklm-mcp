I. CAPTION
HOMOBONO H. GONZALES v. FELIPE JIMENEZ, SR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19073, January 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1930, Homobono Gonzales purchased a parcel of land in Naga, Camarines Sur from Felipe Jimenez, Sr., who executed a deed of sale and delivered possession. However, in 1953, Jimenez, Sr. fraudulently obtained a Free Patent and Original Certificate of Title (No. 11) in the name of his son, Jimenez, Jr. Gonzales only discovered the fraud in October 1956 when Jimenez, Sr. fenced the property. On July 26, 1957, Gonzales filed a complaint for reconveyance [1].

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the action was based on fraud and barred by prescription, as more than four years had elapsed since the issuance of the title in March 1953. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur dismissed the complaint, ruling that the four-year prescriptive period began from the date of registration, which serves as notice to the world [2, 3]. Gonzales appealed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case. The Court held that the case is governed by **Article 1456 of the Civil Code**, which provides that a person who acquires property through mistake or fraud is considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the prejudiced party [4].

Since the defendants obtained the title through fraudulent representations, they are deemed to hold the land in trust for the plaintiff. The Court, citing *Alzona v. Capunitan*, ruled that an action for reconveyance based on an implied or constructive trust prescribes in **ten (10) years**, not four [4, 5]. As the title was issued in 1953 and the complaint filed in 1957, the ten-year period had not yet elapsed [4].

The order appealed from was set aside and the case was remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings [5].
