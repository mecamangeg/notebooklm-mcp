I. CAPTION
COTABATO TIMBERLAND CO., INC. v. PLARIDEL LUMBER CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19432, February 26, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cotabato Timberland and Respondent Plaridel Lumber held adjacent forest concessions in Cotabato. Petitioner filed a complaint alleging two encroachments by Respondent. First, in 1958, Petitioner claimed Respondent logged within its boundary. A resurvey by Forester Tobias supported this, but Tobias relied on courses and distances while ignoring existing concrete monuments. Second, in November 1959, Respondent constructed a road traversing Petitioner’s Parcel II without notice, cutting approximately 600,000 board feet of timber. Respondent later obtained a right-of-way permit from the Director of Forestry in 1960, which was conditioned on turning over the cut trees to Petitioner. Instead of delivering the logs, Respondent exported them to Japan.

The Court of First Instance of Cotabato dismissed the complaint. It rejected the first cause of action because the Tobias survey was inaccurate. It dismissed the second cause of action, reasoning that Petitioner was not "ready to receive" the logs due to a lack of roads. Petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the resurvey by Forester Tobias sufficiently proved the first encroachment (1958).
2. W/N Petitioner was required to exhaust administrative remedies regarding the second encroachment (1959-1960).
3. W/N Respondent is liable for damages for the logs cut during the road construction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the survey was unreliable because Tobias failed to locate the concrete monuments (Pls) indicated on the control map and relied only on courses and distances. It is an established rule that in boundaries, "monuments control courses and distances as well as the calculated area" (*Gov’t. of P.I. vs. Abad*). Since the survey was disapproved by the Bureau of Forestry and contradicted established monuments, it could not support the claim for the 1958 damages.

2. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when it would be futile. The Director of Forestry had already authorized the release of the logs to Respondent on a meager bond of P7,200.00. Respondent immediately exported the logs to Japan, removing them from the jurisdiction and rendering any further administrative appeal meaningless.

3. **YES.** Respondent’s intrusion was illegal, as the permit was obtained after the entry and was conditioned on turning over the logs to Petitioner. Under Section 1837 of the Revised Administrative Code, forest products unlawfully cut in another's licensed territory belong to the licensee. Petitioner’s lack of a road was no excuse for Respondent’s failure to deliver or notify. The Court found Respondent acted with "rebellious disregard of administrative authority," justifying P61,399.66 in compensatory damages, P10,000.00 in exemplary damages (Civil Code, Art. 2233), and P5,000.00 in attorney's fees (Civil Code, Art. 2208).

Decision reversed.
