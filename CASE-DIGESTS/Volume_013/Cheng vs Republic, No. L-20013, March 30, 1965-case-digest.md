I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Dalmacio Cheng alias Benito Lim to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines, Dalmacio Cheng alias Benito Lim v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-20013, March 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dalmacio Cheng, alias Benito Lim, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, declaring his residence at No. 634 Caballeros Street, Binondo. The CFI granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, raising for the first time that the petitioner failed to state his previous residence at No. 755 Sto. Cristo, San Nicolas, Manila, and that he used the alias "Benito Lim" without judicial authorization. The petitioner argued that the State could not raise new issues on appeal. He further claimed the omitted address was in the same district and that "Benito Lim" was merely his baptismal name [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the State can raise questions on appeal that were not presented in the lower court in naturalization cases.
2. W/N the failure to state a previous residence is fatal to the petition.
3. W/N the petitioner’s use of an alias was unauthorized and fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A petition for naturalization is of a special nature necessarily involving public interest. In case of appeal, the entire record is open for scrutiny regardless of whether an objection was submitted in the lower court [2, 3]. The State may even object to a petitioner’s qualifications during the oath-taking [3].

2. **YES.** The failure to state all places of residence in the application violates Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Com. Act No. 473) and is fatal to the petition [4]. This requirement is designed to facilitate the checking of the petitioner's activities. The fact that the omitted address was in close proximity (same district) to the declared residence is not a valid excuse for the omission [4].

3. **YES.** The petitioner’s documents showed significant discrepancies. His birth certificate and alien registration used "Dalmacio Tan Chung" or "Dalmacio Cheng," while his school records and baptismal certificate used "Benito Lim" [5]. The claim that "Benito Lim" was a baptismal name was refuted by evidence that he was enrolled in school under that name in 1941, nine years before he was baptized in 1952 [5]. Additionally, there were discrepancies in his parents' names and his birth date across documents. This constituted either an unauthorized use of an alias in violation of the Anti-Alias Law (Com. Act No. 142) or proof that the names did not refer to the same person; either alternative is fatal to the application [6].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision appealed from is REVERSED, and the petition for naturalization is DENIED [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
