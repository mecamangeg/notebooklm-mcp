I. CAPTION
DOMINGO BAUTISTA v. JOSE MA. BARREDO and STATE BONDING AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-20653, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Domingo Bautista obtained a judgment in Civil Case No. 1636 against Philippine Ready Mix Concrete Company, Inc. for P100,000.00 [1]. To satisfy the unpaid balance, a writ of garnishment was served on Respondent Jose Ma. Barredo, a sublessee of a crane belonging to the company, ordering him to pay rentals to the Sheriff [1]. Barredo paid partially but stopped based on an alleged agreement with Bautista [2].

Consequently, the trial court issued an order declaring Barredo in contempt unless he paid P6,600.00 in accrued rentals [2]. Barredo appealed this order to the Court of Appeals (CA) and filed a supersedeas bond subscribed by Respondent State Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. to stay execution [3]. The CA ruled in favor of Barredo, setting aside the contempt order but reserving Bautista's right to enforce the indebtedness in a separate action [3]. Bautista then filed the present complaint against Barredo (on the garnishment liability) and the surety (on the bond) [3]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, ruling that Barredo was not a party to the original case and that the surety was not liable because Barredo won the appeal [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a separate action can be maintained against the garnishee (Barredo) regarding his liability under the writ of garnishment even if he was not a party to the original case.
2. W/N the surety (State Bonding) is liable under the supersedeas bond.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that while a garnishee is not a party to the case instituted by the creditor against the debtor, jurisdiction is acquired over him by the court and he becomes a "virtual party" to the case when the sheriff serves the writ of garnishment [6]. Citing *Tayabas Land Company v. Sharruf*, the Court explained that a garnishee becomes a "forced intervenor," and the court requires him to pay his debt to the new creditor (the judgment creditor) [6]. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint against Barredo on the procedural ground that he was not a party to the original judgment [7].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal regarding the surety. The bond contract expressly stated that it would be null and void if the appeal was decided in favor of Barredo [5]. Since the Court of Appeals decided the appeal in Barredo's favor, the condition for the bond's liability (that the appeal be decided *against* him) was not fulfilled [8].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED insofar as State Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. is concerned, and REVERSED as to Jose Ma. Barredo. The case is remanded to the court *a quo* for decision on the merits regarding Barredo [8].
