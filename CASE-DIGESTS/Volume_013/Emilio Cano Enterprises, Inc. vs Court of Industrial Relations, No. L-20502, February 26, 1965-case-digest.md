I. CAPTION
EMILIO CANO ENTERPRISES, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20502, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 6, 1956, a complaint for unfair labor practice was filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against Emilio and Rodolfo Cano in their capacities as President and Manager, respectively, of Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. [1]. The CIR found them guilty and ordered them, jointly and severally, to reinstate Honorata Cruz to her former position with backwages [2]. The decision was affirmed by the CIR *en banc* [2].

On August 23, 1961, a writ of execution was issued directing the levy against the properties of Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. [2]. The corporation filed a motion to quash the writ, arguing that the judgment was rendered against its officials (Emilio and Rodolfo), not the corporation, which possesses a juridical personality separate and distinct from its members [3]. The CIR denied the motion, prompting the corporation to file a petition for certiorari [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment rendered against the corporate officers in their official capacities can be enforced against the property of the corporation which was not a party to the case. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while a corporation generally has a personality separate from its members, this legal fiction cannot be invoked when used as a shield to further an end subversive of justice [4].

The Court found that Emilio Cano Enterprises, Inc. is a closed family corporation where the incorporators and directors belong to a single family [4]. In this instance, the corporation and its members can be considered as one [4]. Citing *La Campana Coffee Factory v. Kaisahan ng mga Manggagawa* and *McConnel v. Court of Appeals*, the Court ruled that the corporate entity may be disregarded when invoked to defeat public policy or justice [4].

Furthermore, Emilio and Rodolfo Cano were sued in their official capacities as President and Manager [5]. Their connection to the case was impressed with the representation of the corporation, and the order to reinstate the employee to her position in the corporation was effectively an order against the corporation itself [5]. To require a technical substitution of parties would only cause unwarranted delay and prejudice the employee, contrary to the spirit of labor laws [5].

The petition is dismissed [6].
