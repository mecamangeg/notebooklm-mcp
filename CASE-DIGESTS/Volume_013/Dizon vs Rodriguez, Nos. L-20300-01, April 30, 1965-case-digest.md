I. CAPTION
ANTONINO DIZON, ET AL. v. HON. JUAN DE G. RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. / REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-20300-01 & L-20355-56, April 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Hacienda Calatagan owners (Zobels) originally held TCT No. T-722. In 1938, they constructed a pier ("Santiago Landing") extending 600 meters into Pagaspas Bay [1]. In 1948, they converted the pier into a dike and enclosed portions of the bay to create fishponds, identified as Lot 1 (30 hectares) and Lot 49 (37 hectares) [1]. A subdivision plan was approved in 1949, and TCTs were issued for these lots. Lot 49 was sold to petitioners Dizon, et al., and Lot 1 to Goco and Sy-Juco, who obtained their own Torrens titles [2].

In 1952, respondents Tolentinos filed applications for fishpond permits covering these lots [3]. Petitioners protested, but the Director of Fisheries dismissed the protest, finding the lots were outside the original Hacienda boundaries and were foreshore lands [3]. Petitioners filed actions to quiet title. The Republic intervened, claiming the land was public domain. The CFI ruled the lots were foreshore lands and cancelled petitioners' titles but declared them possessors in good faith [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding petitioners were entitled to retention until reimbursed for necessary expenses [5]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the subject lots are part of the public domain (foreshore land) rendering the titles void.
2. W/N the petitioners are possessors in good faith entitled to reimbursement and retention.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The lots are part of the foreshore/territorial waters and belong to the State. Evidence showed the pier jutted into the sea and the fishponds were created by enclosing part of the bay [6]. The subdivision plan was found to have been prepared in disregard of the technical descriptions in the original title [7]. The Court applied the principle that the incontestable and indefeasible character of a Torrens certificate of title does not operate when the land covered is not capable of registration, such as foreshore land [7].

2. **YES.** Petitioners are possessors in good faith. A possessor with a Torrens Title who is unaware of any flaw in their title is considered in good faith. This character is not lost until the title is declared null and void by a final judgment of the Courts [8]. Furthermore, under Article 526 of the Civil Code, a mistake upon a doubtful or difficult question of law may be the basis of good faith [9]. Consequently, petitioners are entitled to retain the properties until the Republic reimburses them for the necessary expenses [5].

**Decision affirmed.**
