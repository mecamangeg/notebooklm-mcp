I. CAPTION
ANDREA R. VDA. DE AGUINALDO v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19927, February 26, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Leopoldo Aguinaldo and his wife received P10,000.00 in cash dividends in 1952 but declared P5,000.00 of it in their 1953 income tax return. They paid the tax for 1953 on August 14, 1954 [1]. In August 1955, BIR agents readjusted the returns, shifting the income to 1952, which resulted in a deficiency for 1952 and an overpayment of P1,600.00 for 1953 [2]. The examiner recommended crediting the overpayment against the deficiency, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed the 1952 deficiency on October 28, 1957, without applying the credit [2]. On January 10, 1958, Aguinaldo's counsel formally requested the credit [3]. The CIR denied the request, stating the claim was filed beyond the two-year period under Section 309 of the National Internal Revenue Code [3]. After Leopoldo's death, his wife Andrea appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, which dismissed the case for lack of cause of action [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is entitled to the tax credit for the 1953 overpayment despite filing the claim more than two years after payment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is not entitled to the credit. Section 309 of the National Internal Revenue Code explicitly states that the authority of the Commissioner to credit or refund taxes "can only be exercised if the claim for credit or refund is made in writing and filed with him within two years after the payment of the tax" [5]. The Court emphasized that this requirement is a mandatory condition precedent [6]. Since the tax was paid on August 14, 1954, and the claim was not filed until January 1958, the two-year prescriptive period had already lapsed, precluding the Commissioner from granting the relief [6].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Makalintal, J. reserved his vote [7].
