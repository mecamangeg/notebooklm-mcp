I. CAPTION
RAMON GONZAGA, NATIVIDAD GARCIA, ET AL. v. TERTULINO BICO and MANUEL H. JAVELONA, G.R. No. L-20291, February 27, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On January 14, 1962, barrio elections were held in Barrio Lag-asan, Bago, Negros Occidental, where Cesar Alvarez was proclaimed elected barrio lieutenant [1]. On January 18, 1962, respondent Tertulino Bico filed an election protest before the Justice of the Peace of Bago against petitioners Ramon Gonzaga and others, but failed to include Alvarez or allege that Bico was voted for in the election [1]. During the hearing on March 7, 1962, petitioners moved to dismiss, but the Justice of the Peace admitted Bico's amended protest which included Alvarez, despite more than two weeks having elapsed since the proclamation [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental, arguing the amended protest was filed outside the reglementary period under Sec. 174 of the Revised Election Code [1, 2]. The CFI dismissed the petition for certiorari, prompting petitioners to appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the election contest has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found that the question of whether the officials proclaimed on January 14, 1962 were legally elected had become moot [4]. Under Republic Act No. 2370, otherwise known as the Barrio Charter, the term of office for the barrio lieutenant and members of the barrio council is only two years [4, 5]. Since the term of the officials elected in 1962 had already expired by the time of the decision, and new elections were held on January 12, 1964, the case was deemed academic [4].

Case dismissed [6].
