**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AGRECIO LUMAYAG, G.R. No. L-19142, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On the evening of April 12, 1959, in Lanao del Norte, spouses Pedro Lumayag and Luzviminda Pampilo heard a shout for help from Pedro’s father-in-law, Jose Pampilo [1]. Upon rushing to the scene, they saw the accused, Agrecio Lumayag, straddling Jose and strangling him [1]. Agrecio fled but was later arrested and confessed to killing Jose with a cane called "bahi" [2, 3]. The trial court convicted Agrecio of Murder, appreciating the qualifying circumstances of treachery and nocturnity, while considering the mitigating circumstance of "vindication of a wrong" based on a boxing incident between the two nine months prior [4]. Agrecio appealed, relying on the defense of alibi, claiming he was in another town receiving treatment from a quack doctor [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the defense of alibi prevails over the positive identification by the witnesses.
2. W/N the crime committed is Murder (specifically W/N treachery and nocturnity were proven).
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of vindication of a wrong applies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prevail in the face of the positive testimonies of prosecution witnesses who definitely identified the accused [6]. The Court found the alibi improbable and the testimony of the quack doctor unreliable [6].

2. **NO.** The crime is **Homicide**. The Court held that while the killing was established, there was no evidence that Agrecio acted with treachery or evident premeditation, or that he specially sought the advantage of nighttime to facilitate the crime [7]. Citing *U.S. v. Bañagale*, the Court ruled that when the details and circumstances surrounding the commencement of the attack are unknown, the crime must be classified as homicide, not murder [7].

3. **NO.** The boxing incident where the deceased injured the accused occurred on July 8, 1958, approximately nine months before the killing [8]. The Court ruled that the mitigating circumstance of vindication of a wrong cannot be considered when a significant length of time has intervened between the offense charged and the wrong claimed to be vindicated [8, 9].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, finding the accused guilty of Homicide [10].
