I. CAPTION
RAFAEL L. DIZON v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23449, January 30, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 12, 1964, Ismael Mathay retired as Auditor of the Central Bank [1]. Iluminado Medrano, a Senior Assistant Auditor, sought the position but was not appointed [2, 3]. Instead, Hilarion Beronilla was designated as Acting Auditor, and upon Beronilla's sick leave, Medrano was designated Acting Auditor temporarily [3].

On July 10, 1964, petitioner Rafael L. Dizon was appointed Auditor of the Central Bank, with approval from the Civil Service Commission [4]. On August 21, 1964, the Auditor General revoked Medrano's designation as Acting Auditor and ordered Dizon to assume office, which he did on August 24, 1964 [4, 5].

On August 27, 1964, Medrano filed a *quo warranto* suit in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (presided by respondent Judge Yatco) against Dizon, claiming Dizon's appointment was void and that Medrano was entitled to the office [6]. Medrano prayed for an *ex parte* preliminary prohibitory injunction to enjoin Dizon from acting as Auditor [6]. Judge Yatco granted the injunction *ex parte* on August 31, 1964 [7]. Dizon filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, alleging grave abuse of discretion [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction *ex parte*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the order.

The Court held that the issuance of the writ *ex parte* constituted grave abuse of discretion because Medrano failed to show a clear and positive right to be protected, which is a prerequisite for the granting of an injunction [8]. At the time of the suit, Dizon was already the duly appointed Auditor discharging the functions of the office, while Medrano was merely a senior assistant whose acting designation had been revoked [9].

The Court established that before a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued—especially one that disturbs the holding of a public office—the merits of the case must be considered or the parties given an opportunity to present evidence to determine if the applicant has an existing right [9, 10]. Since Dizon was the incumbent with an apparently valid appointment, he was entitled to continue holding office until proven otherwise in a trial on the merits [9]. The Court cited *Dunnom v. Thomsen*, emphasizing that equity will not enforce a mere abstract right without proof of actual injury to a clear right [8, 11].

The order of the respondent judge dated August 31, 1964, granting the writ *ex parte*, is set aside, and the lower court is directed to try and decide the *quo warranto* case on the merits [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J.B.L. Reyes, J., concurred in the result [13].
