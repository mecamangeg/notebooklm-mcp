I. CAPTION
RODOLFO CARREON, ALFREDO ABAD, NICOLAS CARREON and SEDRONIO CALALANG v. GERMANICO CARREON, HERMINIO ACAYLAR, JUSTINO SALDON and BENJAMIN CARDINO, G.R. No. L-22176, April 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rodolfo Carreon and his co-petitioners were elected Municipal Mayor and Councilors, respectively, of Dapitan in the 1959 general elections, with terms expiring on December 31, 1963 [1]. On June 22, 1963, Republic Act No. 3811 was approved, creating the City of Dapitan [1]. Section 86 of the Act provided that the City Government shall be organized upon approval of the Act and that incumbent municipal officials shall continue in office [2].

On September 5, 1963, petitioners filed their certificates of candidacy for the newly created positions of City Mayor and City Councilors [1]. The Secretary of Justice opined that upon filing these certificates, petitioners were considered resigned under Section 27 of the Election Code for running for an office different from the one they were holding (municipal vs. city) [3], [4]. Consequently, the President appointed the respondents to the city positions [3]. Petitioners filed a *quo warranto* petition with the Supreme Court [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners were considered resigned from their positions under Section 27 of the Election Code upon filing their certificates of candidacy for city officials.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioners were not resigned. Under Section 86 of the Dapitan City Charter (R.A. 3811), the City Government was organized immediately upon the approval of the Act on June 22, 1963 [4]. From that date, the municipal government ceased to exist as it could not co-exist with the city government, and the petitioners automatically became City Mayor and Councilors [4].

Therefore, when petitioners filed their certificates of candidacy on September 5, 1963, they were already holding the positions of City Mayor and Councilors [6]. Since they were running for the exact same posts they were currently holding, Section 27 of the Election Code—which applies only to officials running for an office *other* than the one actually held—did not apply [7], [6]. The petition for *quo warranto* was granted, and respondents were declared not entitled to the offices [6].
