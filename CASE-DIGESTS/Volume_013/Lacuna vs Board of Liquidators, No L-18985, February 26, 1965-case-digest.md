I. CAPTION
SALVADOR D. LACUNA v. BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, PEDRO Q. MOLINA, and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18985, February 26, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Salvador D. Lacuna filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the Supreme Court's Resolution promulgated on November 28, 1964 [1, 2]. The previous Resolution had ordered the remand of the records to the court of origin to allow the assignor, Cirilo Damian, to intervene as an indispensable party [2]. Simultaneous with Lacuna's motion, Cirilo Damian filed a Verified Urgent Manifestation waiving his right to intervene in the suit [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration should be granted.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration for having been filed out of time [2]. The Court reiterated its previous order remanding the case to the court of origin, expressly directing that proceedings be limited to the presentation of evidence by the intervenor-appellant, Cirilo S. Damian, and the corresponding rebuttal evidence by the other parties, effectively disregarding the intervenor's manifestation of waiver [1, 2]. The motion was denied [3].
