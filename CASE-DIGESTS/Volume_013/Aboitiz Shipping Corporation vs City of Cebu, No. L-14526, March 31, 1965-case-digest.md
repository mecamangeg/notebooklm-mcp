I. CAPTION
ABOITIZ SHIPPING CORPORATION, ET AL. v. THE CITY OF CEBU, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14526, March 31, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Aboitiz Shipping Corporation and other shipping companies paid wharfage dues to the City of Cebu under protest pursuant to City Ordinance No. 207. The City enacted the ordinance based on Section 17(w) of its Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 58), which empowers the Municipal Board to fix charges for watercraft landing at or using "public wharves, docks, levees, or landing places."

The petitioners filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the ordinance void and seek a refund, arguing that the wharves they used were owned by the National Government, not the City. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the Charter made no distinction between wharves owned by the National Government and those owned by the City, and that the authority covered all "public" wharves.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City of Cebu may collect wharfage dues for the use of public wharves owned by the National Government based on its Charter power to charge for the use of "public wharves."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

The Court held that the word "public" in the City Charter describes the nature of the use (generally used by the public), not the ownership [1]. While the wharves are public in character, the right to collect wharfage rests on **ownership** [2]. Wharfage is a charge by way of rent or compensation for the vessel being allowed to lie alongside a wharf [2]. Since the National Government owns the wharves, the right to collect belongs to it, not the City [3].

Furthermore, under the rules of statutory construction, Section 17(w) must be read in relation to Section 17(v) (authorizing the City to construct and maintain wharves) and Section 30 (giving the City Engineer custody of wharves "when erected") [4]. These provisions indicate the legislative intent was to authorize collection of dues only on wharves constructed and owned by the City. The power to tax is not inherent in municipal corporations and must be clearly delegated; any doubt is resolved against the grant [5].

**Judgment reversed; Ordinance No. 207 is declared null and void; Respondents are ordered to refund the collected amounts.**
