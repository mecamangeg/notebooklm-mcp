I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RICARDO ORNALES and ALTO SURETY & INSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-20078, January 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Alto Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. posted a P5,000.00 bond for the provisional liberty of Ricardo Ornales pending his appeal for a theft conviction [1]. Ornales failed to appear for the promulgation of judgment on September 14, 1959 [1]. The trial court ordered his arrest, confiscated the bond, and gave the surety 30 days to produce him [1]. Despite extensions, the surety failed to present the accused, and judgment was rendered against the bond on January 18, 1960 [1]. On March 18, 1960—more than six months late—the surety apprehended Ornales and surrendered him to police authorities [2, 3]. Alto Surety moved to lift the execution order, claiming Ornales had fled without notice and alleging it exerted "long and continuous efforts" to locate him [2]. The lower court denied the motion and a subsequent request to reduce liability [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety's liability on the confiscated bond should be reduced given the subsequent capture of the accused.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court exercised its discretion to reduce the surety's liability. The Court maintains a liberal attitude toward bondsmen who eventually produce the accused, based on the theory that the State's ultimate desire is the enforcement of the sentence rather than monetary reparation [4, 5]. However, the degree of liberality depends on the specific circumstances of each case [5]. In this instance, while the accused was eventually surrendered, the surety failed to detail the specific efforts it exerted to locate him [3]. The Court held that a mere allegation of "long and continuous efforts" does not satisfy the degree of diligence expected of a surety, who acts as the jailer of the principal [3]. Consequently, the liability was not extinguished but reduced from P5,000.00 to P2,500.00 [3].

The order appealed from is MODIFIED [6].
