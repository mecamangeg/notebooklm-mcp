I. CAPTION
JUAN GOLINGCO, ET AL. v. CONCEPCION PEÑA, No. L-24455, April 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
In the execution of a judgment involving a land dispute, a Commissioner was appointed to relocate the property. Appellants Golingco, et al. contended that they had sold only 16 hectares of land to appellee Peña and argued that the Commissioner’s report should have specifically stated the area of the land occupied by Peña to ensure execution aligned with the sale [1]. The Commissioner’s report identified the lands actually in Peña's possession but did not specify the total area [2]. The Court of First Instance of Albay approved the report over appellants' objections, prompting this appeal [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner's report was defective for failing to state the specific area of the land occupied by the appellee.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found the appellants' contention without merit. While appellants claimed in their answer that they sold only 16 hectares, the lower court’s decision was silent on the specific area and instead noted that appellants had expressly recognized the appellee's possession and ownership of the lands she occupied [4]. Since it was not denied that the Commissioner relocated the lands actually in the possession of the appellee, it was unnecessary for the report to state the specific area [5, 6]. The relocation as performed was sufficient to prevent any encroachment by the appellee upon the remaining lands of the appellants [6].

Order affirmed [7].
