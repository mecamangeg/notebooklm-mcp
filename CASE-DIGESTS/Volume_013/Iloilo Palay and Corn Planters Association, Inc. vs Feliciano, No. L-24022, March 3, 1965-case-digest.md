I. CAPTION
ILOILO PALAY AND CORN PLANTERS ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL. v. HON. JOSE Y. FELICIANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24022, March 3, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On December 26, 1964, respondent Jose Y. Feliciano, Chairman and General Manager of the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA), wrote the President urging the immediate importation of 595,400 metric tons of rice based on a National Economic Council (NEC) certification of a rice shortage constituting a national emergency. The President approved the importation and designated the RCA to undertake it. Feliciano then announced a bidding scheduled for February 1, 1965.

Petitioners, an association of planters and a taxpayer, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction to stop the importation. They argued that Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3452, Section 10, expressly prohibits the government from importing rice and leaves importation to private parties. Respondents countered that R.A. No. 2207, Section 2, which allows the President to authorize government importation during a national emergency certified by the NEC, still stands and justifies the action.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N R.A. No. 3452 repealed R.A. No. 2207 regarding government authority to import rice.
2. W/N the RCA is authorized to import rice despite the prohibition in R.A. No. 3452.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that R.A. No. 3452 did not expressly or impliedly repeal R.A. No. 2207. Implied repeals are not favored unless there is an irreconcilable inconsistency. The Court reconciled the two laws: R.A. No. 3452 authorizes importation by private parties during normal times or minor shortages. However, R.A. No. 2207 applies to situations where there is a shortage of such gravity as to constitute a national emergency certified by the NEC. In such emergency cases, the government may import. Since the NEC certified a national emergency, R.A. No. 2207 applies [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Under Section 2 of R.A. No. 2207, the President may designate any government agency to undertake importation during a certified national emergency. The prohibition in Section 10 of R.A. No. 3452 against government importation applies only to normal conditions. Consequently, the President validly designated the RCA to import rice to stave off the emergency [1, 3]. The Court also rejected the argument regarding lack of appropriation, noting that under R.A. 663 (transferred to RCA by R.A. 3452), the corporation has the power to borrow and secure funds [4].

Petition dismissed; writ of preliminary injunction dissolved.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Dissenting):**
Argued that R.A. No. 3452 expressly prohibits *any* government agency from importing rice and penalizes violations, thereby repealing the inconsistent provisions of R.A. No. 2207. He contended that R.A. No. 3452 intended to leave all importation to private parties and that "emergency" under the new law refers to hoarding, punishable by seizure, not government importation [5-7].
