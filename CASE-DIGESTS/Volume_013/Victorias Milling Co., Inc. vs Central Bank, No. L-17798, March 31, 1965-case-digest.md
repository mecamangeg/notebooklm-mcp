**I. CAPTION**
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17798, March 31, 1965, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
Victorias Milling Co., Inc. (Appellee) filed a claim for the refund of exchange taxes paid on imported bags used for export, pursuant to Section 3 of Republic Act No. 601 [1, 2]. The Central Bank (Appellant) admitted the bags were used and exported but rejected the claim for P151,756.06, arguing that the right to demand the refund had prescribed [1]. Relying on the ruling in *Belman Cia., Inc. v. Central Bank*, the Central Bank contended that the prescriptive period is six years, treating the obligation as one arising from *solutio indebiti* [1, 3]. The Appellee maintained that the applicable period is ten years [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Victorias Milling [5]. The Central Bank appealed, further arguing that the period runs from the date of payment and that the National Treasurer is an indispensable party [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the applicable prescriptive period for the refund claim is six years.
2. W/N the prescriptive period begins from the date of payment of the exchange tax.
3. W/N the National Treasurer is an indispensable party to the suit.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The applicable prescriptive period is **ten years** [2, 8]. The Court distinguished this case from *Belman*, which involved an illegal collection amounting to *solutio indebiti* (a quasi-contract prescribing in six years under Art. 1145 of the Civil Code) [3]. Here, the tax collection was proper and authorized; the refund is demanded based on a positive provision of law, Section 3 of R.A. No. 601 [2]. Therefore, the obligation is one created by law, governed by Article 1144 of the New Civil Code, which provides a ten-year prescriptive period [2].

2. **NO.** The prescriptive period must be counted from the **date of exportation**, not the date of payment [6]. Section 3 of R.A. No. 601 authorizes a refund only upon the exportation of the containers; thus, the right to the refund—and the corresponding right of action—accrues only at that moment [6].

3. **NO.** The National Treasurer is **not an indispensable party** [9]. Citing *Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. Central Bank*, the Court held that suits under Section 3 of R.A. No. 601 may be instituted against the Central Bank alone [10]. Section 5 of the same Act explicitly mandates that refunds "shall be made by the Central Bank of the Philippines" [10].

**Decision affirmed.** [8, 11]
