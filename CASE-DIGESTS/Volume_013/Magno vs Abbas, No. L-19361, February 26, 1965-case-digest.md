I. CAPTION
PEPITO MAGNO v. HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS and THE PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF DAVAO, G.R. No. L-19361, February 26, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pepito Magno was charged with Robbery with Rape, a capital offense, in the Court of First Instance of Davao (Criminal Case No. 7155) [1]. He filed a motion for bail, which respondent Judge Macapanton Abbas denied [1]. In the denial order, the Judge stated that the evidence presented during the summary hearing showed Magno participated in the offense and that "the least that can be said... is that the proof of guilt of the accused is presumptively strong" [2]. Magno filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that the Judge committed grave abuse of discretion by denying bail based merely on a "strong presumption of guilt," whereas the Constitution and Rules of Court require "strong evidence of guilt" to deny bail in capital cases [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying bail based on the phrase "proof of guilt... is presumptively strong."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's contention was without merit [3]. A reading of the disputed order clearly showed that, in the opinion of the respondent judge, the evidence presented during the summary hearing established that the accused participated in the commission of the charged offense [3]. Casting aside the imprecise wording regarding "presumption," the Court ruled that the respondent judge effectively found that the evidence of guilt presented against the petitioner was strong [3]. This finding justifies the denial of bail in capital offenses [3].

The petition was dismissed and the writ prayed for was denied [4].
