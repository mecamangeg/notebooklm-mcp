I. CAPTION
**ASSOCIATED REALTY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, INC. v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, KEATER HUANG and TAN GIOK TIN, G.R. No. L-18056, January 30, 1965, Paredes, J.**

II. FACTS
Petitioner Associated Realty purchased a parcel of land in Manila in 1946 for subdivision but faced difficulties ejecting tenant-occupants. Respondent Keater Huang, a tenant, assisted in mediating a settlement. In consideration for his services, Petitioner awarded Huang an "estero lot" adjacent to Lot 24. Huang also purchased Lot 24 (stated area of 52 sq. m.) from Petitioner for P6,760.00 (P130/sq. m.) and paid in full in 1947. Petitioner delivered possession of both lots, and Huang constructed a house and fence.

Later, it was discovered that Lot 24 was only 45 sq. m. (short of 7 sq. m.) and the estero lot actually belonged to the government, making transfer of title impossible. Respondents filed a complaint for damages in 1954. The Trial Court awarded minimal damages. The Court of Appeals (CA) modified the judgment, finding Petitioner guilty of fraud and bad faith, and ordering it to pay the 1954 market value of the lots (P300/sq. m.) and the house, totaling P57,890.00. Petitioner appealed, arguing the CA erred in its findings of fact and in awarding damages based on the increased market value (*lucro cesante*).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court may review the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals regarding fraud and bad faith.
2. W/N Petitioner is liable for the value of the estero lot and the increased market value of Lot 24 despite the absence of fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the Supreme Court is generally bound by the CA's findings of fact, it may review them when the indictments are serious enough to subject parties to criminal responsibility (such as fraud) and are alleged to be unsubstantiated by evidence. Upon review, the Court found the charge of fraud and bad faith unsubstantiated and deleted that portion of the decision. However, this does not exonerate Petitioner from civil liability for failing to fulfill its contractual obligations [1].

2. **YES.** Regarding the estero lot, it was payment for services rendered. Since Petitioner cannot deliver the agreed property through its own fault (lack of ownership), it must indemnify Respondents for the reasonable value of the lot [2].

Regarding Lot 24, Respondents paid in full in 1947 but Petitioner failed to deliver the title. The market price increased from P130/sq. m. in 1947 to P300/sq. m. when the complaint was filed in 1954. Under **Article 2200 of the Civil Code** (cited as Art. 220 in the text), indemnification includes not only the loss suffered but also the profits the obligee failed to obtain (*lucro cesante*). *Lucro cesante* is the price the thing could have commanded on the date the obligation should have been fulfilled. Therefore, Petitioner is liable for the difference in price and must pay the value at the time of the complaint (*Borromeo v. Manila Electric Railroad*). Furthermore, since the house and lot are now useless to Respondents due to the reduction in area and shape, Petitioner must pay the value of the house (less depreciation) and the lot, and take over the property [3], [4].

**Decision affirmed with modification.**
