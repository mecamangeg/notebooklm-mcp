I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEONIDAS S. TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEONIDAS S. TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19694, March 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Leonidas S. Tan, a citizen of the Republic of China, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Leyte on March 18, 1961 [1]. He alleged that he had resided in Abuyog, Leyte since his birth in 1937 and was an employee with an average annual income of P2,000.00 [1]. During the hearing, it was established that while he visited Leyte occasionally, he had been employed as a salesman in Manila since 1958, residing there for the three years preceding the petition [1, 2]. His income later increased to P250.00 a month [1]. He presented two character witnesses from Leyte [1]. The lower court granted the petition, finding he possessed all qualifications. The Republic appealed, questioning the venue, the qualifications of the witnesses, and the sufficiency of his income [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance of Leyte was the proper venue for the petition.
2. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner's good moral character.
3. W/N the petitioner proved he had a lucrative occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The residence requirement for determining venue in naturalization cases refers to legal residence or domicile, not physical presence [3]. It is the place from which one might be temporarily absent but always intends to return [3]. Since the petitioner did not intend to abandon his legal residence in Leyte, as evidenced by his occasional visits, the venue was properly laid in Leyte [3].

2. **NO.** While the character witnesses from Leyte may have known the petitioner's behavior while he was in that province, they were not qualified to vouch for his good moral character during his three-year stay in Manila [2]. Witnesses cannot be considered "insurers" of the applicant's character for periods when he lived away from their observation [2]. Consequently, the petitioner failed to prove proper and irreproachable conduct during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines as required by law [2].

3. **NO.** The petitioner’s basic income of P2,000.00 to P3,000.00 annually is insufficient to meet the requirement of a lucrative occupation under the Revised Naturalization Law [4]. This amount is deemed inadequate in view of the high cost of living and the low value of the currency [4].

**Decision reversed; petition dismissed.** [4]
