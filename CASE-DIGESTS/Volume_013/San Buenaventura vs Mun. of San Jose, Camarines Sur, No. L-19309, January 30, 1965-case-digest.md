I. CAPTION
VICENTE SAN BUENAVENTURA v. MUNICIPALITY OF SAN JOSE, CAMARINES SUR, MAXIMINO ABRAGAN and STANLY PEÑA, G.R. No. L-19309, January 30, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On August 7, 1959, the Municipal Council of San Jose held a public bidding for fishery zones, awarding the lease to respondent Abragan as the highest bidder [1]. The lease was set to expire on December 31, 1959 [1]. On November 17, 1959, the Council passed Resolution No. 75 extending Abragan’s lease by six months (to June 30, 1960) without a new public bidding [1]. Abragan then assigned his rights to respondent Peña, which the Council approved via Resolution No. 79 [1]. Subsequently, the Council passed Resolution No. 80 extending the lease to Peña for another five years, again without public bidding [1, 2]. Petitioner San Buenaventura, a resident interested in bidding, filed a petition for declaratory relief challenging the validity of these resolutions [2]. The lower court declared Resolutions 75 and 80 null and void for violating the requirement of public bidding [3]. Respondents appealed, arguing inter alia that the petition should be dismissed for failure to notify the Provincial Fiscal under Rule 66 of the Rules of Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Council can validly extend the period of a fishery lease without conducting a new public bidding.
2. W/N the failure to notify the Provincial Fiscal in a petition for declaratory relief is a jurisdictional defect warranting dismissal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The extensions granted via Resolutions No. 75 and 80 are null and void. The Court held that the applicable law is not the Revised Administrative Code, but Sections 67 and 69 of Act No. 4003 (Fisheries Act) [6]. Under Section 69, while a municipal council may lease fishery privileges for a period not exceeding five years without Provincial Board approval, such lease must invariably be "let to the highest bidder" [7, 8]. An extension of a lease term is tantamount to a new lease and must be based on a new competitive public bidding to protect the public interest [9, 10]. Since Resolutions 75 and 80 were passed without public bidding, they are void; consequently, Resolution 79 approving the assignment of the void lease is also ineffective [10, 11].

2. **NO.** The requirement under Section 5, Rule 66 (now Rule 64) regarding notification to the Provincial Fiscal of the pendency of an action involving the validity of a municipal ordinance is not jurisdictional [12, 13]. The purpose is merely to give the Fiscal a chance to participate. Failure to notify is not sufficient ground to dismiss the case, especially where the resolutions in question are patently illegal [13].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [14].
