I. CAPTION
REGISTER OF DEEDS, petitioner-appellee, vs. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, oppositor-appellant, G.R. No. L-17641, January 30, 1965, 13 SCRA 46, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Datu Sinarimbo Binasing was the registered owner of four lots under Original Certificates of Title (OCT) issued in 1935 [1, 2]. In 1938, he sold the lots to Soledad C. de Teruel, and Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) were issued in her name [2]. During the war, the Register of Deeds’ records were destroyed [3].

In 1947, Binasing fraudulently secured new OCTs for the same lots by misrepresenting that he had never secured titles for them [3]. He then mortgaged these lots to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to secure a loan [3]. PNB subsequently foreclosed on the mortgage and purchased the lots as the highest bidder [3]. Meanwhile, Teruel reconstituted her TCTs in 1948 [4]. Upon discovering the double titling, the Register of Deeds filed a petition to cancel the titles issued to Binasing [4]. The lower court ordered the cancellation of Binasing’s titles and upheld Teruel’s titles [5]. PNB appealed, arguing it was an innocent mortgagee for value entitled to protection under the Torrens system [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N PNB, as an innocent mortgagee for value, is entitled to protection under the Torrens system despite the existence of a prior valid title.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that the indefeasibility of a Torrens title can only be claimed if a previous valid title to the same parcel of land does not exist [6]. Since Binasing’s titles were issued in 1947 through fraud, they cannot prevail over Teruel’s valid titles acquired in 1938 [7].

Applying the maxim *prior in tempore, potior in jure* (he who is first in time is preferred in right), the Court ruled that a certificate of title is not conclusive evidence of ownership if the land had already been registered and an earlier certificate exists [6, 7]. Consequently, PNB cannot validly hold title to the land, although its right to recover against Binasing or the Assurance Fund is reserved [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
