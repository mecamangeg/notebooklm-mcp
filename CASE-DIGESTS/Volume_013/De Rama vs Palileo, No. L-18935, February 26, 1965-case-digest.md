I. CAPTION
IN RE: INTESTATE ESTATE OF BEATRIZ C. DE RAMA; ANGELO O. DE RAMA v. CHERIE PALILEO, G.R. No. L-18935, February 26, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In the settlement of the intestate estate of Beatriz C. de Rama, the Court of First Instance of Rizal issued a notice to creditors requiring claims to be filed within six months. The first notice was published on August 13, 1958. The period expired without any claims being filed, and the court subsequently approved the administrator's final account and project of partition on May 12, 1960.

On June 7, 1961, Cherie Palileo petitioned for permission to file a claim against the estate. She alleged that on May 6, 1961, the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision (CA-G.R. No. 22556-R) awarding her damages against the deceased. Administrator Angelo de Rama opposed the petition, arguing the claim was filed beyond the prescribed period. The lower court allowed Palileo to file her claim within one month, reasoning that no final decree of distribution had been entered yet. The administrator appealed this order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court abused its discretion in allowing the filing of a money claim after the expiration of the period prescribed in the notice to creditors.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that the period prescribed in the notice to creditors is not exclusive [1]. Under Section 2 of Rule 87 of the old Rules of Court (now Rule 86), money claims against the estate may be allowed at any time before an order of distribution is entered, at the discretion of the court, for cause and upon such terms as are equitable [1, 2]. This extension, however, shall not exceed one month from the issuance of the order authorizing it [1].

The Court found that Palileo had sufficient cause for the delay. She could not have filed the claim earlier because the award of damages was only established upon the promulgation of the Court of Appeals decision on May 6, 1961, which was after the six-month period in the notice had already elapsed [3]. Since no order of distribution had been entered, the trial court's relaxation of the rule to admit the claim was not an abuse of discretion [3]. The order appealed from is affirmed [4].
