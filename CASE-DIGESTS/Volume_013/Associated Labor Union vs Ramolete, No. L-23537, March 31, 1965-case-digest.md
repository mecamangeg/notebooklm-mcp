I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED LABOR UNION, DEMOCRITO T. MENDOZA and CECILIO T. SENO v. THE HON. JUDGE MODESTO R. RAMOLETE, KATIPUNAN LUMBER CO., INC., and ROQUE ABELLAR, G.R. No. L-23537, March 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Katipunan Lumber Co., Inc. (Katipunan) contracted respondent Roque Abellar to furnish labor for non-routinary operations. On September 3, 1964, Katipunan and Abellar filed a complaint for Injunction and Damages against petitioners (Associated Labor Union) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. The complaint alleged that the union was illegally interfering with their contractual obligations through threats and coercion, and specifically averred that no employer-employee relationship existed between Katipunan and Abellar's laborers [1, 2]. Based on these allegations, respondent Judge Ramolete issued a writ of preliminary injunction *ex parte* [3, 4].

Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Lift the Writ, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the case involved a labor dispute protected by Republic Act No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act) [5]. However, without waiting for the CFI to resolve this motion, petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [6]. Meanwhile, the lower court deferred resolving the motion to receive evidence on the existence of a labor dispute, and petitioners subsequently filed an Answer and entered pre-trial in the lower court [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is premature.
2. W/N the CFI had jurisdiction to issue the injunctive writ based on the complaint's allegations.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petition is premature. A petition for certiorari filed before the lower court can resolve a pending motion for reconsideration is improper because it deprives the trial court of the opportunity to correct itself. The Court cited *Villa-Rey Transit v. Bello*, ruling that such action renders the petition premature [9, 10]. Furthermore, certiorari does not lie when other adequate remedies exist; here, petitioners had already availed of their remedy in the lower court by filing an Answer and participating in pre-trial [8, 11].

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint. Since the complaint alleged a civil case for damages arising from interference with contractual obligations and expressly denied an employer-employee relationship, the CFI had jurisdiction to issue the writ *ex parte* [12]. The mere assertion of a labor dispute in a motion for reconsideration does not automatically deprive the court of jurisdiction but merely necessitates a hearing to establish the facts, which the respondent Judge properly ordered [9, 12].

The petition is **DISMISSED** [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Reyes, J.B.L., J., Concurring:**
Justice Reyes concurred in the result but emphasized that lower courts must immediately hear and decide if a labor dispute exists. Deferring the hearing beyond the statutory five-day lifespan of an *ex parte* labor injunction under Sec. 9(d) of R.A. 875 effectively maintains the injunction illegally and nullifies the law's protection of labor [13, 14].
