I. CAPTION
PERFECTO BONILLA v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and FRANKLIN BAKER COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20730, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Perfecto Bonilla was employed as a latheman by respondent Franklin Baker Company starting in 1952. On January 20, 1961, while tightening a lathe chuck, he felt pain in his scrotum and was subsequently treated and operated on for hernia. Bonilla filed a claim for compensation. It was established that his hernia began while he was still a student, long before his employment, and he had made no complaints during his first nine years of work. The Hearing Officer initially approved the claim, but the case was referred to the Evaluation Division of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC). The WCC medical report concluded that the hernia was of long-standing origin and not causally related to his work. The WCC rendered a decision (presumably reversing the Hearing Officer) which Bonilla appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the hernia suffered by the petitioner is compensable as an injury arising out of or aggravated by his employment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission. The Court relied on the WCC Evaluation Division's prerequisites for compensable hernia: (1) the hernia is of recent origin; (2) its appearance was accompanied by pain, discoloration, and evidence of tearing of tissues; (3) it was immediately preceded by some strain out of and in the course of employment; and (4) a protrusion appeared immediately following the strain.

In this case, the hernia was of long-standing origin (pre-existing from student days) and not recent. There was no evidence of discoloration or tissue tearing necessitating immediate operation. The eventual operation was caused by the progressive enlargement of the pre-formed sac over ten years, not by the alleged strain at work. Consequently, there was no causal relationship between the ailment and the nature of Bonilla's work. The Court emphasized that findings of fact by the WCC, when supported by substantial evidence, are binding on appeal.

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
