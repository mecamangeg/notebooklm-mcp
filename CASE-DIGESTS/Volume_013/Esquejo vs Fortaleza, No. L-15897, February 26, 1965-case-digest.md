I. CAPTION
AUREA ESQUEJO v. CERAPIO FORTALEZA and DANIEL FORTALEZA, G.R. No. L-15897, February 26, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Aurea Esquejo filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan to recover a residential lot she claimed was donated to her *propter nuptias* by Pablo Fortaleza. The CFI acknowledged the donation but denied recovery, finding that the lot was actually the registered property of a third party, Pedro Fortaleza (covered by OCT No. 4322), and had been validly sold by Pedro’s heirs to defendant Cerapio Fortaleza. The trial court concluded that the donor, Pablo, did not own the land he donated.

Esquejo appealed directly to the Supreme Court, expressly stating in her notice of appeal that she would raise "only questions of law." However, in her arguments, she disputed the trial court's factual finding that the land donated to her and the registered land sold to Cerapio were the same property, contending they were distinct parcels [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant may raise questions of fact after limiting the appeal to questions of law in the notice of appeal.
2. W/N the donor validly conveyed the property to the plaintiff.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that an appellant’s statement in the notice of appeal that only questions of law would be raised constitutes a waiver of all questions of fact, pursuant to Rule 42, Section 2 of the Revised Rules of Court. Consequently, Esquejo was barred from disputing the lower court's factual finding that the residential land donated to her was identical to the land registered under OCT No. 4322 [4, 5].

2. **NO.** Since the facts established that the land was the registered property of Pedro Fortaleza, and the plaintiff failed to prove how her donor, Pablo Fortaleza, acquired it from the registered owner, the donation could not convey title. The Court applied the principle of law that "nobody can dispose of that which does not belong to him." Since the donor had no right, title, or interest in the land, he could not lawfully convey it to the donee [6].

**Decision affirmed.**
