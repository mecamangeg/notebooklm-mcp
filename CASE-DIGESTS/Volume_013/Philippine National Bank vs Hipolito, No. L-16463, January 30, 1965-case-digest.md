I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. HERMOGENES HIPOLITO and LEONOR JUNSAY, G.R. No. L-16463, January 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On June 18, 1959, Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint against respondents Hipolito and Junsay to recover a balance of P11,999.73 derived from sugar crop loans secured by promissory notes dated between January and June 1941. To counter the defense of prescription, the complaint alleged that on May 7, 1957, the respondents offered a plan of payment which constituted an acknowledgment of the obligation.

Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription. They attached a joint affidavit of merit denying that they ever made an acknowledgment of indebtedness or offered a plan of payment. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental dismissed the complaint, ruling that the ten-year prescriptive period from the 1941 notes had already elapsed in 1953, and that the alleged offer of payment was not proven and was denied by the respondents. PNB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court correctly dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription based on the respondents' denial of the alleged offer of payment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was erroneous because in a motion to dismiss, the defendant hypothetically admits the truth of the allegations of fact contained in the complaint.

The complaint expressly alleged that the respondents made an offer of payment on May 7, 1957. Under the law, such an offer works as a renewal of the obligation and prevents prescription from setting in. While the respondents denied this offer in their affidavit of merit, such denial constitutes a contrary averment of fact that is proper in an answer to the complaint, not in a motion to dismiss. Contradictory allegations require the presentation of evidence. Since the ground for dismissal was not indubitable, the lower court should have deferred the determination of the issue until after the trial of the case on the merits (Sec. 3, Rule 16, Revised Rules of Court).

The Order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings.
