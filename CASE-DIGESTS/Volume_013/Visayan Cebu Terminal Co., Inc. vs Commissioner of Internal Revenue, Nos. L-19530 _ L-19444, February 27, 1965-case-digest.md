I. CAPTION
VISAYAN CEBU TERMINAL CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-19530 & L-19444, February 27, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Visayan Cebu Terminal Co., Inc. (Petitioner) entered into a Management Agreement with the Bureau of Customs to manage the arrastre service at the Port of Cebu. Under the contract, Petitioner agreed to pay the Bureau 28% of its total monthly gross income [1, 2]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) demanded payment of percentage taxes and penalties from Petitioner. Petitioner protested, claiming it was merely an employee/agent of the Bureau of Customs and thus exempt, citing a memorandum from BIR examiners supporting this view [2]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that Petitioner was liable for the 3% percentage tax as an arrastre contractor under Section 191 of the Tax Code but held that the 28% share paid to the Bureau of Customs should be excluded from the taxable gross receipts [3, 4]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Petitioner is liable for the 3% percentage tax as an arrastre contractor.
2. W/N the 28% share paid to the Bureau of Customs should be included in the Petitioner's taxable gross receipts.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Petitioner is liable. The Supreme Court held that the nature of the work—handling cargoes at piers—clearly makes Petitioner an arrastre contractor subject to the 3% percentage tax under Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code [6]. The Management Agreement explicitly refers to Petitioner as "Contractor," and the payment of 28% to the Bureau does not alter this status into one of agency; otherwise, the alleged "agent" (Petitioner) would be receiving 72% while the "principal" (Bureau) received only 28%, which is illogical [6, 7]. Furthermore, the government is not estopped from collecting legitimate taxes due to errors committed by its agents [8].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the CTA's ruling that the 28% share is not taxable. Gross receipts subject to the 3% contractor's tax should not include money which, although delivered to the contractor, has been especially earmarked by regulation or contract for the government or another person [4]. Citing *Commissioner v. Manila Jockey Club*, the Court ruled it would be unjust to tax the Petitioner on funds that ultimately belong to the Bureau of Customs [4, 9].

Decision affirmed [10].
