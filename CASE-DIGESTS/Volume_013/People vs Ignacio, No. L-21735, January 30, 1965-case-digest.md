**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE IGNACIO Y SANTOS**, G.R. No. L-21735, January 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Defendant-appellant Jose Ignacio y Santos was charged with estafa thru falsification of a commercial document involving a P4,608.62 Philippine National Bank check. Upon arraignment, he pleaded guilty. The Court of First Instance of Manila sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *prision correccional* as minimum, to four (4) years, nine (9) months, and eleven (11) days of *prision correccional* as maximum, plus indemnity and fine [1]. Ignacio appealed, contending that the court erred in fixing the minimum term of his sentence by failing to consider the mitigating circumstance of his plea of guilty [2]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a pure question of law [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty should be considered in determining the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that for purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty next lower should be determined without regard to whether the basic penalty provided by the Code should be applied in its maximum or minimum period as circumstances modifying liability may require, citing *People v. Mape* [4].

The penalty next lower to that prescribed for the crime (estafa thru falsification) is *arresto mayor* in its maximum period to *prision correccional* in its minimum period (4 months and 1 day to 2 years and 4 months) [5]. The trial court's imposed minimum of 1 year, 8 months, and 1 day falls within this range [5]. The Court ruled that the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty is considered in fixing the *maximum* term, but not the *minimum*. In the absence of abuse, the discretion of the court to fix the minimum term anywhere within the range provided by law will not be interfered with [2].

**Judgment affirmed.**
