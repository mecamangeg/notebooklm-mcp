I. CAPTION
CHUA CHE v. PHILIPPINES PATENT OFFICE and SY TUO, G.R. No. L-18337, January 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chua Che filed an application with the Philippines Patent Office to register the trademark "X-7" for soap (Class 51), alleging first use on June 10, 1957 [1, 2]. Respondent Sy Tuo opposed the application, claiming he had extensively used the trademark "X-7" for perfumes, lipsticks, and nail polish since July 31, 1953, and held a prior registration (No. 5,000) [3-5]. Sy Tuo argued that Chua Che's registration would violate his rights and confuse the public [3].

The Director of Patents denied Chua Che's application, ruling that Sy Tuo had priority of use and that average purchasers would likely associate "X-7" laundry soap with Sy Tuo's cosmetics, attributing them to a common origin or sponsorship [6-8]. Chua Che appealed, arguing the Director erred in finding priority of use and that no confusion would result because the goods belonged to different categories [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the finding of the Director of Patents regarding priority of use is conclusive upon the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the registration of the trademark should be refused due to likelihood of confusion, even though the goods fall under different categories.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the finding of the Director of Patents regarding the priority of use and adoption of the trademark is, for all intents and purposes, a finding of fact [10, 11]. In appeals from the Patent Office, only questions of law should ordinarily be raised; findings of fact are conclusive on the Supreme Court unless they are not supported by substantial evidence [10, 11]. Thus, the finding that Sy Tuo had priority of use was binding [11].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that registration of a trademark should be refused where there is a likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception, even though the goods fall into different categories [9, 12]. Citing *Application of Sylvan Sweets Co.*, the Court rejected Chua Che's contention that the difference in products (laundry soap vs. cosmetics) prevented infringement [9]. Since both products are common household items, the Director's finding that purchasers would likely associate them with a common origin or sponsorship was well taken [9, 13].

The decision of the Director of Patents was affirmed [13].
