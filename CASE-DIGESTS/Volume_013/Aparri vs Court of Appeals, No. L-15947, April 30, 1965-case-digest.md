I. CAPTION
JOSE F. APARRI v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, SALVACION E. VDA. DE FERRO and LINO BAJAR, Sheriff of Masbate, G.R. No. L-15947, April 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jose F. Aparri mortgaged land to PNB to secure a loan. Subsequently, a criminal case for malversation was filed against him, resulting in a writ of preliminary attachment on his properties, including the mortgaged land [1]. PNB extrajudicially foreclosed on the mortgage, and Respondent Salvacion E. Vda. de Ferro purchased the property at auction for P1,500 [2]. After paying PNB and sheriff fees, a surplus of P477.40 remained, which the Sheriff retained to satisfy the junior attachment lien from the criminal case [2].

Within the redemption period, Aparri tendered P1,265.32 to Ferro, arguing the P477.40 held by the Sheriff should be credited to complete the redemption price [3, 4]. Ferro refused the tender as insufficient. The Sheriff also refused to execute a deed of sale to Ferro or a certificate of redemption to Aparri [3]. Ferro filed for mandamus. The CFI ruled in favor of Ferro, ordering the Sheriff to convey the property to her [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the surplus proceeds from an extrajudicial foreclosure sale must be applied to junior liens before the mortgagor.
2. W/N Aparri’s tender of payment was valid to effect redemption.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While Act No. 3135 is silent on the disposition of surplus proceeds, the Supreme Court held that the rule and practice in judicial foreclosure sales (Rule 68) applies to extrajudicial sales by analogy [7]. Under Rule 68, Section 4, the residue of the sale proceeds after paying the main debt and costs must be applied to junior encumbrancers in order of priority [8]. Therefore, the P477.40 surplus was correctly retained by the Sheriff to cover the Government's junior attachment lien and cannot be claimed by the mortgagor unless the junior lien is satisfied [7, 9].

2. **NO.** Under Rule 39, Section 30, redemption requires the payment of the purchase price plus 1% monthly interest [10]. Aparri's tender was insufficient as it fell short by P477.40 [4]. A redemptioner cannot compel the purchaser to accept a promissory note or an amount held by a third person (the Sheriff) that is subject to an adverse claim by another party [10].

The petition is denied and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [11].
