I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO G. ALEJA, FELICITACION GAMBOA-ALEJA and DOMINADOR ALEJA v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-18529, February 26, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Rosauro G. Aleja was appointed as a temporary classroom teacher on July 8, 1958. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) issued a compulsory term insurance policy in his name, specifically stating it would take effect on February 1, 1959, pursuant to Section 8 of Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 186. This provision mandated that employees appointed on days other than the first of the month become automatically insured on the first day of the seventh calendar month following their appointment. Rosauro died on January 29, 1959, two days before the policy's effective date. The first premium was deducted from his salary posthumously on January 31, 1959. The plaintiffs, beneficiaries of Rosauro, filed a claim which GSIS denied on the ground that the deceased was not covered at the time of death. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, ruling that the policy was not yet effective.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the beneficiaries can recover proceeds from the insurance policy given that the insured died before the policy's stated effective date.
2. W/N Section 8 of CA 186 is valid and constitutional despite classifying the start date of coverage based on the date of appointment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the beneficiaries cannot recover because there was no existing contract at the time of death. The policy explicitly fixed the effective date as February 1, 1959, and Rosauro died on January 29, 1959 [1]. Furthermore, the premium was only deducted after his death, meaning there was no consideration for the risk sought to be enforced [1]. Since the insured died before the effective date, he was not yet covered by the insurance [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the classification in Section 8 of CA 186 is valid. While the law distinguishes between employees appointed on the first day of the month (insured on the first day of the sixth month) and those appointed on other dates (insured on the first day of the seventh month), this classification is not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious [3]. The measure was incorporated to promote efficiency and convenience in the System's office procedures given the volume of business it handles [1]. A classification does not infringe on constitutional guarantees of equality if it is based on substantial distinctions, germane to the purpose of the law, not limited to existing conditions, and applies equally to all members of the class [3].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED**; the GSIS is ordered to return the premium amount deducted from the deceased’s salary to the plaintiffs [4].
