I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. JOSE ADOLFO Y RAYMUNDO, G.R. No. L-24191, March 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On April 10, 1963, an accident occurred giving rise to a charge against Jose Adolfo for damage to property through reckless imprudence [1]. Republic Act No. 3828 took effect on June 22, 1963, amending Section 87(c) of the Judiciary Act to grant Municipal Courts original jurisdiction over offenses punishable by a fine of not more than P3,000.00 [2]. Subsequently, on July 30, 1963, the Information against Adolfo was filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, alleging damage to property worth P890.49 [1, 2]. Under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, the maximum penalty was a fine of three times the value of the damage, or P2,671.47 [2].

The CFI found Adolfo guilty and ordered him to pay damages and a fine [1]. Adolfo appealed, questioning the CFI's jurisdiction, arguing that under R.A. 3828, the case fell within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court [1, 2]. The Solicitor General argued that the CFI retained jurisdiction because the offense was committed on April 10, 1963, prior to the effectivity of the amendatory law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the law in force at the time of the commission of the offense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal action is determined not by the law in force at the time of the commission of the offense, but by the law in force at the time of the institution of the action [3].

The Court cited *People v. Pegarum* to support this principle [3]. Since the criminal action was instituted on July 30, 1963, R.A. 3828 was already in effect [1, 2]. Because the maximum imposable penalty was a fine of P2,671.47—which is below the P3,000.00 jurisdictional threshold set by the amendment—the case was cognizable by the Municipal Court, not the CFI [3, 4].

Consequently, the decision appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the information filed therein was **DISMISSED** [4].
