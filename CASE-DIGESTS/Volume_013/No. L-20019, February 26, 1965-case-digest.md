I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. LORENZO GO alias LORENZO CHUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20019, February 26, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Lorenzo Go, also known as Lorenzo Chua, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental on November 16, 1960 [1]. He was single, a student, and employed as a salesman receiving a salary of P150.00 per month (P1,800.00 annually) [1, 2]. The Republic opposed the petition on the ground that his income was not lucrative [1]. The CFI granted the petition, ruling that Go possessed all qualifications [2]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the petitioner’s income did not meet the lucrative standard and that his ability to speak and write a principal Philippine language was not proven [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s income of P150.00 per month constitutes a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner sufficiently proved his ability to speak and write a principal Philippine dialect.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a monthly salary of P150.00 for an unmarried applicant is not considered lucrative or substantial within the contemplation of the Naturalization Law [4]. The Court cited *Ong v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-15764), noting that even a monthly income of P250.00 had been ruled as not lucrative due to the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso [4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there was no evidence in the records to show that the petitioner could speak and write any of the principal dialects of the country [5]. No questions in any dialect were propounded to him to demonstrate his knowledge, and the Court cannot simply presume such ability [5]. It is incumbent upon the applicant to prove he has all qualifications; failing to do so, the Court assumes contrariwise [5].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petitioner is declared not qualified to acquire Philippine citizenship [6].
