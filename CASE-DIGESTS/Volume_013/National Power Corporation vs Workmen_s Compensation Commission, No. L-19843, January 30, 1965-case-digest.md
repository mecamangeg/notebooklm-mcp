**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19843, January 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Enrique Gulmatico was employed as an assistant stockman by the National Power Corporation (NPC). His duties included heavy manual labor, checking materials, and working irregular hours, which often caused him to miss meals or work overtime during emergencies [1]. On November 4, 1956, he worked overtime manually pumping gasoline due to a power shutdown. He inhaled gasoline fumes and felt stomach pain but continued working until the afternoon. That evening, he suffered severe pain and vomiting. He died shortly thereafter from a "ruptured chronic perforating gastric ulcer" [2].

His widow filed a claim for compensation in December 1958, two years after his death. The hearing officer awarded compensation, which the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed [3]. NPC petitioned for review, arguing that the illness was not work-related and that the claim was barred by prescription for being filed beyond the three-month statutory period [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the employee’s death from stomach ulcer is compensable.
2. W/N the claim is barred by prescription due to the late filing by the widow.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While an ulcer is generally not an occupational disease, it becomes compensable when contracted in the course of employment and seriously aggravated by the nature of the work. The Court found that the deceased's work was irregular, causing him to miss meals, and that on the day preceding his illness, he inhaled gasoline fumes which offended his respiratory system and induced nausea. This aggravation of his condition brought the illness within the purview of the law [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The claim is not barred. The employer is obligated to file an Employer’s Report of Accident or Sickness. NPC failed to file this report until after the widow had filed her claim, despite having knowledge of the death immediately (the company physician and supervisor even attended the interment). Citing *Martha Lumber Mill, Inc. v. Lagradante* and *Tan Lim Te v. Workmen’s Compensation Commissioner*, the Court ruled that non-compliance with the reporting requirement constitutes a waiver of the defense that the claim was not filed within the statutory period [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred in the result [8].
