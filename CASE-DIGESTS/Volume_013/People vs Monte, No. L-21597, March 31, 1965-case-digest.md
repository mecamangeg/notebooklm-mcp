I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEANDRO MONTE y CASTRO, G.R. No. L-21597, March 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Leandro Monte y Castro was charged with qualified theft of goods valued at P250.00. Upon arraignment, he waived his right to counsel and pleaded guilty [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila subsequently convicted him and imposed an indeterminate penalty of four years, two months, and one day of *prision correccional* to eight years and one day of *prision mayor* [1, 3].

On appeal, Monte argued that he had voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and that his confession of guilt suppressed his right to introduce evidence. He claimed the trial court erred in failing to consider the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and prayed that the case be remanded to the lower court to allow him to prove said circumstance [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be remanded to the lower court to allow the accused to prove the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that a prayer to remand a case to prove voluntary surrender will not be granted where the record contains nothing to suggest such surrender took place [2, 4].

Although Monte was unrepresented during his plea, his appellate counsel filed the notice of appeal but failed to file a motion in the lower court to establish the mitigating circumstance, offering no explanation for this omission [2]. Furthermore, the appellant failed to submit an affidavit supporting his claim of voluntary surrender [2, 4]. In the absence of an affidavit or a satisfactory explanation showing that the failure to present evidence in the lower court was due to excusable neglect, the relief cannot be granted [2].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
