I. CAPTION
ANG TEE YEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20305, March 31, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 27, 1960, Ang Tee Yee filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The petition and the notice of hearing were published in the Daily Mirror and the Official Gazette [1]. After the hearing, the CFI granted the petition [2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision on several grounds, including the invalidity of the petition [3, 4]. The records revealed that the petitioner was also known by the name "Lim Tee Yee," which appeared in his Alien Registration Certificate and clearance [4]. However, it was not shown that he was authorized to use this alias, nor was this alias included in the publication of his petition for naturalization [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for naturalization should be denied due to the non-inclusion of the petitioner's alias in the publication of the petition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the unexplained and unauthorized use of an alias is sufficient to deny a petition for naturalization, citing *Celerino Yu Seco v. Republic* and *Ong Khan v. Republic* [4]. Furthermore, the non-inclusion of the petitioner's other name ("Lim Tee Yee") in the publication of the application rendered the publication insufficient [4]. The purpose of publication is to inform the public so that those who know the applicant by his alias may come forward with information affecting the application [4]. Because the petition was not sufficiently published, the trial court did not validly acquire jurisdiction over the case, pursuant to the doctrine in *Celestino Co v. Republic* [4].

Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petitioner is denied the right to Philippine citizenship [5].
