I. CAPTION
WONG WOO YIU alias NG YAO v. HON. MARTINIANO P. VIVO, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-21076, March 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Wong Woo Yiu arrived in the Philippines in 1961, seeking admission as a non-quota immigrant on the claim that she was the wife of Perfecto Bias, a Filipino citizen. [2] She alleged that they were married in Chingkang, China on January 15, 1929, before a village leader named Chua Tio. [2] The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) No. 3 initially admitted her, and this was affirmed by the Board of Commissioners (BOC). [2, 3]

However, in 1962, a new set of BOC members *motu proprio* reviewed the case and reversed the admission, ordering her exclusion. [4] The BOC found discrepancies in the records: Perfecto Bias had declared in 1947 that he first visited China in 1935 and married in 1936, contradicting the claim of a 1929 marriage. [5, 6] Petitioner filed a petition for mandamus and certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, which ruled in her favor, declaring the BSI decision valid. [2, 4] Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court. [2]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a marriage celebrated before a village leader in China is valid and recognizable in the Philippines in the absence of proof of Chinese law. [7, 8]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the marriage cannot be recognized in this jurisdiction. [9]

While Article 71 of the New Civil Code (formerly Section 19 of Act No. 3613) provides that a marriage contracted outside the Philippines which is valid under the law of the country of celebration is also valid in the Philippines, this rule requires proof of the foreign law. [8] The statutes of other countries must be pleaded and proved as facts, as courts cannot take judicial notice of them. [10]

In this case, no proof was presented regarding the marriage laws of China. [8] Under the doctrine of processual presumption, in the absence of proof of foreign law, it is presumed to be the same as Philippine law (*Yam Ka Lim v. Collector of Customs*; *Miciano v. Brimo*). [8-10] Philippine law (Public Act 3412, Section 2) authorizes only judges, justices of the peace, and registered priests or ministers to solemnize marriages; it does not recognize a "village leader" as an authorized solemnizing officer. [7, 9] Consequently, the alleged marriage before a village leader, even if true, is not valid under Philippine law and thus cannot be recognized. [7, 9]

**Decision reversed.** [9]
