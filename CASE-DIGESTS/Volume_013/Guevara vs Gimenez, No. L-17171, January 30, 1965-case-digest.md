I. CAPTION
FERNANDO D. GUEVARA v. HON. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, as Auditor General, G.R. No. L-17171, January 30, 1965, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1954, the District Engineer of Sorsogon prepared a program of work for the reconstruction of a school building. The Division Engineer approved the plans with the proviso that painting be included, which was subsequently appended as page six of the specifications [1], [2]. Petitioner Guevara won the bidding, signed the contract—which expressly incorporated the plans and specifications—and completed the project [2], [3]. After receiving the full contract price of P37,500.00, Guevara filed a claim for P4,620.00 for the cost of painting, alleging that the copy of the specifications issued to him lacked the painting requirements [3]. The Auditor General denied the claim [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Guevara is entitled to additional payment for the painting of the building.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the contract validly included the painting of the building and Guevara had been fully paid [4]. The Court applied the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed under Section 5(m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, upholding the government employees' testimony that complete specifications were distributed [5]. Guevara failed to rebut this presumption, as the affidavits of other contractors he presented were deemed to have little probative value [6].

Moreover, the Court held that it is standard practice for contractors to verify specifications and plans before bidding; a contractor who dispenses with this verification bears the consequences of his own negligence [7]. Evidence further showed Guevara was actually aware of the requirement, as he submitted paint samples and his billing vouchers during construction included "painting and varnishing" [8].

The decision of the Auditor General is affirmed [4].
