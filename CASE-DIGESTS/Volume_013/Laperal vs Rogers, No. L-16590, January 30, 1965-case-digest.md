I. CAPTION
ROBERTO LAPERAL v. HON. WILLIAM P. ROGERS, in his capacity as Attorney General of the United States, and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16590, January 30, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Roberto Laperal was the registered owner of a residential property in San Miguel, Manila [1]. On April 12, 1944, he executed a deed of sale conveying the property to the occupation Republic of the Philippines for P500,000.00 in Japanese Military War Notes [1]. Laperal claimed he was forced to sell after being approached by Japanese soldiers, ordered to the Japanese Military Administration, and threatened by General Wachi that his refusal to sell was an act of hostility against the Japanese [2, 3].

After the war, the U.S. Alien Property Custodian vested the property, considering the occupation Republic an instrumentality of the Japanese Army [4]. Laperal filed a claim for return, which was not acted upon, leading him to file an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the sale due to duress [5, 6]. The Republic of the Philippines intervened, claiming title [7]. The CFI ruled in favor of Laperal, declaring the sale null and void due to duress and ordering reconveyance [8]. The defendants appealed, arguing the sale was voluntary or ratified by Laperal's use of the proceeds [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the deed of sale was executed under duress.
2. W/N the sale was ratified by the petitioner's alleged use of the proceeds.
3. W/N the petitioner is entitled to rentals and attorney’s fees.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the transaction was invalid because Laperal acted under a "reasonable and well-grounded fear of suffering and imminent and serious injury to his person or property" [11]. The Court distinguished this from "collective" or "general" duress (general fear of the Japanese occupation), which is insufficient to invalidate a contract. Here, Laperal faced specific threats from high-ranking officers, including General Wachi [12, 13]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Laperal was a wealthy man who had not sold property since 1914 and had no need to sell, and the purchase price was grossly inadequate (P500,000 in war notes was equivalent to only P35,000 in actual currency, while the property was worth roughly P200,000) [12, 14, 15].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the claim of ratification. The document presented by the appellants (Exhibit 1) purporting to show Laperal's bank account history was incomplete, unreliable, and not properly identified by a competent witness [16, 17]. Furthermore, the appellants failed to link the alleged withdrawals to the purchase of other properties [18].

3. **NO.** The Court modified the lower court's decision by deleting the award for rentals and attorney's fees. Since Laperal retained possession of the purchase money and the Republic held the property, equity presumes the benefits were equal [19]. Additionally, the appellants did not act in bad faith in defending the validity of the sale [20].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the award for rentals and attorney's fees is set aside [21].
