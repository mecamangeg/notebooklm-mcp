I. CAPTION
DAMASO P. PEREZ v. COURT OF APPEALS and ARMANDO HERRADURA, G.R. No. L-20238, January 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Armando Herradura was appointed by petitioner Damaso Perez as manager of the D.P. Perez Insurance Agency on August 1, 1958, with a monthly salary of P400.00 [1]. On January 15, 1959, Perez informed Herradura that due to his failure to produce the promised amount of business, he would be shifted to a commission-only basis effective immediately. As a result, Herradura resigned the following day, having served for five and one-half months [1, 2].

Herradura filed a claim for separation pay and unpaid salaries [3]. Perez filed a petition for consignation and declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, depositing P600.00 for the unpaid salaries [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Herradura, awarding unpaid salaries, separation pay of P400.00, P2,000.00 in moral damages, and attorney's fees [4]. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision but reduced moral damages to P1,000.00 and deleted attorney's fees [4]. Perez appealed, arguing Herradura was not entitled to separation pay because he rendered service for less than six months [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an employee who has rendered service for less than six months is entitled to separation pay under Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787.
2. W/N the award of moral damages for the non-payment of salaries is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787, an employee dismissed without just cause is entitled to *at least* one month advance notice or one month separation pay, regardless of the length of service [5]. While the law provides for a computation based on years of service (half-month pay for every year), this applies only if the result exceeds the minimum one-month requirement [5]. Since no just cause was proven for Herradura's termination, he is entitled to the minimum one month's pay despite working for only five and one-half months [5, 6].

2. **NO.** Moral damages in breaches of contract may only be awarded where the breach was wanton, deliberately injurious, fraudulent, or in bad faith [6]. The Court found no evidence that the non-payment of Herradura's salary was malicious or fraudulent [6]. The CA's reliance on Herradura's suffering and poverty was insufficient ground for the award [6].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, eliminating the award of moral damages [7].
