I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CABAGEL MACATEMBAL, G.R. Nos. L-17486-88, February 27, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On August 30, 1953, a passenger jeepney driven by Florencio Hernandez was ambushed at Kilometer 95, Sayre National Highway, Cotabato. Appellant Cabagel Macatembal signaled the jeep to stop. As the vehicle slowed down, shots were fired from multiple directions. Macatembal approached passenger Patrolman Enrique Oagdan, struck him with a bolo, shot him in the thigh, and took his gun, badge, and insignia. Two passengers, Avelino Hernandez and Mene Bagia, were killed, while Oagdan and the driver were seriously wounded. Macatembal was identified by Oagdan, who recognized him as a former detention prisoner.

The Court of First Instance of Cotabato convicted Macatembal of (1) double murder, (2) frustrated murder, and (3) assault upon an agent of a person in authority with frustrated murder. Macatembal appealed, claiming his identity was not sufficiently proven and interposing the defense of alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the penalty imposed for the complex crime of assault upon an agent of authority with frustrated murder was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the guilt of the accused was established beyond reasonable doubt. The positive identification by Patrolman Oagdan, who knew the accused previously, overcame the defense of alibi and alleged inconsistencies in testimony [1]. The crimes were qualified by treachery due to the suddenness of the attack and the use of firearms [2].

2. **NO.** The Lower Court's penalty required modification. The offense of assault upon an agent of authority with frustrated murder constitutes a complex crime. Under **Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code**, the penalty for the most serious crime (frustrated murder) must be imposed in its **maximum degree** [3]. Consequently, the Court sentenced the accused for this specific charge to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal* [3].

The Court further emphasized that under **Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code**, the maximum period of imprisonment for the successive service of sentences shall not exceed forty (40) years [3].

**Disposition:** Judgment **AFFIRMED** with **MODIFICATION** as to the penalty.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bautista Angelo, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Paredes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred [4].
