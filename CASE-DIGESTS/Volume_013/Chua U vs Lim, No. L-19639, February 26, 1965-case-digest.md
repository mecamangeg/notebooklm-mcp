I. CAPTION
CHUA U, ET AL. v. HON. MANUEL LIM, ETC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19639, February 26, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are owners and operators of Bijon factories that use rice and corn as principal ingredients [1]. Following the passage of Republic Act No. 3018 (Rice and Corn Nationalization Law) in 1960, the Rice and Corn Board (RICOB) was created to implement the Act [1]. Upon inquiry by the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce, the RICOB ruled on January 3, 1961, that the processing of rice and corn, including the manufacture of bijon, fell within the scope of R.A. 3018 [2].

Petitioners filed a petition for declaratory relief with a prayer for preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan [3]. The CFI ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring that R.A. 3018 did not cover bijon manufacturers and making the injunction permanent [3]. The RICOB appealed directly to the Supreme Court on points of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for declaratory relief should be dismissed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and dismissed the petition for declaratory relief on several grounds.

First, the petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Once the RICOB issued its ruling covering the petitioners, they should have appealed to the Board's administrative superiors before seeking judicial intervention. The Court held that a declaratory judgment is proper only if adequate relief is not available through other forms of action or proceedings, and courts will not interfere prematurely with administrative proceedings [4].

Second, the petition failed to include necessary parties. The judgment would necessarily affect other processors of rice and corn derivatives (e.g., *gaw-gaw*, face powder) who were not represented in the proceedings [5].

Third, an action for declaratory judgment must be brought before any breach of the statute or ordinance sought to be tested (Rule 66, Sec. 2) [5].

Finally, even if the action were proper, the stipulated facts were insufficient to warrant a verdict. Since the purpose of R.A. 3018 is to prevent aliens from hoarding or cornering the market to dictate prices, it was necessary to determine if producers of derivatives could create artificial scarcity [6]. The record lacked data on the consumption capacity of these producers [7].

The judgment under appeal is **REVERSED**, and the action for declaratory judgment is **DISMISSED** [7].
