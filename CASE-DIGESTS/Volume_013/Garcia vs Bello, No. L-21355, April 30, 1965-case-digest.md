I. CAPTION
BENJAMINA GARCIA, ANATALIA GARCIA, FABIAN GARCIA and VICENTE GARCIA v. HON. ELOY B. BELLO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, and PEDRO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-21355, April 30, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On October 18, 1918, respondent Pedro de Guzman instituted land registration proceedings, resulting in the issuance of an Original Certificate of Title in his favor on July 18, 1923 [1]. Decades later, on March 24, 1959, petitioners (the Garcias) filed a civil case for reconveyance against De Guzman, alleging that his registration was based on a fraudulent deed of donation from their father [1, 2]. This civil case was dismissed, a ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court on August 30, 1962 [3].

Subsequently, De Guzman moved for a writ of possession in the original land registration case, which respondent Judge Bello granted on February 2, 1963 [3]. Petitioners filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition to restrain the enforcement of the writ, arguing that the decision in the land registration case was not binding on them as they were not parties thereto and had allegedly taken possession of the land only after the rendition of said decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the decision in the land registration case is binding upon the petitioners.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a land registration case is a proceeding *in rem*, and accordingly, the decision therein rendered is binding upon the whole world, citing *Soroñgon v. Makalintal* [2].

The Court further noted that the petitioners' theory of fraud had already been disproved in the prior civil case, as their father lived for 32 years after the execution of the deed of donation without seeking to annul it or opposing the registration [4]. Additionally, the petitioners' claim of possessing the land only *after* the registration decision was refuted by their own complaint in the previous civil case, where they alleged possession *prior to* the institution of the registration proceedings [4]. Thus, the decree of registration bars their claim.

The petition is dismissed [5].
