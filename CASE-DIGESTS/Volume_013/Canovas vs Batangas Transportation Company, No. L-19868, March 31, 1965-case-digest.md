I. CAPTION
IGMIDIO CANOVAS v. BATANGAS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY and SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-19868, March 31, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Igmidio Canovas, an employee of respondent Batangas Transportation Company, was injured and hospitalized from January 21, 1961, to June 19, 1961 [1]. On February 5, 1962, he filed a petition with the Social Security Commission claiming sickness benefits under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1161 (Social Security Law) [1].

Respondent Batangas Transportation Company opposed the claim, stating it had already paid his medical expenses and Workmen's Compensation [1]. Respondent Social Security System (SSS) moved to dismiss the petition for lack of cause of action, arguing that Canovas failed to allege he was "unemployed" or a "voluntary member," which are requisites for SSS liability under the law [1]. Commissioner Manuel A. Concordia dismissed the petition with respect to the SSS [2]. Canovas appealed, arguing that the term "unemployed" in the statute should cover instances where an employee is not actually working due to illness [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the SSS is liable for sickness benefits to a member who remains employed during his illness.
2. W/N the appeal from the order of a single Social Security Commissioner is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The SSS is not liable. Under Section 14 of R.A. 1161, the SSS pays sickness benefits only if the claimant is "unemployed or is a voluntary member" [3]. Since Canovas admitted he was still an employee of Batangas Transportation Company, the SSS is not liable; in such cases, the liability falls on the employer [3]. The Court held that the term "unemployed" refers to those separated from employment and does not include employees who are merely not working due to illness [4]. The law allows separated employees to continue membership voluntarily, at which point they would be covered by the SSS as "unemployed" or "voluntary" members [5].

2. **NO.** The appeal is premature. Under Section 5(c) of R.A. 1161, appeals may be taken from the decision of "the Commission," which is a body composed of the Secretary of Labor and six members [5]. Therefore, appeals must be taken from the decision of the Commission *en banc*, not from the ruling of a single Commissioner [5].

The appeal was dismissed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bengzon, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Paredes, Bengzon, J.P., and Zaldivar concurred [6]. Justices Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal took no part [6].
