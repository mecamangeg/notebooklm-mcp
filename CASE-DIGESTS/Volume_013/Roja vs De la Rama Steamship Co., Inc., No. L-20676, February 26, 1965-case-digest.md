I. CAPTION
ACTING COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS TEOTIMO ROJA v. DE LA RAMA STEAMSHIP CO., INC. and HON. FEDERICO C. ALIKPALA, G.R. No. L-20676, February 26, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent De la Rama Steamship Co., Inc. operated the foreign vessel s/s "Mentor," which was seized by Petitioner Acting Collector of Customs of Manila for conveying unmanifested cargo [1]. The vessel was released upon a bond, but the Collector subsequently imposed a P30,000 administrative fine [1, 2]. De la Rama protested the fine, but the Collector reaffirmed the decision after a scheduled hearing where De la Rama's counsel failed to appear [2]. De la Rama filed a notice of appeal to the Commissioner of Customs, but the Collector refused to give it due course, citing a ruling that fines must be paid before an appeal is allowed [2]. Instead of pursuing the administrative matter, De la Rama filed a case with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by Respondent Judge Alikpala, seeking to annul the fine and enjoin its enforcement [2, 3]. The CFI issued a preliminary injunction [4]. The Collector moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing the matter fell under the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [4]. The CFI denied the motion, prompting the Collector to file a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to review the decision of the Collector of Customs and enjoin the enforcement of the fine.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of Customs authorities [5]. Under Republic Act No. 1125 and the Customs and Tariff Code (R.A. 1937), the jurisdiction to review fines imposed upon vessels is vested in the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [5, 6]. The Supreme Court ruled that CFI interference with Customs decisions, even through petitions for mandamus or certiorari, is prohibited [7].

Furthermore, De la Rama failed to exhaust administrative remedies [8]. The proper recourse was to appeal to the Commissioner of Customs, who has the power to review decisions of the Collector under Section 1380 of the Administrative Code [8]. The Collector's refusal to give due course to the appeal should have been raised with the Commissioner, not the CFI [8]. By bypassing the Commissioner and the CTA, De la Rama attempted to sidetrack the regular course of appeal provided by law [8].

The writs of certiorari and prohibition are granted; the CFI is directed to refrain from proceeding with the case, and the preliminary injunction is set aside [9].
