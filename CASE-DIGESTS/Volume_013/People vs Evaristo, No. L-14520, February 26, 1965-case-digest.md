I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO EVARISTO, PEDRO CARDEÑO, and AGUSTIN MIANO, G.R. No. L-14520, February 26, 1965, Paredes, J.**

II. FACTS
On November 4, 1947, in Bobon, Samar, Mayor Francisco Evaristo and Chief of Police Pedro Cardeño organized a roadblock to intercept Pastor Moyot, a political rival whom Evaristo declared an "obstacle to [his] administration." Evaristo instructed his policemen to shoot Moyot upon arrival. When the bus carrying Moyot stopped, Cardeño and Evaristo ordered the police to fire. Accused Agustin Miano and one Marcial Giray (deceased) shot and killed Moyot. No weapon was found on the victim's body.

The Court of First Instance of Samar convicted Evaristo, Cardeño, and Miano of murder, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*. Miano appealed claiming self-defense and defense of a stranger, alleging Moyot had a pistol. Evaristo and Cardeño claimed alibi and political persecution. Pending appeal, the appellants moved for a new trial based on "newly discovered evidence," including affidavits and a police blotter. Miano died during the pendency of the appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N appellant Miano proved self-defense or defense of a stranger.
2. W/N appellants Evaristo and Cardeño are guilty as co-principals by induction.
3. W/N a new trial should be granted based on the alleged newly discovered evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Having admitted to firing the fatal shots, the burden of proof shifted to Miano to prove his defense by clear and positive evidence (*People v. Ansoyon*). The Court found the claim that Moyot had a pistol to be fabricated, as reliable eyewitnesses testified that no weapon was found on the victim immediately after the shooting. The defense failed to produce the alleged pistol or the receipts for its turnover, and the testimony regarding the struggle was deemed implausible.

2. **YES.** Reliable eyewitnesses positively identified Evaristo and Cardeño ordering the shooting. The Court ruled that their alibis and claims of political persecution could not prevail over positive identification. The delay in the prosecution witnesses coming forward was satisfactorily explained by their fear of the appellants, who were powerful local officials holding the administration "up and down."

3. **NO.** The Court denied the motion for a new trial because the evidence offered (affidavits, police blotter, ante-mortem statement) was either "forgotten evidence" available at trial or merely impeaching/corroborative in nature. To grant a new trial, evidence must be discovered *after* trial, not discoverable by diligence during trial, and of such weight that it would change the judgment. Forgotten evidence is not a ground for a new trial (*People v. Penesa*).

**Disposition:** Sentence **AFFIRMED** with respect to Francisco Evaristo and Pedro Cardeño. Case **DISMISSED** with respect to Agustin Miano due to his death.
