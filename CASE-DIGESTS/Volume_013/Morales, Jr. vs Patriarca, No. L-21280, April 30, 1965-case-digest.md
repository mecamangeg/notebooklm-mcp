I. CAPTION
PROCOPIO R. MORALES, JR. v. TORIANO PATRIARCA and THE HON. JUAN R. LIWAG, G.R. No. L-21280, April 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Morales was appointed *ad interim* Justice of the Peace of San Andres, Quezon, in November 1961, assuming office on December 28, 1961 [1]. On January 27, 1962, the Secretary of Justice advised him to vacate the office, declaring his appointment without effect pursuant to Administrative Order No. 2 and the *Aytona* ruling [2]. Morales sought reconsideration on February 26, 1962, which the Secretary of Justice denied on April 3, 1962 [2].

Subsequently, Respondent Patriarca was appointed to the same position and assumed office on October 26, 1962 [3]. On May 13, 1963—more than a year after the denial of his motion for reconsideration—Morales filed a petition for "Quo Warranto, Prohibition, Injunction, Etc." with the Supreme Court, seeking reinstatement [3]. Morales argued that the one-year prescriptive period should be counted from the date his successor assumed office [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for reinstatement was filed on time.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.

The Court held that an action for reinstatement to public office, whether through *quo warranto* or *mandamus*, must be filed within one year from the date of removal or separation [5]. This period is non-extendible and runs even during the pendency of a motion for reconsideration at the administrative level [6].

In this case, the Petitioner's removal occurred, at the latest, on April 3, 1962, when the Department Head denied his motion for reconsideration [6]. Since the petition was filed on May 13, 1963, a period of 1 year, 1 month, and 10 days had elapsed, barring the action [6]. The Court rejected the argument that the period should run from the successor's assumption of office, explaining that the rationale for the one-year period is to resolve title to public office speedily, and thus the period runs even if no successor has been appointed [4].

Petition dismissed [7].
