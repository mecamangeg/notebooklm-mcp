I. CAPTION
ALEXANDER HOWDEN & CO., LTD., H. G. CHESTER & OTHERS, ET AL. v. THE COLLECTOR (NOW COMMISSIONER) OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-19392, April 14, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1950, Commonwealth Insurance Co., a domestic corporation, entered into reinsurance contracts with 32 British insurance companies not engaged in business in the Philippines, represented by petitioner Alexander Howden & Co., Ltd. [1]. The contracts were signed by the foreign reinsurers in England and subsequently signed by Commonwealth Insurance Co. in Manila [1]. In 1951, Commonwealth remitted P798,297.47 in reinsurance premiums to Alexander Howden and paid P66,112.00 in income tax on behalf of the foreign reinsurers [2]. Alexander Howden filed a claim for refund, invoking a 1953 Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling that exempted such premiums from withholding tax [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the claim, ruling that the premiums were subject to tax [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing the income was derived from sources outside the Philippines and that reinsurance premiums are not subject to withholding tax [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N reinsurance premiums remitted by a domestic corporation to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines constitute income from sources within the Philippines subject to income tax.
2. W/N said reinsurance premiums are subject to withholding tax under Sections 53 and 54 of the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 24 of the Tax Code subjects non-resident foreign corporations to tax on income from sources within the Philippines [4]. The source of income is the property, activity, or service that produced it [5]. Here, the activity producing the premiums was the undertaking to indemnify Commonwealth against liability, which took place in the Philippines where the risks and liabilities were situated [5]. Furthermore, the reinsurance contracts were perfected in the Philippines, as Commonwealth Insurance Co. signed them last in Manila [5].

2. **YES.** Section 53(b) subjects "premiums" to withholding tax [6]. Since the law does not qualify the term, it includes all premiums constituting income, whether insurance or reinsurance [7]. Even assuming they do not fall under "premiums," they constitute "determinable and periodical income" subject to withholding under the same section [7]. They are determinable because they can be accurately calculated based on the contracts, and periodical because they are earned and remitted from time to time [8]. The administrative rulings relied upon by petitioners were merely opinions in letters to taxpayers, not published regulations, and thus could not establish a binding legislative re-enactment [9, 10].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [11].
