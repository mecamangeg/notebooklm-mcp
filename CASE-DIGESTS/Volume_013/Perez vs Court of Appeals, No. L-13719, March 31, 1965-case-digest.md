I. CAPTION
FILEMON PEREZ v. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13719, March 31, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On January 15, 1949, at around 5:30 A.M., complainant Isidoro Macasero went to the house of petitioner Filemon Perez to retrieve two mirrors. When Perez opened the door, he immediately struck Macasero on the left eyebrow with a wooden rod. As Macasero ran away, Perez chased him and struck him again on the back of the head [1]. The Municipal Court of Cebu City found Perez guilty of slight physical injuries, sentencing him to 10 days of *arresto menor* [2]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance appreciated the aggravating circumstance of treachery, increased the penalty to 21 days, and awarded actual, moral, and exemplary damages [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but reduced the amount of damages [2]. Perez petitioned for review, questioning the credibility of witnesses and the findings of the lower courts [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N treachery attended the commission of the crime.
2. W/N the award of exemplary damages is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that treachery was not present. Although the attack was sudden and unexpected, the accused had just been aroused from sleep when he attacked the victim. This indicates that he did not plan or make preparations to hurt the victim in a manner that would insure the commission of the crime without risk to himself [4, 5]. The decision to strike was made on the spur of the moment, triggered by the annoyance of being awakened at an early hour [5]. The Court cited *People v. Namit* and *People v. Delgado*, ruling that mere suddenness of an attack is insufficient to constitute treachery absent proof that the mode of attack was knowingly intended to insure the accomplishment of the criminal purpose [5].

2. **NO.** Under Article 2230 of the Civil Code, exemplary damages in criminal offenses may be imposed only when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances [4, 6]. Since the Court found that there was no treachery nor any other aggravating circumstance, the accused cannot be made to pay exemplary damages [6]. However, moral damages are recoverable under Article 2219(1) for criminal offenses resulting in physical injuries [6].

The petition is **GRANTED IN PART**. The decision is **MODIFIED**; the penalty is reduced to eleven (11) days of *arresto menor* and the accused is ordered to pay P50.00 as moral damages [7].
