I. CAPTION
PACIFIC OXYGEN & ACETYLENE CO. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-17708, April 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pacific Oxygen & Acetylene Co. is a domestic corporation manufacturing acetylene and oxygen [1]. For its production, it used calcium carbide purchased from Maria Cristina Chemical Industries, a tax-exempt industry under R.A. No. 901, through its agent, National Carbon Philippines, Inc. [1, 2]. In computing percentage taxes for the years 1954 to 1956, Petitioner deducted the cost of the calcium carbide from its gross selling price [1, 3]. Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) disallowed the deduction and assessed deficiency taxes amounting to P5,855.07 [3]. The CIR also filed a counterclaim for P364.02, representing an amount an internal revenue agent had mistakenly credited to Petitioner as an overpayment [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained the assessment and granted the counterclaim [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that National Carbon Philippines, Inc. should be treated as the seller who paid taxes, and that the deduction should be allowed under Section 186-A of the Tax Code [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the cost of tax-exempt raw materials (calcium carbide) is deductible from the gross selling price for percentage tax purposes.
2. W/N Section 186-A of the Tax Code applies retroactively to the deficiency taxes in question.
3. W/N the Government is estopped by the mistake of its agent regarding the erroneous tax credit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The proviso in Section 186 of the Internal Revenue Code allows the deduction of the cost of raw materials only if they are "likewise subject to tax" under the same section or Section 189 [6]. Since the calcium carbide was produced by a tax-exempt industry and had not been previously taxed, its cost cannot be deducted from the gross selling price (*Tan Chiu v. The Collector of Internal Revenue*) [7]. The Court also found that National Carbon Philippines, Inc. merely acted as an agent, and there was no proof that percentage taxes were included in the purchase price [7].

2. **NO.** Section 186-A, which allows the deduction of the value of tax-free products utilized in manufacture, was introduced by Republic Act No. 2025, approved on June 22, 1957 [5]. The deficiency taxes assessed covered the years 1954, 1955, and 1956 [1]. Tax laws operate prospectively unless legislative intent for retroactivity is expressly declared or implied; no such intent appears in this statute (*Lorenzo v. Posadas*) [4, 5].

3. **NO.** The investigating agent had no authority to credit an alleged overpayment without a written claim filed by the taxpayer within the two-year period prescribed by Section 309 of the Tax Code [4]. The mistake of an agent does not place the Government in estoppel nor preclude it from correcting the error upon discovery (*Pineda v. Court of First Instance of Tayabas*; *Genato Commercial Corporation v. Court of Tax Appeals*) [4].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [8].
