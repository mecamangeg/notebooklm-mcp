I. CAPTION
SOLEDAD L. DE MIRAFLORES v. JOSE Y. HILADO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16601, March 24, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Y. Hilado acquired sugar quota rights adhered to Victorias Milling Co., Inc. as contingent attorney's fees. He sold one-half of these rights to Cirilo Abrasia and the other half to Soledad L. De Miraflores. Abrasia subsequently sold his share to De Miraflores as well. When De Miraflores presented the deeds of sale to Victorias Milling Co. for registration, the milling company refused because the vendors (Hilado and Abrasia) had not registered their rights with the Register of Deeds as required by Executive Order No. 873.

De Miraflores filed a complaint for specific performance and damages to compel the vendors to perfect their rights so she could register the transfer. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action, ruling that the contracts of sale did not explicitly obligate the defendants to effect the registration of the transfer in the milling company's records.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the vendors are obligated to perform the acts necessary to effect the registration of the sugar quota transfer despite the absence of an express stipulation in the contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the vendors of sugar quotas are duty-bound under their contracts of sale to do everything requisite and necessary for the registration of the transfer of said quotas to the vendee in the books and records of the sugar central concerned [1, 2]. Even without an express stipulation, the vendors must facilitate the registration because, without it, the vendee's rights would be jeopardized [2]. Consequently, the complaint alleged a sufficient cause of action against the defendants.

The order appealed from is set aside and the record of the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [3].
