I. CAPTION
ISABELO ASTRAQUILLO and JUANITA J. ASTRAQUILLO v. PRIMITIVO JAVIER, AMPARO S. JAVIER, COURT OF APPEALS, and JUDGE NICASIO YATCO, G.R. No. L-20034, January 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Astraquillo lost Civil Case No. Q-2276 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, which declared a real estate mortgage void and ordered them to vacate the subject premises and pay Respondents Javier substantial sums in rentals and damages [1-3]. While Petitioners’ appeal was pending, Respondents filed a motion for execution pending appeal alleging Petitioners’ insolvency [4]. The CFI granted the motion on October 28, 1961, citing Petitioners' admission of financial need, the accumulating back rentals, and the risk of the judgment becoming nugatory [5, 6]. The CFI allowed a stay of execution upon filing a P20,000.00 supersedeas bond, which Petitioners failed to post [6, 7].

Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA). Initially, the CA granted the petition and annulled the writ of execution. However, upon Respondents' motion for reconsideration, the CA reversed its original decision and upheld the CFI's special order of execution [8, 9]. Petitioners then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CA abused its discretion in reversing itself and that insolvency was not proven [10, 11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals acted with grave abuse of discretion in reversing its original decision.
2. W/N the execution pending appeal was justified by the insolvency of the petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that it is one of the inherent powers of a court "to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice" under Section 5, Rule 135 of the Revised Rules of Court [12]. This power includes the right of the court to reverse itself, especially when, in its honest opinion, it has committed an error that would cause injustice to a litigant [12].

2. **YES.** The power to grant execution pending appeal is discretionary, and appellate courts will not interfere absent an abuse of discretion [13]. The Court affirmed that the insolvency of the defeated party is a "good and special reason" for immediate execution [14]. Insolvency need not be proved directly but may be inferred from circumstances appearing of record [15]. Here, the record showed Petitioners owed roughly P18,000 in back rentals, admitted a need for funds, possessed only household effects for levy, and failed to file the required supersedeas bond [16, 17].

**Petition dismissed.** [15]
