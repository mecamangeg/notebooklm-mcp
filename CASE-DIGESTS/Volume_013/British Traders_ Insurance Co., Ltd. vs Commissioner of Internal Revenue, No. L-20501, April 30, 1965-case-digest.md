I. CAPTION
BRITISH TRADERS’ INSURANCE CO., LTD. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-20501, April 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner British Traders’ Insurance Co., Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation doing business in the Philippines, entered into reinsurance treaties with foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines. While the treaties were negotiated and signed abroad (London) and payment was stipulated there, petitioner was required to keep a register in Manila. Entry of risks in this register constituted a binding cession to the reinsurers.

For 1954 and 1955, petitioner ceded reinsurance premiums but did not withhold income tax, claiming the income was from sources outside the Philippines. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed withholding taxes, which the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained. Before the CTA decision became final, petitioner belatedly filed income tax returns and paid the 1954 tax, then moved to file a supplemental petition for review to claim relief from the withholding tax. The CTA denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines pursuant to treaties executed abroad are subject to Philippine withholding tax.
2. W/N the CTA erred in denying the admission of the supplemental petition for review.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The reinsurance premiums are subject to withholding tax. The taxability of a foreign corporation’s income depends on the locus of the activity, property, or service giving rise thereto [1]. While the contract was signed abroad, the vital activity—the entry of risks in the register which made the cession binding—was performed in the Philippines [2]. Under Sections 53 and 54 of the Tax Code, the place of activity, not the place of business, is controlling [3]. Additionally, the State is not estopped from collecting taxes by the errors of its agents regarding previous rulings [4].

2. **NO.** The admission of a supplemental pleading lies within the sound discretion of the court [5]. Admitting the petition would have reopened the case and effectively forced the CTA to perform the audit and verification functions properly belonging to the BIR [6]. Furthermore, allowing the supplement would permit the petitioner to conveniently change its theory after an adverse judgment [7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED.
