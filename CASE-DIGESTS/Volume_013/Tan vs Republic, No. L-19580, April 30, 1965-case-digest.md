I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF FELIX TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. FELIX TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19580, April 30, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Felix Tan, a single Chinese subject born in Dumaguete City, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He was employed as a salesman at Sin Chu Huat Store, earning P1,560 in 1958, P1,680 in 1959, and P1,740 in 1960, which amounts to a monthly average of approximately P145.00, plus free board and lodging valued at P50.00 per month [2, 3]. He owned no real estate [1]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granted the petition, finding that Tan possessed all the qualifications for citizenship [4]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed, arguing that Tan failed to satisfy the requirement of having a lucrative trade or profession [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, ruling that the petitioner's employment was not "lucrative" [6, 7]. The Court defined lucrative employment as not merely sufficient for ordinary necessities, but one that provides an "appreciable margin of his income over his expenses" to ensure adequate support in events like unemployment or sickness, preventing the individual from becoming a public charge [6].

Given the high cost of living and low purchasing power of the currency at the time, the Court held that a monthly income of P145.00, even with free board and lodging (totaling roughly P195.00), does not meet the standard [6, 8]. The Court relied on recent jurisprudence, specifically *Koh Chet v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-17223) and *Albert Ong Lin Chuan v. Republic* (L-18550), where applicants earning P200.00 a month were denied citizenship for lack of a lucrative trade [9, 10].

Consequently, the decision appealed is **REVERSED** and the petition for admission to Philippine citizenship is **DENIED** [7].
