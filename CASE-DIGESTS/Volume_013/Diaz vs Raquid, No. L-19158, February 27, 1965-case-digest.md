I. CAPTION
CIRIACO C. DIAZ v. EUTIQUIO RAQUID, et al., G.R. No. L-19158, February 27, 1965, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ciriaco C. Diaz was appointed as Head Parks and Game Warden in July 1957 upon the effectivity of the Government Reorganization Plan. At the time, he held a civil service eligibility of "Ranger" (Second Grade). Under the Appropriation Acts for fiscal years 1960-1961 (R.A. 2700) and 1961-1962 (R.A. 3100), his position was allocated to WAPCO Range 45 with a higher annual salary. However, Respondent Eutiquio Raquid, the Auditor for the Parks and Wildlife Office, refused to authorize the payment of the full salary fixed by the Appropriation Acts. Raquid relied on Section 9 of R.A. 2260 (New Civil Service Act, enacted June 19, 1959), which imposed a maximum salary cap for Second Grade eligibles that was lower than the amount allocated to Diaz in the Appropriation Acts. Diaz filed an original petition for mandamus with the Supreme Court to compel the payment of his full salary.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 9 of R.A. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959) may be applied retroactively to reduce the salary of a permanent incumbent whose position was classified prior to the Act's effectivity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Section 9 of R.A. 2260 cannot be given retroactive effect to deprive the petitioner of any portion of his compensation. Section 47 of the same Act explicitly provides that rights or privileges fixed or acquired under the Old Civil Service Law prior to the effectivity of the new Act shall remain in full force and effect [1].

Diaz was already a permanent incumbent when R.A. 2260 was enacted in 1959, having been appointed and his position reclassified under the Reorganization Pay Plan in July 1957 [1]. Consequently, the salary limits based on eligibility under Section 9 of R.A. 2260 cannot affect him adversely. The provisions of the Appropriation Acts, which fixed his salary within the WAPCO range, control the matter of his compensation [2].

Petition is **GRANTED**. Respondents are ordered to pay petitioner’s salary as fixed in the Appropriation Act [2].
