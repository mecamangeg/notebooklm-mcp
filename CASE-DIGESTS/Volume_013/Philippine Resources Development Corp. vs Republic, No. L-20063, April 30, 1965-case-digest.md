I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, MACARIO APOSTOL and EMPIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20063, April 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed a suit against Macario Apostol and Empire Insurance Company [1]. Philippine Resources Development Corporation (PRDC) filed a complaint in intervention, claiming rights over goods allegedly disposed of by Apostol, its corporate president, to the Bureau of Prisons without PRDC's consent [2]. The Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint in intervention [1]. On March 31, 1965, the Supreme Court modified the judgment, setting aside the dismissal only as against Apostol and ordering him to return the properties or pay PRDC [3]. PRDC filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that it should also be entitled to recover from the Republic [4]. PRDC contended that the Republic was not immune from suit because it performed proprietary functions and had allegedly appropriated the goods in question [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint in intervention constitutes a suit against the Republic of the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that PRDC's suit in intervention was directed against Apostol, not the Republic [2]. A review of the record showed that the Republic did not assert an adverse interest over PRDC's goods; rather, it was Apostol who clearly asserted such interest [2]. The Republic's defenses in its answer were merely hypothetical—stating that "if" goods were delivered, the Bureau of Prisons did not know they belonged to PRDC—and did not constitute an admission of appropriation [5]. Furthermore, the fact that the Republic sued Apostol to collect a specific amount indicated that it refused to credit the goods in Apostol's favor [6]. Since the suit was not directed against the State, the arguments regarding the waiver of state immunity due to proprietary functions were inapplicable [2].

The Motion for Reconsideration was **DENIED** [7].
