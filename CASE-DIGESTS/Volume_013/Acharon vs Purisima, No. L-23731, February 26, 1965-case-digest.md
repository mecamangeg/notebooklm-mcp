I. CAPTION
PEDRO ACHARON v. FIDEL P. PURISIMA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23731, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro Acharon was charged with four counts of violating Commonwealth Act No. 303 before the Municipal Court of General Santos, Cotabato, presided by Respondent Judge Fidel Purisima [2, 3]. Acharon filed a motion to quash on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that administrative remedies under the Minimum Wage Law had not been exhausted and the requisite certification from the Secretary of Labor was missing [3]. The Municipal Court denied the motion to quash [3].

Acharon filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato [3]. The CFI dismissed the petition because Acharon failed to incorporate the criminal informations and the order denying the motion to quash into his petition, leaving the court unable to determine the merits [4]. Instead of filing a motion for reconsideration to submit the missing pleadings, Acharon appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N certiorari is the proper remedy against the denial of a motion to quash. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that when a motion to quash a criminal case is denied, the remedy is not to file a petition for certiorari but to go to trial without prejudice to reiterating the special defenses invoked in the motion [5]. If an adverse decision is rendered after the trial on the merits, the accused may then appeal in the manner authorized by law [5].

Furthermore, the Court ruled the appeal lacked merit because the technical defect in the CFI (failure to attach pleadings) should have been remedied by a motion for reconsideration furnishing the necessary documents, rather than an appeal [5].

**Appeal dismissed.** [6]
