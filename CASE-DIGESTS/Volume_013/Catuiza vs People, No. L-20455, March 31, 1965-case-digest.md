I. CAPTION
NAZARIO CATUIZA v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and the HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20455, March 31, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On August 10, 1957, petitioner Nazario Catuiza was driving Halili Transit bus No. 606 in Nueva Ecija. While attempting to overtake another bus (No. 187) at high speed, Catuiza swerved to the left lane and collided with a jeepney coming from the opposite direction. The collision resulted in the death of eight persons and serious injuries to two others [1, 2].

The Court of First Instance convicted Catuiza of multiple homicide with multiple serious physical injuries through reckless negligence. The court sentenced him to imprisonment and ordered him to indemnify the victims' heirs, including an award of P1,000.00 for the damages to the jeep of the deceased Pedro Pagdanganan [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3]. Catuiza appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the inclusion of property damages not charged in the information, and arguing that insurance proceeds received by the heirs should be deducted from the civil liability [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the award of damages for the destruction of the jeep is proper even if the information did not charge damages to property.
2. W/N proceeds from life insurance policies received by the heirs should be deducted from the civil liability under Article 2207 of the Civil Code.
3. W/N the absence of malice or the alleged contributory negligence (overloading) of the victims mitigates the petitioner's liability.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The award for damages to the property (jeep) was erroneous because the information merely charged multiple homicide and physical injuries. It did not allege that the acts of the accused resulted in damages to property. An accused cannot be convicted of and sentenced for something with which he is not charged [5].

2. **NO.** Article 2207 of the Civil Code, which allows for subrogation of the insurer to the rights of the insured, refers specifically to damages to "property." Under the principle of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, the specific reference to property excludes all other damages, such as those resulting from loss of life or injury to natural persons [6]. Unlike property insurance, which aims to reimburse loss, that is not the sole object of life insurance [6].

3. **NO.** In cases of homicide through reckless negligence, the absence of malice is the very essence of the crime charged and cannot serve as a mitigating circumstance [7]. Furthermore, the alleged overloading of the jeep did not contribute to the collision, and the passengers could not have contributed to the occurrence of the accident [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION**, reducing the indemnity to the heirs of Pedro Pagdanganan by P1,000.00 (the value of the jeep) [8].
