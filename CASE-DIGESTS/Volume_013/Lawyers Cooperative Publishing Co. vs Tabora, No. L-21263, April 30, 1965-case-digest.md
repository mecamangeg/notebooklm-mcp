I. CAPTION
LAWYERS COOPERATIVE PUBLISHING COMPANY v. PERFECTO A. TABORA, G.R. No. L-21263, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 3, 1955, Perfecto A. Tabora purchased a set of *American Jurisprudence* from Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company for P1,682.40, paying a down payment of P300.00. The contract provided that "title to and ownership of the books shall remain with the seller until the purchase price shall have been fully paid" but that "loss or damage to the books after delivery to the buyer shall be borne by the buyer" [1]. The books were delivered to Tabora's law office in Naga City on May 15, 1955 [2]. That same night, a fire destroyed the building, burning the books and Tabora's documents [2]. Tabora failed to pay the monthly installments, prompting the company to sue for the balance [2]. Tabora argued that since ownership remained with the seller and the loss was due to *force majeure*, he should not be liable [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the company, ordering Tabora to pay the balance plus 25% liquidated damages [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the buyer bears the loss of the goods destroyed by *force majeure* even if ownership was retained by the seller.
2. W/N the buyer is liable for liquidated damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the general rule is that the owner bears the loss (*res perit domino*), this case falls under the exception provided by the contract and the law. The Court held that the stipulation retaining ownership was merely to secure the performance of the buyer's obligation [5]. Furthermore, the contract expressly agreed that loss after delivery would be borne by the buyer [5]. This is sanctioned by Article 1504 of the Civil Code, which states that goods are at the buyer's risk from the time of delivery when ownership is retained merely to secure performance [6]. Additionally, the defense of *force majeure* to extinguish liability under Article 1262 applies only to the delivery of a determinate thing; here, the obligation is pecuniary in nature, and the obligor explicitly assumed the risk of loss [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Tabora should not be made to pay liquidated damages because his refusal to pay the balance was based on a legal defense and not due to bad faith [8].

The decision appealed from is MODIFIED by eliminating the award of liquidated damages, but affirmed as to the payment of the balance [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
J.B.L. Reyes, J., concurred in the result [9].
