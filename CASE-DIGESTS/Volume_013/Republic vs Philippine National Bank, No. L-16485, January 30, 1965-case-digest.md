I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-16485, January 30, 1965, 13 SCRA 24, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In July 1947, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), an instrumentality of the petitioner Republic, opened a current account with respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB). On December 27, 1949, PNB negligently paid P37,553.32 to an unnamed person based on two checks with fictitious payees and forged signatures [1]. The AFP discovered the error and demanded a refund on April 15, 1950, but PNB refused.

On November 6, 1959, the Republic filed a suit to recover the amount. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint upon PNB's motion, presumably on the ground of prescription given the time lapse [1]. The Republic appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic's action is barred by the statute of limitations (prescription).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the statute of limitations does not run against the State [2, 3]. The AFP is an instrumentality of the Republic exercising **constituent functions**—those compulsory and essential to sovereignty, such as the preservation of the State and national security—as distinguished from ministrant or optional functions [4]. Citing *Bacani vs. National Coconut Corporation*, the Court emphasized that the Republic is the proper party-plaintiff and, absent any showing that the deposit was made other than in its capacity as a sovereign instrumentality, the plea of prescription cannot be maintained [3, 4]. While PNB has a separate legal personality and proprietary functions, the plaintiff here is the State itself acting through the AFP [5].

The order appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [3].
