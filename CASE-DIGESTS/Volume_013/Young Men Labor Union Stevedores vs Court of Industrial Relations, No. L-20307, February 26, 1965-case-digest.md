I. CAPTION
YOUNG MEN LABOR UNION STEVEDORES v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20307, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Nasipit Lumber Company, Inc. (NALCO) entered into a 50-50 stevedoring contract with two rival unions, Young Men Labor Union Stevedores (YMLUS) and Victory Stevedoring and Labor Union (VISLU). YMLUS later demanded NALCO withdraw VISLU’s share, alleging VISLU’s registration permit had been cancelled. When VISLU refused to yield, YMLUS threatened and carried out picketing, resulting in bloody incidents between the rival groups. NALCO filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to enjoin the violence and determine which union should handle the work. Although both unions initially filed motions to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction, they subsequently withdrew them and submitted to the CIR's jurisdiction. The CIR ordered the parties to observe the 50-50 status quo until a certification election could determine the proper bargaining agent. YMLUS appealed, challenging the CIR's jurisdiction and the order for an election.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the controversy and the authority to order a certification election.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that under **Section 12(b) of Republic Act No. 875**, matters pertaining to certification elections involving two or more unions belong to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations. The Court emphasized that certification proceedings are investigatory in nature, entrusted to the CIR, and the Supreme Court will not interfere with the CIR's judgment absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion (*Benguet Consolidated, Inc. v. Bobok Lumber Jack Association*). Furthermore, the petitioner was **estopped** from questioning the jurisdiction of the lower court because it had voluntarily withdrawn its motion to dismiss and submitted its evidence (*Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Company*). The CIR's order maintaining the 50-50 arrangement pending the election and prohibiting illegal picketing acts was proper to prevent further violence.

The order appealed from is affirmed.
