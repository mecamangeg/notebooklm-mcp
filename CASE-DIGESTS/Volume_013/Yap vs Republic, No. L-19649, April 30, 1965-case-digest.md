I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LUIS YAP FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LUIS YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19649, April 30, 1965, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Luis Yap, a single individual, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. The Republic appealed the decision, arguing that Yap failed to prove he had a lucrative employment. At the time of the hearing in December 1961, Yap was employed as a teacher at the Samantabhadra Institute in Cebu City with a stated monthly salary of P200.00. However, the evidence showed he was only paid during the 10-month school year (June to March), resulting in an actual annual income of P2,000.00, or approximately P166.00 per month. Yap argued that despite this income, he lived with a cousin in Cebu and received free board and lodging in exchange for tutoring his cousin's children.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's annual income of P2,000.00, with free board and lodging, constitutes a lucrative income sufficient for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found the Solicitor General's contention meritorious and reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that an annual income of P2,000.00 (or roughly P166.00 a month) is not considered lucrative, even for a single applicant receiving free board and lodging.

In making this determination, the Court considered the prevailing high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the Philippine currency. Relying on recent jurisprudence, specifically *Alberto Ong Lin Chuan vs. Republic* (G.R. No. L-18550) and *Koh Chet vs. Republic* (G.R. No. L-17223), the Court reiterated that a monthly salary of P200.00, even with free board and lodging, does not satisfy the statutory requirement for lucrative income. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition is denied.
