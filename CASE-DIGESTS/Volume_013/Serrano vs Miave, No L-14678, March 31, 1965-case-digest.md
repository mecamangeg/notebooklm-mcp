I. CAPTION
JUAN SERRANO v. FEDERICO MIAVE, EUGENIA HIDALGO MIAVE and CRESENTE VICTORINO, G.R. No. L-14678, March 31, 1965, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On February 6, 1956, Juan Serrano and Spouses Miave verbally agreed on the sale of a truck and a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC). The spouses delivered the truck and CPC to Serrano on February 10, 1956. Serrano later sued for specific performance to compel the execution of a formal deed of sale. On February 15, 1957, the parties entered into a compromise agreement fixed at P5,200, where Serrano would deliver a jeepney and pay installments, while the spouses would execute the deed and cooperate in the CPC transfer. The trial court approved this compromise on February 24, 1957.

Serrano failed to deliver the jeepney, leading the spouses to move for execution. The Sheriff levied on Serrano’s *own* separate CPC and sold it to the spouses, who later sold it to Cresente Victorino. Serrano then filed a suit to annul the compromise and execution, alleging fraud and lack of consideration because he discovered the spouses' CPC had been cancelled by the Public Service Commission (PSC) as early as October 1956. The lower court ruled in favor of Serrano, annulling the proceedings. The defendants appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the compromise agreement is void for fraud due to the alleged concealment of the CPC's cancellation.
2. W/N the compromise agreement is void for lack of consideration given the CPC's revocation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judgment upon a compromise has the effect of *res judicata*, and while it may be set aside for vitiated consent such as fraud under Art. 2038 of the Civil Code, fraud was not proven in this case. Serrano had possession of the truck and the certificate since February 10, 1956, giving him ample opportunity to investigate its status at the PSC [1]. As a CPC holder himself, he should have been aware of PSC requirements and his failure to effect the transfer immediately was due to his own inaction [2, 3]. Moreover, by failing to question the validity of the compromise and the judgment in time, Serrano forfeited his right to have them set aside [4].

2. **NO.** The compromise agreement was merely a reaffirmance and ratification of the original verbal contract of February 6, 1956, without novation [4]. Under Art. 1352 of the Civil Code, the existence of consideration is necessary only at the time of the perfection of the contract [5]. Since the truck and CPC existed at the time of the original agreement, the subsequent revocation or insufficiency of the vendor's title does not constitute a lack of consideration that would render the contract void [5].

**Decision reversed *in toto*. The compromise agreement, judgment, writ of execution, and Sheriff’s sale are declared valid.**
