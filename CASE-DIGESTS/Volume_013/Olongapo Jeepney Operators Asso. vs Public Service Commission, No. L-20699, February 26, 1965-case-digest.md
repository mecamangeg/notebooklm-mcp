I. CAPTION
OLONGAPO JEEPNEY OPERATORS ASSOCIATION v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and DIOSDADO BARTOLO, G.R. No. L-20699, February 26, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Diosdado Bartolo applied for a certificate of public convenience to operate a public utility service in Olongapo, Zambales [1]. The Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an order setting the hearing for July 30, 1962, requiring that notice be sent to affected operators listed in the order at least 10 days before the hearing, and that an affidavit of mailing be submitted as proof [1]. While notice was published in newspapers, the individual notices to the affected operators (including petitioner) were posted by registered mail only on July 25, 1962—five days before the hearing [2, 3]. Consequently, the operators received the notices after the scheduled hearing date [2]. Despite the lack of an affidavit of mailing and the untimely notice, the PSC entered an order of default against the operators and rendered a decision on November 16, 1962, granting Bartolo the certificate [3, 4]. Petitioner moved to set aside the decision on the ground of lack of notice, but the motion was misplaced in the Commission's records and not acted upon, prompting this petition for review [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission validly acquired jurisdiction over the case despite the failure to strictly comply with the requirement of individual notice to affected operators.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdictional requirement of notice to affected parties was not complied with [5]. The PSC's order specifically required notice to be mailed at least 10 days before the hearing, but records showed they were mailed only 5 days prior, making it impossible for the addressees in Zambales to receive them in time [3]. Furthermore, the applicant failed to submit the required affidavit of mailing [3]. The Court ruled that the requirement of publication in newspapers is conjunctive with, and not an alternative to, the requirement of individual notice to the operators affected [6, 7]. Compliance with publication alone is insufficient [7]. Due to these deficiencies, the affected parties were deprived of their day in court.

The decision in PSC Case No. 62-3695 is SET ASIDE, and the case is REMANDED to the Commission for further proper proceedings [8].
