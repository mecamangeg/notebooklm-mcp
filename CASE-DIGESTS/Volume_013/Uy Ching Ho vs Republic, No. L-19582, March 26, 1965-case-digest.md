I. CAPTION
UY CHING HO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19582, March 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Uy Ching Ho, born in Amoy, China in 1914, arrived in the Philippines on February 26, 1926. He has resided in Dumaguete City since 1929, is married, and has five children [1, 2]. He is a merchant with an annual income that rose to P7,799.34 in 1960 [3]. His four school-age children are enrolled at the Dumaguete Chinese School, an institution recognized by the government but where the majority of students are Chinese or foreigners [2, 4].

In his petition for naturalization, he presented two character witnesses, Ligorio Luzada and Eleuterio Katada, who both testified that they had known the petitioner since 1940 [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granted the petition [7]. The Republic appealed, questioning the competency of the witnesses and the petitioner's qualifications [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s character witnesses were competent to establish his good conduct during his entire period of residence.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the petitioner evinced a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and mingle socially with Filipinos.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The law requires an applicant to prove proper and irreproachable conduct during the *entire* period of his residence in the Philippines [8]. Petitioner arrived in 1926, but his witnesses categorically stated they only came to know him in 1940 [8]. This 14-year gap in evidence renders the witnesses incompetent to attest to his conduct for the required period, failing to meet the legal requirement [8].

2. **NO.** An annual income of P7,799.34 for a petitioner with a wife and five children to support does not meet the requirement of a lucrative occupation, considering the high cost of living and the low value of currency [9, 10].

3. **NO.** While the Dumaguete Chinese School is recognized by the government, the fact that most students there are Chinese or foreigners, with Filipinos forming a minority, argues against the petitioner's alleged sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions and to mingle socially with Filipinos [4, 9]. The Court held that he could have enrolled his children in a school owned or run by Filipino citizens if his desire were sincere [4].

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** [11].
