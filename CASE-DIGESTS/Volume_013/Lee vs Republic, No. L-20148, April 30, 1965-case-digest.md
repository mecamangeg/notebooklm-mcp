**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. PABLO LEE alias ENG JIO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20148, April 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Pablo Lee, also known as Eng Jio, filed a petition for naturalization as a Filipino citizen. He used the alias "Eng Jio" in his application and various exhibits, though he did not show authorization for its use. To prove he had a lucrative trade or occupation, he testified that he was a graduate engineer employed by Lu Tai Lumber Co. with a stipend of P250.00 per month plus free board and lodging. However, the lumber company was owned by a partnership in which his father had an interest. Furthermore, Lee was single, lived with his parents, and owned no real property. His income tax returns covered the year 1961, which was subsequent to the filing of his application in November 1960. The Court of First Instance of Cebu (Case No. 606) granted his petition. The Republic appealed, questioning his character regarding the alias and the sufficiency of his income.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner's unauthorized use of an alias is a ground for disqualification.
2. W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of having a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The unauthorized use of aliases is disqualifying conduct. The petitioner failed to show that his use of the alias "Eng Jio" was authorized as required by the Alias Law (Commonwealth Act No. 142) [1]. The Court held that such violation of the law is not "irreproachable conduct," which is a requirement for naturalization. The Court cited *Wang I Fu v. Republic* and *Koa Gui v. Republic*, establishing that unauthorized use of an alias is a ground for denying the application [2].

2. **NO.** The Court found the petitioner's claim to a lucrative occupation dubious. While he claimed a stipend of P250.00, he was employed by a business where his father had an interest, lived with his parents, and owned no property [3]. The Court emphasized that qualifications must be possessed at the time of the application, not subsequently; notably, his income tax returns were for a period later than his application [3, 4]. Citing *Que Choc Gui v. Republic* and *Sy Ang Hoc v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that income allegedly derived from a family enterprise is often insufficient to establish compliance with the statutory requirement of a lucrative occupation [4].

WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the application for naturalization is ordered **DISMISSED**.
