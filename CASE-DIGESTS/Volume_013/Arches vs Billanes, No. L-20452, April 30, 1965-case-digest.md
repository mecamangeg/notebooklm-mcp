I. CAPTION
JOSE A. ARCHES v. AURORA BILLANES, G.R. No. L-20452, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Jose A. Arches was declared the owner of a portion of Lot No. 3150 in a 1935 CFI decision, which ordered the annotation of his interest on the title. While the annotation was made on the original Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 3906 issued to Spouses Espi and Marcelino, it was omitted on the owner’s duplicate certificate. Following the destruction of the original title during the war, the title was administratively reconstituted in 1947 based solely on the clean owner’s duplicate. Consequently, the reconstituted title and subsequent transfers, ending with respondent Aurora Billanes, did not bear Arches' annotation.

In 1959, Arches filed a petition with the CFI of Capiz to annotate his interest on the reconstituted title and all subsequent titles. Billanes opposed, arguing she purchased the property in good faith relying on the clean owner's duplicate. The lower court dismissed the petition without prejudice, ruling that the lack of annotation on the source document (owner's duplicate) made the summary petition improper given the intervening rights of third parties. Arches appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for annotation of interest in a land registration proceeding is the proper remedy to enforce a co-owner's omitted claim against a reconstituted title held by a third-party purchaser.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petition was improper. The Court reasoned that while the interest was annotated on the lost original, its omission from the owner's duplicate—upon which the administrative reconstitution and subsequent sales were based—created a controversy involving third parties.

Since respondent Billanes claims to have acquired the property in good faith and for value relying on a clean title, the issue cannot be resolved in a summary proceeding under Republic Act No. 26 (reconstitution of titles), which does not cover controversial issues. The Court ruled that the proper recourse is a separate, independent action where the parties can fully litigate and defend their respective interests.

The order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
