I. CAPTION
PAULITA L. ESTEBAN v. ANTONIO V. CAVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21361, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 1, 1959, respondent Antonio V. Cava filed a complaint for falsification of a public document against petitioner Paulita L. Esteban with the City Fiscal of Manila [1]. Esteban moved to suspend the preliminary investigation, arguing that a similar complaint filed by Cava against her before the Bureau of Civil Service constituted a prejudicial question that must be decided first [1]. When the Fiscal denied her motion, Esteban filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1, 2]. The CFI granted the petition and ordered the respondents to withhold action on the criminal complaint until the administrative charge was finally disposed of [3]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court. On February 2, 1965, appellants manifested that the administrative case had been finally decided adverse to Esteban [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the petition for prohibition was predicated mainly on the claim that the City Fiscal should be prevented from acting on the criminal charge due to the pendency of the administrative case, which allegedly involved a prejudicial question [4]. Since the administrative case has already been finally terminated, the basis for the suspension no longer exists [4]. The appeal is therefore moot and academic [4].

The appeal is dismissed [5].
