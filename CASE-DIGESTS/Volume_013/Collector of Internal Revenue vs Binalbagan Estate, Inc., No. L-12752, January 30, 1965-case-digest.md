I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. BINALBAGAN ESTATE, INC., G.R. No. L-12752, January 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Binalbagan Estate, Inc. (Binalbagan) operated a sugar central. During World War II, its books were lost. In 1945, its accountant reconstituted the records, valuing its tangible assets at P824,559.91, without valuing its sugar quota [1]. In 1946, Binalbagan merged with Isabela Sugar Co. to form BISCOM. A committee (Westly Committee) appraised Binalbagan's tangible assets at P2,541,134.69 and its sugar quota at P1,482,629.28. Based on this higher appraisal, Binalbagan received 216,000 BISCOM shares in exchange for its assets [2], [3].

In 1951, Binalbagan sold 176,945 of these shares to Philippine Planters’ Investment Co. on installment. In reporting capital gains for 1951-1953, Binalbagan erroneously used the lower 1945 book value (P824,559.91) as the acquisition cost, resulting in higher taxable income [3], [4]. The Collector assessed deficiency taxes, which Binalbagan paid under protest. Binalbagan then claimed a refund, arguing the correct cost basis was the 1946 Westly appraisal value [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Binalbagan, ordering a refund with interest [6]. The Collector appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the acquisition cost of the shares sold is the fair market value of the assets given in exchange (Westly appraisal) rather than the reconstituted book value.
2. W/N the Collector is liable to pay interest on the tax refund.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The acquisition cost is the fair market value of the assets given in exchange. The transaction where Binalbagan acquired the shares was an exchange of property (assets and sugar quota) for stock. Under Section 35(c) of the Tax Code, when one piece of property is exchanged for another, the property received is considered equivalent to the fair market value of the assets given in exchange [7], [8]. The Westly Committee appraisal represents the true fair market value at the time of exchange, which includes the value of the sugar quota, whereas the 1945 reconstituted value was an unreliable estimate [9], [10].

2. **NO.** The Government is not liable for interest on tax refunds unless the collection was attended with arbitrariness [11]. Here, the deficiency assessment was based on figures reported by Binalbagan in its own returns. The error was due to the taxpayer's mistake, not the Collector's arbitrary determination; hence, no interest is due [12].

The Order of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed with modification that the refund shall be without interest.
