I. CAPTION
HERNANDO LAYNO, ET AL. v. HON. RAFAEL DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20636, April 30, 1965, J.B.L. Reyes, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Lianga Bay Logging Co., Inc. filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao del Sur against petitioners (Layno, et al. and Young Men Labor Union Stevedores). The complaint alleged that petitioners demanded Lianga cancel its existing stevedoring contract with respondent Diatagon Arrastre Co., Inc. so that petitioners' union members could take over the loading of logs [1]. The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining petitioners from interfering with the loading operations [2, 3].

Petitioners moved to dissolve the injunction, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the case involved a "labor dispute" under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) and the procedure in Section 9 of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) was not followed [4]. They alleged the rival union was company-dominated and its permit had expired [5]. The CFI denied the motion, finding valid existing contracts [4]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the controversy constitutes a "labor dispute" under the Industrial Peace Act, thereby removing jurisdiction from the CFI.
2. W/N a mere allegation of unfair labor practice is sufficient to oust the CFI of its jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the definition of "labor dispute" in the Industrial Peace Act is confined to cases involving the exercise of freedom of action of employees regarding freedom of association and designation of bargaining representatives [7]. Here, petitioners did not demand better terms or conditions of employment, nor did they seek to represent the workers already employed. Instead, they demanded that the current workers (members of the rival union) be discharged and replaced by petitioners' members [7]. Since there was no controversy over terms, tenure, conditions of employment, or representation, the Industrial Peace Act did not apply, and the CFI retained jurisdiction [7]. The Court cited *Associated Flour Haulers v. Sullivan* and *Donnelly Garment Co. v. International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union* to support this interpretation [7].

2. **NO.** A mere charge or allegation of unfair labor practice (ULP) does not suffice to oust the jurisdiction of the CFI, especially in the absence of evidence that the acts complained of were actually committed or that a ULP charge is pending in the CIR [8]. Petitioners failed to submit evidence to the trial court to support their claims that the rival union was company-dominated or that its permit had expired [8, 9].

Petition dismissed [9].
