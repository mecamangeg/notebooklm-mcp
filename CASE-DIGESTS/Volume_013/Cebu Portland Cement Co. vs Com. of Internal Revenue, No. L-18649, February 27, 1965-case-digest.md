I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-18649, February 27, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company (CEPOC), a government-controlled corporation, produced cement and was assessed *ad valorem* taxes by the respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). The CIR based the assessment on the selling price of the cement produced, contending that since cement consists of 80% minerals, it falls under the definition of "mineral products" in Section 246 of the Tax Code [1]. CEPOC paid the taxes but sought a refund, arguing that the tax should be based on the actual market value of the quarried minerals (limestone and shale) used in production, not the finished cement [1]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the refund, upholding the CIR's interpretation [2]. Hence, this petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N *ad valorem* mining taxes should be based on the selling price of the manufactured cement.
2. W/N the claim for refund is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The *ad valorem* tax should be based on the market value of the quarried minerals, not the cement. The Court ruled that the *ad valorem* tax is imposed on the privilege of severing or extracting minerals from the earth, based on the Regalian theory of State ownership [3]. While Section 246 defines "mineral products" as things with at least 80% mineral content, this definition contemplates minerals undergoing only simple treatments (e.g., washing or cutting) that do not transform the raw material [4]. Cement is the result of a definite manufacturing process involving crushing, mixing, and calcining, resulting in a chemical change [5]. Therefore, it is a manufactured product and not a "mineral product" for *ad valorem* tax purposes. The selling price of cement cannot be used as the gauge for the market value of the minerals composing it [4].

2. **YES.** Under Section 306 of the Internal Revenue Code, actions for the recovery of taxes erroneously collected must be filed within two years from payment [6]. Since CEPOC filed the action on October 15, 1959, any overpayments made prior to October 15, 1957, are barred by prescription [6].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. Petitioner is entitled to the refund of overpayments made after October 15, 1957 [7].
