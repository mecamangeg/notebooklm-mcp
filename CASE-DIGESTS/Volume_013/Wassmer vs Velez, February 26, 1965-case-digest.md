I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ P. WASSMER v. FRANCISCO X. VELEZ, G.R. No. L-20089, February 26, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Defendant-appellant Francisco Velez filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision promulgated on December 26, 1964. The motion challenged the Court's finding regarding the "affidavit of merits" Velez had attached to his petition for relief in the lower court. Velez's affidavit stated that he had a "good and valid defense" because his failure to marry the plaintiff as scheduled was due to a "fortuitous event and/or circumstances beyond his control." Velez argued that this statement was a positive allegation of fortuitous facts and not merely a conclusion or opinion, thus satisfying the requirement for a valid affidavit of merits [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an affidavit of merits stating that the failure to marry was due to "fortuitous event and/or circumstances beyond his control" is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that an affidavit of merits must contain facts, not mere conclusions of facts or opinions [2]. An affidavit is defined as a statement under oath of facts. Velez's affidavit failed to state the specific "event" or "circumstances" constituting his defense, leaving the court to guess what the facts were [3]. A vague affidavit fails to serve its purpose, which is to allow the court to determine whether the defense is effective and if reopening the case would be a worthwhile use of the court's time (*Vda. de Yulo v. Chua Chuco*; *Vaswani v. Tarachand Bros.*) [2, 3].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [4].
