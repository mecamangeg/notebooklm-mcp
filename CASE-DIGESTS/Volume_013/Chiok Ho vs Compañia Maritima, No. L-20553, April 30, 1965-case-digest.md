I. CAPTION
CHIOK HO v. COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, ET AL. and MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20553, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
A shipment of 69 cases of radio parts, consigned to Marinduque Iron Mines, Inc. and assigned to plaintiff-appellee Chiok Ho, was discharged from the carrying vessel into the custody of the arrastre operator, defendant-appellant Manila Port Service (MPS), between May 11 and May 15, 1960 [1, 2]. The shipment was placed in the Special Cargo Corral [2]. Upon delivery to the consignee, four cases valued at P3,402.50 were found missing [1]. Chiok Ho filed provisional claims for the loss on June 13 and June 16, 1960 [2, 3].

MPS and Manila Railroad Company denied liability, invoking Section 15 of the Management Contract printed on the delivery permit and gate passes [4, 5]. This provision required claims for loss to be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the vessel [5]. MPS argued that since the last package was discharged on May 15, 1960, the claims filed in June were barred [5]. Chiok Ho contended that the shipment was delivered to him only after the 15-day period expired, making compliance impossible [3]. The parties submitted a stipulation of facts but failed to state the actual date of delivery to the consignee [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Chiok Ho, ordering defendants to pay the value of the missing goods [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the 15-day prescriptive period stipulated in the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the provision in the Management Contract limiting liability is a matter of defense [6, 7]. Therefore, the burden is on the arrastre operator to prove that all conditions for its applicability exist, specifically: (a) that the cargo was delivered within the 15-day period, (b) that the loss occurred during that period, and (c) that the consignee knew of the loss [8].

The Court emphasized that it is not enough to notify the consignee of the discharge from the vessel; the date of actual delivery is equally important so the consignee has a chance to discover any loss [9, 10]. Since the stipulation of facts was silent on when the shipment was actually delivered, and the defendants failed to prove that delivery occurred within the 15-day period, the Court presumed that the claim was filed within the reglementary period [2, 9, 10].

Decision affirmed [11].
