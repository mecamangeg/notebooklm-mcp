I. CAPTION
CATALINA CAYETANO v. OSMUNDO CEGUERRA and FELINA SERRANO, G.R. No. L-18831, January 30, 1965, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On November 15, 1960, Catalina Cayetano filed a complaint for foreclosure of real estate mortgage against spouses Osmundo Ceguerra and Felina Serrano. Within the reglementary period, the defendants, who were laymen acting without counsel, filed an answer in the form of a letter to the court. The letter admitted the loan but alleged that Cayetano prevented them from paying by refusing to surrender the title required for the release of their GSIS loan proceeds. Despite this letter-answer, the trial court declared the defendants in default for failure to file a responsive pleading and allowed Cayetano to present evidence ex-parte. The court rendered judgment in favor of Cayetano on January 11, 1961. The decision was returned unclaimed.

On April 21, 1961, the defendants received a Writ of Execution. On June 17, 1961, they filed a Petition for Relief, arguing their letter was a valid answer and they were deprived of their day in court. The trial court denied the petition, ruling it was filed beyond the 60-day period calculated from the presumed receipt of the unclaimed decision (January 13, 1961). The defendants appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a letter-answer submitted by a layman constitutes a valid responsive pleading sufficient to prevent a declaration of default.
2. W/N the petition for relief was filed within the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that a letter-answer presented by an ordinary layman, containing a recital of facts relied upon as defenses, constitutes sufficient and substantial compliance with the rules on responsive pleadings [1], [2]. The defendants' letter admitted the debt but raised the defense that the plaintiff frustrated their payment capability [3]. Having filed an answer, the defendants were entitled to notice of hearing. The trial court's failure to notify them constituted a deprivation of their day in court and a lack of due process, rendering the proceedings null [1], [2], [4]. A defendant who timely files an answer cannot be in default [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the petition for relief was filed on time. Under Section 2, Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court, a petition for relief may be taken not only from judgments but also from orders or other proceedings, including an order of execution [6], [7], [5]. The time is reckoned from when the defendants had actual knowledge of the order of execution on April 21, 1961. Since the petition was filed on June 17, 1961, only 57 days had elapsed, well within the 60-day limit [5]. Actual knowledge of the decision could not be attributed to the defendants merely through an unclaimed registry notice that did not indicate it contained the decision [6], [7], [8].

Accordingly, the orders were set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for a hearing on the merits.
