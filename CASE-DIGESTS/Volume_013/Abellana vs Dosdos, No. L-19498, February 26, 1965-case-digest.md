I. CAPTION
VICENTE ABELLANA, et al. v. HON. TERESO M. DOSDOS and CONSTANCIO ALCOBER, G.R. No. L-19498, February 26, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Damaso Abellana and his wife filed an ejectment case against spouses Constancio and Esteleta Alcober regarding a portion of land in Cebu City [1]. The Municipal Court rendered a decision on November 29, 1960, fixing a five-year lease between the parties. The judgment ordered the Alcobers to pay P30.00 annual rental during the first week of January each year; failure to pay would result in the issuance of execution to vacate the premises [2].

The judgment became final on December 22, 1960. The Alcobers failed to pay the rental for 1961 during the first week of January. On January 19, 1961, the Abellanas filed a motion for execution due to non-payment. The Alcobers deposited the amount on January 30, 1961 [3]. Respondent Judge Dosdos denied the motion for execution, finding that the delay was not voluntary but due to pending negotiations initiated by the plaintiffs for the barter of the land [4].

The Abellanas filed a petition for *mandamus* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to compel the judge to execute the decision. The CFI granted the writ, ruling that execution was a ministerial duty and applying Rule 72, Section 8 (execution pending appeal) [5]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the issuance of the writ of execution was a ministerial duty compellable by mandamus despite the occurrence of new facts after the judgment became final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the CFI.

The Court held that the CFI erred in applying Rule 72, Section 8, as the case was an original action for *mandamus* and not an appeal, and the judgment had already become final [5].

While the execution of a final judgment is generally ministerial, the Court applied the doctrine established in *Candelario v. Cañizares* and *City of Butuan v. Ortiz*: after a judgment has become final, if there is evidence of an event or circumstance which would affect or change the rights of the parties, the court should be allowed to admit evidence of such new facts and suspend execution to grant relief as warranted [6].

In this case, the Municipal Court found that the delay in payment was excusable because it resulted from barter negotiations initiated by the plaintiffs themselves [7]. Since these new facts existed and affected the rights of the parties, the duty to execute the judgment was not ministerial and could not be compelled by *mandamus* [6].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED [8].
