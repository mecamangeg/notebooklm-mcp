I. CAPTION
JOSE MA. LEDESMA v. FELIX VILLASEÑOR, G.R. No. L-18725, March 31, 1965, Makalintal, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Felix Villaseñor, acting as administrator of his deceased father's estate, filed a petition (Civil Case No. 5662) to enjoin the Register of Deeds from registering a deed of sale transferring two lots to Jose Ma. Ledesma, alleging the deed was fictitious and forged [2]. The trial court initially issued a preliminary injunction but subsequently lifted it and dismissed the petition on October 3, 1960 [2].

Two days later, Ledesma filed a petition in the separate *cadastral* record of the lots, requesting the court to order the Register of Deeds to register the sale, citing the dismissal of the civil case [3]. The court granted this request *ex parte*, without notice to Villaseñor or the Register of Deeds, leading to the cancellation of the estate's titles and the issuance of new titles to Ledesma [3]. Villaseñor moved for reconsideration, which was denied, prompting this appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court in a cadastral proceeding may validly order the registration of a deed of sale without notice to the adverse party solely because a preliminary injunction in a separate civil case was dissolved. [3], [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that while the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction in the civil case removed the obstacle for the Register of Deeds to perform his administrative duties, it did not authorize the court to order registration in the cadastral proceeding without notice to the adverse party [5].

The Court emphasized that the dismissal of the civil case challenging the validity of the sale was not yet final [5]. Furthermore, there is a distinction between the Register of Deeds registering an instrument as a ministerial duty and a court *ordering* such registration; the latter requires notice and hearing and carries the solemn consequences of a court judgment [6].

The orders appealed from were set aside [7].
