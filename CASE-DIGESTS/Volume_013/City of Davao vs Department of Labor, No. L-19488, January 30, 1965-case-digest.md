I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF DAVAO v. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR and HEIRS OF ISAAC ABEQUIBIL, G.R. No. L-19488, January 30, 1965, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Isaac Abequibil, a laborer in the City Engineer’s Office of Davao, died. His widow filed a claim for benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation Act (WCA) with Regional Office No. 8 of the Department of Labor [1-3]. The City of Davao moved to dismiss the claim, arguing that the Regional Office lacked jurisdiction because Section 699 of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) had repealed the WCA provisions regarding government employees, and that paying WCA benefits would constitute double compensation as they had already paid allowances under the RAC [3]. The Regional Office denied the motion to dismiss [4].

The City filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao, alleging lack of jurisdiction [4]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the laws were not in conflict and that *certiorari* was not the proper remedy as appeal was available [4, 5]. The City appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Regional Office of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction over the workmen's compensation claim, rendering the petition for *certiorari* improper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Regional Office of the Department of Labor has jurisdiction to adjudicate workmen's compensation claims [7]. The Supreme Court held that *certiorari* is a remedy intended solely to keep an inferior court within its jurisdiction; thus, only jurisdictional matters or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction may be averred [8].

The City's argument that the Revised Administrative Code repealed Section 3 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act is a question of law (statutory construction), not a question of jurisdiction [7, 8]. Citing *San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v. Sobremesana*, *La Mallorca v. Ramos*, and *Madrigal Shipping Co. v. Melad*, the Court reaffirmed the validity of Reorganization Plan 20-A and the jurisdiction of labor regional offices over such claims [7]. Since the Regional Office acted within its jurisdiction, the petition for *certiorari* was correctly dismissed.

**Decision affirmed.**
