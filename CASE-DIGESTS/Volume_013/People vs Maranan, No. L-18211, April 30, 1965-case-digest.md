I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAYMUNDO MARANAN, AGAPITO TORANO, and DOMINADOR GALARIO, G.R. No. L-18211, April 30, 1965, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On December 5, 1959, at about 8:00 p.m., appellants Raymundo Maranan, Agapito Torano, and Dominador Galario entered the bakery and grocery store of Tan Hoc in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro [1]. Pretending to buy cigarettes, they drew pistols and a knife, tied up Tan Hoc and his companion Tan Guat, and ransacked the premises for money and valuables [1], [2]. The appellants assaulted the victims, resulting in the death of Tan Guat due to multiple stab wounds and serious physical injuries to Tan Hoc [2]. The appellants were identified by Tan Hoc and a witness who saw them loitering nearby; additionally, they executed extrajudicial confessions, and Galario led police to his share of the loot [3], [4]. The Court of First Instance convicted them of robbery in band with homicide and serious physical injuries, imposing the death penalty for the former and a separate indeterminate sentence for the latter [5]. The appellants appealed, relying primarily on the defense of alibi [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in rejecting the defense of alibi.
2. W/N the accused can be convicted of two separate crimes (robbery with homicide and physical injuries) arising from the same incident.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the alibis unworthy of credence as they were contradicted by positive identification and physical evidence [6], [7]. Torano's claim of detention for drunkenness was not supported by the police blotter [6]. Galario admitted participation and led authorities to the stolen money, while Maranan’s alibi was not supported by credible testimony [7], [8]. The trial judge’s assessment of witness credibility was accorded respect [8].

2. **NO.** The appellants committed only one crime, not two. Under Article 294, subdivision (1) of the Revised Penal Code, the offense is classified as the special complex crime of robbery with homicide [9]. The physical injuries sustained by the surviving victim are absorbed in this single offense [9]. Consequently, the separate penalty for physical injuries was eliminated [10]. Due to the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling, and aid of armed men (and recidivism for Maranan), the maximum penalty of death was proper [9].

*Decision affirmed with modification.*
