I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. NESTORA EUFRACIA SONG SIONG HAY UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19845, February 26, 1965, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Nestora Eufracia Song Siong Hay Uy filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision on behalf of the Republic [2]. The undisputed facts established that the petitioner earns an annual income of P1,440.00, or P120.00 per month, with free board and lodging [3]. The appeal focused on whether this income level met the requirement of a lucrative trade or occupation [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that considering the increase in the cost of living, a monthly income of P120.00, even when coupled with free board and lodging, is patently insufficient to be considered lucrative for purposes of naturalization [3, 4]. While the Court had previously ruled in *Lim vs. Republic* (1953) that a salary of P80.00 plus board and lodging was sufficient, it clarified that subsequent decisions have effectively reversed that ruling due to the considerable rise in living costs, citing cases such as *Ong Ling Chuan vs. Republic* and *Koh Chet vs. Republic* [3]. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [5].
