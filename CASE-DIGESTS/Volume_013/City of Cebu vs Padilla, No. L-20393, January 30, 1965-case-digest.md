I. CAPTION
CITY OF CEBU v. EMILIO PADILLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20393, January 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Juan Padilla filed a homestead application for Lot No. 3986 in Cebu City in 1939, which was approved in 1949 [1]. In 1952, the Director of Lands ordered the issuance of a homestead patent in his favor [1]. Juan died and was succeeded by respondents Emilio and Alberto Padilla [2]. Meanwhile, the City of Cebu held a gratuitous permit over a portion of the land for a slaughterhouse project, which it sought to reserve for its exclusive use [3, 4]. The Padillas successfully petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the issuance of the patent [5]. The City filed a complaint to annul the mandamus judgment and the patent order, but the Court of First Instance dismissed it [5]. The City appealed to the Court of Appeals [6]. Pending appeal, the parties entered into an agreement where the City withdrew its objection to the patent, provided that sites for a city abattoir, street extension, and river channelization were excluded for its use [6, 7]. The Solicitor General did not object but noted that the City could not automatically obtain title to the excluded public land [8]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the compromise agreement excluding specific sites from the homestead patent for the City's use should be confirmed.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court approved the agreement and ordered the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources to exclude the sites for the proposed city abattoir, street extension, and river channelization from the homestead patent to be issued to the Padillas [9].

However, the Court clarified that the City does not automatically acquire title to the excluded portions. Under **Section 83 of the Public Land Law**, before a city can be granted exclusive use of a portion of the public domain, it must secure a **proclamation by the President of the Philippines** withdrawing said land from sale or settlement and reserving it for the city's use [10, 11]. The confirmation of the agreement merely paves the way for the Chief Executive to reserve the segregated sites [12].

The order of dismissal was set aside and the Motion for Confirmation of Agreement was granted [9].
