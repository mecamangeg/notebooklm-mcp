I. CAPTION
CAPT. J. ANTONIO M. CARPIO, ET AL. v. HON. MACARIO PERALTA, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-20093, March 31, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were reserve officers in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) with five or more years of service. A Board of Officers, created by the Chief of Staff pursuant to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2334, selected them for retention in the active service for one year. Despite this selection, the Chief of Staff issued warning orders and radiograms directing the reversion of petitioners and other reserve officers to inactive status.

Petitioners filed a class suit in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to enjoin the Secretary of National Defense and the Chief of Staff from reverting them, arguing that under R.A. No. 2334, their selection by the Board was final and exempted them from reversion. The trial court initially issued a preliminary injunction but later rendered a decision dismissing the petition and cancelling the injunction. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the selection of reserve officers for retention by the Board of Officers under R.A. No. 2334 is final and binding on the President and the AFP Chief of Staff.
2. W/N the reverted officers are entitled to "enjoyed leave" of absence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The selection by the Board of Officers is merely recommendatory and not binding on the President or the AFP superiors. The Court held that nothing in Section 3 of R.A. No. 2334 implies that the Board's selection is final or conclusive. Under Section 79(c) of the Revised Administrative Code, Department Heads have direct control and supervision over their jurisdiction, subject to the President's control under Section 74. Furthermore, Section 22(m) of the National Defense Act (Commonwealth Act No. 1) empowers the President to order reserve officers to active duty "at any time and for any period," which implies the discretion to order their reversion. R.A. No. 2334 merely removes selected officers from the operation of *mandatory* reversion but does not repeal the President's basic authority to revert officers to inactive status at any time [1-3].

2. **NO.** Petitioners are not entitled to "enjoyed leave" (remaining on active duty to consume leave). Under Section 286 of the Revised Administrative Code, they are only entitled to the total vacation and sick leaves accumulated/accrued in their favor, which they can collect in cash upon reversion. They are also entitled to the gratuity provided by R.A. No. 2334 [4].

The order of the lower court is AFFIRMED with modification.
