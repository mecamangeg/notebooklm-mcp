I. CAPTION
MARIA A. GAYACAO v. THE HON. EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, HON. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS and FELIXBERTO ALCARMEN, G.R. No. L-21060, April 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 3, 1935, petitioner Maria Gayacao filed Miscellaneous Sales Application No. 8558 for two residential lots in Basilan City. She paid the required installments, improved the land, and maintained possession. After World War II, she allowed respondent Felixberto Alcarmen to temporarily occupy part of the property. However, Alcarmen subsequently filed his own sales application for one of the lots. In 1949, the Director of Lands approved Alcarmen's application and excluded the lot from Gayacao's application, a decision affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Executive Secretary.

Gayacao filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Basilan City to annul these administrative decisions. The public respondents moved to dismiss, arguing that under the Judiciary Act and cases like *Acosta v. Alvendia*, the CFI lacked jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari or mandamus against officials whose offices were outside its territorial jurisdiction. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance of Basilan City has jurisdiction to review the administrative decisions of national officials holding office in Manila.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. The Court held that the power of judicial review over administrative decisions arises from the doctrine of supremacy of law and the courts' inherent authority to enforce constitutional rights, such as due process [1].

The Court distinguished this case from *Acosta v. Alvendia* and *Samar Mining Co. v. Arnado*, which involved writs of injunction seeking to control acts by officers outside the court's territorial jurisdiction. In this case, the remedy sought was the review and annulment of a decision based on alleged errors of law [1]-[2]. To confine this power solely to the courts where the national officials maintain their offices would result in hardship to litigants of limited means and unnecessarily encumber Manila courts. Citing *Ortua v. Singson*, the Court affirmed that the power of provincial courts to review administrative decisions of national officials has been consistently recognized [3].

The order of dismissal was reversed and set aside, and the records were remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [4].
