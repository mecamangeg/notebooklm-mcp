**I. CAPTION**
GENERAL INSURANCE AND SURETY CORPORATION v. LEANDRO E. CASTELO and JOSEFA PAYUMO CASTELO, G.R. No. L-19330, April 30, 1965, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 22, 1959, petitioner General Insurance and Surety Corporation filed an ejectment suit in the Municipal Court of Quezon City against respondent spouses Castelo regarding a lot at No. 34 Bulusan, Quezon City. Petitioner claimed ownership of the lot. In their answer, respondents denied petitioner's ownership, asserting they were the true owners and that petitioner only held title as a trustee or under an equitable mortgage [1, 2].

The Municipal Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the issue hinged on ownership, which is not cognizable by an inferior court. Petitioner appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Quezon City. Respondents moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction. While the CFI initially denied the motion, it ultimately dismissed the case on February 2, 1961, concluding that it could not exercise jurisdiction because the respondents had registered an "insistent objection to the exercise of original jurisdiction" from the beginning [3-5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to try the case despite the Municipal Court's lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal.

The Court held that the Municipal Court correctly dismissed the ejectment case because the resolution of the dispute hinged on a question of ownership, evidenced by both parties asserting title over the property [6, 7].

Regarding the CFI's jurisdiction, the Court applied Section 11 of Rule 40 of the Rules of Court. This rule provides that when a case is tried by an inferior court without jurisdiction, the CFI may try the case on the merits in the exercise of its **original jurisdiction**, provided the parties file pleadings and go to trial **"without any objection to such jurisdiction"** [7].

In this case, the respondents did not waive their right to object. On the contrary, they were "vigorous and insistent" in objecting to the CFI's exercise of jurisdiction, filing a motion to dismiss and a motion for reconsideration immediately upon appeal [8]. Citing *Rivera v. Halili*, the Court ruled that the condition for the CFI to assume original jurisdiction was not met because of the respondents' express objection [9].

The decision appealed from was affirmed [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
**Dizon, J.** (Concurring):
Justice Dizon added that because the plaintiff's claim for possession rested entirely on a disputed instrument (alleged deed of sale vs. equitable mortgage), the question of title had to be adjudicated first. This necessity defeated the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, making the dismissal proper [11].
