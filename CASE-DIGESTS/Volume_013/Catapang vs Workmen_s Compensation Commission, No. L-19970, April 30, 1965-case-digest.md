I. CAPTION
**FEDERICO CATAPANG vs. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC.**, G.R. No. L-19970, April 30, 1965, Paredes, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Federico Catapang was employed by respondent Victorias Milling Co. starting in 1934 and rejoined in 1946 as an "Issuer of Foodstuffs" [3]. In 1948, he was diagnosed with minimal pulmonary tuberculosis but continued working until June 23, 1951, when he was hospitalized for "far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis" and completely incapacitated for work [3]. On September 30, 1951, upon the company physician's recommendation, he was dismissed [3, 4].

Catapang filed a claim for compensation. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) denied the claim, ruling that under Act 3428 (the law in force at the time of disability in 1951), employees earning more than P42.00 a week were excluded from coverage [5]. The WCC noted that Catapang was earning P200.00 a month (approx. P46.15/week) at the time of his separation in September 1951 [6]. However, records showed Catapang earned P170.00 a month until June 1, 1951, when his salary was raised to P200.00 just weeks before his hospitalization [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s average weekly wage should be computed based on the salary earned during the 12 weeks preceding his disability, thereby bringing him within the coverage of the Workmen's Compensation Act. [2, 9]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC decision. The Court ruled that under Section 19 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the average weekly wage is computed based on the "twelve weeks next preceding his injury" [10]. In this case, the date of disability was June 23, 1951, when Catapang was hospitalized and incapacitated [4].

Counting 12 weeks back from June 23, 1951, the period covers March 31 to June 23, during which Catapang earned P170.00 a month until the increase on June 1 [4]. Computed over this 12-week period, his average weekly wage was P39.23, which is below the statutory limit of P42.00 existing at the time [4, 9]. The Court further held that the salary increase and subsequent discharge appeared to be timed to defeat the petitioner’s right to compensation "in the guise of generosity and benevolence" [11, 12].

Petition is **GRANTED**. The decision is reversed, and Victorias Milling Company is ordered to pay compensation and attorney's fees [12].
