I. CAPTION
FELISA TAYAO, ET AL. v. PASCUALA DULAY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21160, April 30, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Apolonio Tayao executed a deed of sale with option to repurchase (*pacto de retro*) in favor of Pascuala Dulay covering a parcel of land for P138.79 [1]. The contract expressly stipulated that the land could not be repurchased during the first ten years following the execution of the sale, but did not specify a deadline for repurchase thereafter [1]. Plaintiffs-appellants (Tayao's successors) argued that this clause was contrary to law, rendering the contract a mere evidence of indebtedness [1]. Defendants-appellees claimed the transaction was a valid sale and that ownership had consolidated in Dulay due to the failure to repurchase, after which she sold the property to her co-defendants [2]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the stipulation prohibiting repurchase for ten years converts the *pacto de retro* sale into a mere evidence of indebtedness.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The fact that the stipulation is contrary to law does not convert the contract into a mere evidence of indebtedness or a mortgage [3]. The contract remains a valid *pacto de retro* sale, subject to the statutory limits on redemption [3].

Relying on *Santos v. Heirs of Crisostomo*, the Court held that a stipulation prohibiting the exercise of the right to repurchase for ten years is illicit because it suppresses the right during the period when the law allows it to be exercised [4, 5]. Under Article 1508 of the Spanish Civil Code, the period for repurchase cannot exceed ten years [3]. The effect of the illicit stipulation is not to void the sale, but to allow the right of repurchase to be exercised at any time within the ten-year statutory limit [6]. Since neither the plaintiffs nor their predecessor exercised the right within ten years from the date of the contract, the title consolidated in the defendants [7].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
