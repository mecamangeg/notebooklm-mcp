I. CAPTION
ALFREDO BOLLOZOS v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16441, March 31, 1965, 13 SCRA 469, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo Bollozos operated a mechanical repair shop in Cebu City from 1950 to 1955. While he paid the fixed annual tax (except for 1952), the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) discovered on November 29, 1955, that he failed to pay the percentage taxes imposed by Section 191 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Assessments were sent to Bollozos in 1955 and 1956, but he failed to pay. A warrant of distraint and levy was issued in 1958 but was not executed due to a request for reinvestigation. After the assessment became final, Bollozos filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in January 1959. He admitted his tax liability but raised the defense of prescription, arguing that under the presumption of law (Sec. 5[ff], Rule 131), he is deemed to have filed his returns, making the five-year prescriptive period under Section 331 applicable. The CTA ruled against him, finding that he failed to file returns and ordered him to pay the deficiency.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's right to collect the deficiency taxes has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the CTA's decision, holding that the right to collect had not prescribed.

The Court rejected the petitioner's reliance on the legal presumption that "the law has been obeyed" (that he filed his returns). While a taxpayer is generally entitled to this presumption, it does not apply when compliance is squarely and explicitly challenged. Once questioned, the burden of proof shifts to the taxpayer to prove compliance. Bollozos offered no proof that he filed the returns, and the CTA explicitly found that he failed to do so (except for two quarters in 1950).

Consequently, the applicable provision is Section 332(a) of the Tax Code, not Section 331. Section 332(a) provides that in cases of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed or a proceeding in court for collection may be begun within **ten years** after the discovery of the omission. Since the omission was discovered on November 29, 1955, the Collector had until November 29, 1965, to collect. The respondent’s answer to the petition for review, filed on March 13, 1959, is considered equivalent to a court proceeding to collect. Thus, the action was instituted well within the ten-year prescriptive period.

The petition is denied and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
