I. CAPTION
RECAREDO B. CASTILLO, et al. v. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS, SURIGAO DEL SUR, et al., G.R. No. L-22765 (with G.R. No. L-24038), January 30, 1965, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 12, 1963 general elections, Recaredo B. Castillo and other candidates (petitioners) filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao del Sur to compel the Provincial and Municipal Boards of Canvassers to recount votes. Petitioners alleged that election returns were dictated by armed bands and that votes were fraudulently read for their opponents [1].

On December 9, 1963, the CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the irregularity was not proven, the petition failed to specify material figures, and the action was improperly directed against the boards of canvassers who lack authority to recount votes [2]. Since no preliminary injunction was issued, the canvass proceeded. The winning candidates were proclaimed on December 14, 1963, and took their oaths of office on January 1, 1964 [2].

Petitioners appealed the CFI's dismissal to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-22765) [2]. Meanwhile, Castillo filed an election protest (Civil Case No. 26) in the CFI. He later filed a separate petition for mandamus (G.R. No. L-24038) to compel the CFI Judge to proceed with the revision of ballots in the election protest, which the Judge had suspended pending the resolution of the appeal in G.R. No. L-22765 [3], [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the dismissal of the petition for recount has become moot and academic due to the proclamation of the winning candidates.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal is moot and academic.

The Court reasoned that since the proclamation of the winners had been made and the officials had already assumed office, the remedy of a recount or pre-proclamation controversy is no longer available [3]. The proper remedy left to the petitioners is to contest the election, which petitioner Castillo had already done by filing an election protest (Civil Case No. 26) [3]. The Court ruled that its authority to review is limited to live, justiciable issues, and the main purpose of the original petition could no longer be served [3], [4]. Consequently, the appeal in G.R. No. L-22765 and the petition for mandamus in G.R. No. L-24038 were both dismissed [5].

Appeal and petition dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
