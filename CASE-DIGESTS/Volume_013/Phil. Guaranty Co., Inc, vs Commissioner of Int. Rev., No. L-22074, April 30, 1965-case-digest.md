**I. CAPTION**
THE PHILIPPINE GUARANTY CO., INC., petitioner, vs. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, respondents, G.R. No. L-22074, April 30, 1965, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
The Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc., a domestic insurance company, entered into reinsurance contracts with various foreign insurance companies not doing business in the Philippines. Under these contracts, the petitioner ceded to the foreign reinsurers a portion of premiums on insurance originally underwritten in the Philippines. The contracts were generally signed in Manila or contained stipulations invoking Philippine law, and the petitioner managed the reinsurance affairs in Manila [1, 2].

For the years 1953 and 1954, the petitioner excluded these ceded premiums from its gross income and did not withhold or pay tax on them, relying on previous rulings of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). The CIR subsequently assessed withholding taxes on the ceded reinsurance premiums. The petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, which upheld the assessment [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N reinsurance premiums ceded to foreign reinsurers not doing business in the Philippines are subject to Philippine income tax and withholding tax.
2. W/N the government is estopped from collecting the tax due to the petitioner's reliance on previous CIR rulings.
3. W/N the withholding tax should be computed on the total amount ceded or only on the amount actually remitted.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The reinsurance premiums are corporate income from sources within the Philippines and are subject to tax under Section 24 of the Tax Code [5]. The word "sources" refers to the activity, property, or service giving rise to the income. Here, the activity creating the income—the undertaking to reinsure risks in the Philippines—was performed in the Philippines [5]. The Court held that Section 24 does not require a foreign corporation to engage in business in the Philippines to be taxed; it suffices that the **activity** creating the income is performed here. The place of activity, not the place of business, is controlling [6]. Section 37 of the Tax Code is not an all-inclusive enumeration of income from Philippine sources [7].

2. **NO.** The government is not estopped from collecting taxes by the mistakes or errors of its agents [8]. While reliance in good faith on the CIR's rulings may free the taxpayer from surcharges or penalties, it does not exculpate them from the liability to pay the tax itself [9].

3. **TOTAL AMOUNT CEDED.** The withholding tax must be computed on the total amount ceded. Sections 53 and 54 of the Tax Code allow no deduction from the income enumerated therein for the purpose of withholding. Therefore, the tax applies to the gross amount of premiums ceded, regardless of the amount actually remitted to the foreign reinsurers [10, 11].

**Decision affirmed.** The petitioner is ordered to pay the total amount of P375,345.00 as withholding tax for the years 1953 and 1954 [11].
