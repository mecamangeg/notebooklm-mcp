I. CAPTION
EDGARDO R. HOJILLA v. HON. SALVADOR L. MARIÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20574, February 26, 1965, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Edgardo R. Hojilla, a first-grade civil service eligible, was appointed Chairman of the Board of Special Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration on March 24, 1953, pursuant to Section 27(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 613 [1]. His appointment contained a specific proviso that it could be terminated at any time, "without any proceedings," at the pleasure of the President of the Philippines [1]. The position was later classified by WAPCO as Hearing Officer II [1]. On January 23, 1962, the President terminated his services effective immediately [2]. Hojilla sought reconsideration, arguing that as a civil service eligible exercising quasi-judicial powers, he had security of tenure and could not be removed without cause and due process [2, 3]. After his plea was rejected, he filed a petition for *quo warranto* directly with the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's termination was valid despite his civil service eligibility and the quasi-judicial nature of his functions.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner's appointment was validly terminated.

The Court ruled that the petitioner's appointment was *in essence* temporary because it was issued pursuant to Section 27(a) of Commonwealth Act No. 613, which makes the appointee "removable at pleasure," and contained an express proviso that it was terminable at any time without proceedings [4]. A temporary appointment does not provide a definite tenure of office and is dependent upon the pleasure of the appointing power; thus, it can be terminated at a moment's notice without the need to show cause [4].

The Court further held that:
1.  **Civil Service Eligibility:** Possession of civil service eligibility does not protect a temporary appointee from removal at pleasure. Having accepted a temporary appointment, the petitioner cannot invoke the security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution [5].
2.  **Nature of Functions:** The claim that the petitioner exercises quasi-judicial powers is of no moment. Security of tenure is characterized by the nature of the appointment, not the nature of the duties or functions [6].
3.  **WAPCO Classification:** The Reorganization Act of 1954 authorizing WAPCO to classify positions did not authorize the change of the nature of appointments from temporary to permanent [7].

Accordingly, the petition was **DISMISSED** [8].
