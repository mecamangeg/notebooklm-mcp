I. CAPTION
KOPPEL (PHIL.), INC. v. AURELIO JAVELLANA, SR. and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19926, April 30, 1965, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Aurelio Javellana, Sr. was employed by petitioner Koppel (Phil.), Inc. as a salesman starting March 22, 1954. His duties involved traveling over rugged, dusty roads, waking up as early as 3:00 a.m., and driving a company truck, which caused significant physical strain. In November 1956, he spat blood and was confined at the Quezon Institute for tuberculosis. He resumed work shortly after discharge. On April 21, 1958, he suffered injuries when the company truck he was driving fell into a ravine due to brake failure. He returned to work in May 1958, but an X-ray on November 6, 1958, revealed his tuberculosis was active and far advanced. Javellana filed a compensation claim. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ordered Koppel to pay P4,000.00 minus P2,098.00 in previous payments. Koppel appealed, questioning the compensability of the illness and seeking the deduction of an additional P1,237.50 paid to Javellana under an agreement treating it as an advance on compensation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N respondent's illness is compensable due to aggravation by employment.
2. W/N the amount of P1,237.50 paid as "retirement pay" should be deducted from the compensation award.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 2 of Act No. 3428, an employer is liable if an employee's illness is aggravated by the nature of their employment. The Court found that Javellana's pre-existing minimal tuberculosis was aggravated by the physical strain of his work and the vehicular accident [1, 2]. Evidence showed his condition worsened from minimal to far advanced during the course of employment and notably regressed to a moderately advanced stage only after he retired [2].

2. **YES.** While the voucher for the P1,237.50 payment referred to it as "retirement pay," the parties executed an "Agreement and Release" stipulating that this sum would be considered an advance against any future workmen's compensation award [3]. This agreement is valid and does not violate Section 7 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, as it does not exempt the employer from liability but merely credits voluntary payments against the final award [4]. Additionally, the Court corrected a prior deduction calculation from P1,098.00 to P1,199.00 [5].

The decision is **MODIFIED**. The sums of P1,199.00 and P1,237.50 are deducted from the P4,000.00 award, leaving a balance of P1,563.50 to be paid by petitioner to respondent.
