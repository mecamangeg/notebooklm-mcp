I. CAPTION
FILOMENA SALAS v. FLORA QUINGA, G.R. No. L-20294, January 30, 1965, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Filomena Salas filed an action for reconveyance of a parcel of land against defendant Flora Quinga, administratrix of the estate of Ceferino Datoon [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo dismissed the complaint and ruled in favor of Quinga [2]. Pending Salas’ appeal, Quinga obtained a writ of execution in 1951 and took possession of the land from the receiver [2]. Subsequently, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI decision, ordering Quinga to execute a deed of reconveyance to Salas and to deliver material possession of the lot as well as "all the funds which the receiver may have in his hands" [3]. This reversal was affirmed by the Supreme Court [4].

Upon remand, Quinga executed the deed of reconveyance but refused to turn over the products of the land, arguing that the CA decision did not expressly mention the return of such products and that the land and products had already been distributed to the heirs [4, 5]. The CFI overruled her objections and ordered the restoration of the products. Quinga appealed directly to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Quinga is liable to restore the products of the land received during execution pending appeal despite the appellate judgment not expressly specifying such restitution.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that by obtaining a writ of execution pending appeal and taking possession of the land, Quinga replaced the receiver for all legal purposes in the collection of its produce [7]. Therefore, the CA decree ordering the delivery of possession and funds in the receiver's hands applies to her as if she were the receiver proper [7].

Furthermore, the appellate court did not need to specify restitution in its judgment. Under **Rule 39, Section 5 of the Rules of Court**, when an executed judgment is reversed on appeal, the trial court may issue orders of restitution as equity and justice warrant [8]. This rule applies absent any contrary disposition in the final judgment [9]. Finally, Quinga cannot use the distribution of assets to the heirs as a defense; as administratrix, she knew of the pending appeal and was duty-bound to reserve the land and products. She is personally answerable for her failure to do so [5].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [10].
