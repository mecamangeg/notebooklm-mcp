I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23082, April 29, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On February 18, 1964, the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) filed a petition for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) regarding the supervisory personnel of La Carlota Sugar Central [1]. The CIR granted the petition but PAFLU moved for reconsideration to include a list of laborers omitted by oversight [2]. While the motion was pending, the Director of Labor scheduled the election for June 29, 1964 [3]. PAFLU filed an urgent motion to suspend the election until the voter list was corrected, but the CIR could not act on it due to a lack of quorum [3]. Consequently, PAFLU filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court to stop the election [4]. The Court gave due course to the petition but declined to issue the writ of preliminary injunction [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for being academic and lacking a justiciable controversy [5]. The certification election sought to be suspended was scheduled for June 29, 1964 [5]. Since the Court refused to issue the injunction prayed for, and nearly two years had elapsed since the scheduled date, there was every reason to believe that the election had already been held as scheduled [5].

Petition dismissed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, and Sanchez concurred [5]. Justices J.P. Bengzon and Zaldivar took no part [5].
