I. CAPTION
FELICIDAD TOLENTINO v. EULOGIA BIGORNIA CARDENAS and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20510, April 29, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Eulogia Bigornia Cardenas filed a complaint against her husband, Leoncio Cardenas, and his mistress, seeking support, accounting of fruits, and administration of conjugal properties [1]. Eulogia claimed the spouses constructed a house in Caloocan, the rentals of which were being received by petitioner Felicidad Tolentino [1]. Tolentino claimed she owned the lot (TCT No. 38550) and had purchased the house from Leoncio [2]. The trial court ruled in favor of Eulogia, declaring "the sale, if any, of the house and lot in question to Felicidad Tolentino as null and void" for violating Article 166 of the Civil Code [3]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [4]. Tolentino appealed, questioning the annulment of the sale regarding the lot and house [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sale of the conjugal house by the husband without the wife's consent is void.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the sale of the house is null and void for lack of the necessary marital consent as provided in Article 166 of the New Civil Code [6]. The records established that the house was constructed by the spouses in 1948 and sold by the husband to Tolentino in 1954 without the consent of the wife [6].

Regarding the lot, the Court clarified that the lower court declared void only the "sale, if any" [6]. Since there was no finding that the lot belonged to the conjugal partnership or that a sale of the lot actually took place between the husband and Tolentino, the decision does not affect Tolentino's title to the lot [7].

The petition is dismissed and the decision affirmed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [8].
