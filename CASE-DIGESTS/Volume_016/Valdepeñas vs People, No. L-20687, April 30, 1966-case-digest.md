I. CAPTION
MAXIMINO VALDEPEÑAS v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20687, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 25, 1956, Ester Ulsano (17 years old), assisted by her mother, filed a complaint for forcible abduction with rape against petitioner Maximino Valdepeñas in the Justice of the Peace Court of Piat, Cagayan [1]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cagayan subsequently convicted Valdepeñas [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the judgment, convicting him instead of abduction with consent, but remanded the case to the CFI to determine the offended party's age [3].

After the CFI reiterated its findings and the CA affirmed the conviction [4], Valdepeñas filed a motion for reconsideration. He argued for the first time that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over his person and the subject matter (abduction with consent) because the original complaint filed by the offended party was for forcible abduction, not abduction with consent [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused.
2. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction over the crime of abduction with consent despite the complaint charging forcible abduction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the person of an accused is acquired upon apprehension or submission to the court's jurisdiction. The petitioner was brought before the Justice of the Peace Court, the CFI, and the CA multiple times over a period of six years and never questioned the judicial authority over his person until the very end [5, 6]. By taking steps such as filing motions, he implied not merely submission but urged the courts to exercise authority over him, effectively waiving any objection [5, 7].

2. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law (Judiciary Act of 1948), not by the complaint required under Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) [8, 9]. The complaint under Article 344 is merely a condition precedent to prosecution, imposed to spare the victim from the scandal of a public trial [8, 9].

The Court held that a complaint for forcible abduction includes abduction with consent [10, 11]. The willingness of the offended party and her mother to undergo the scandal of a trial for forcible abduction necessarily implies their willingness to face the scandal of a trial for abduction with consent [10, 12]. Furthermore, regarding the element of virginity under Article 343 of the RPC, the law does not require physical virginity but refers to a virtuous woman of good reputation; the presumption of innocence includes the presumption of chastity [13-15].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [16].
