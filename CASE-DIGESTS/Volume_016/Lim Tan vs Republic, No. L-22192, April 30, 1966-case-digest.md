I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. VIRGILIO LIM TAN alias BOYBAC v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22192, April 30, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 11, 1962, Virgilio Lim Tan, alias Boybac, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental [1]. In his petition, he stated only one place of residence: Toboso, Negros Occidental, where he claimed to have resided continuously for twenty-two years [2]. However, during the proceedings, Lim Tan testified that he completed his secondary education at Silliman University in Dumaguete City and his college education at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, indicating he had resided in those cities during his studies [2]. Furthermore, Lim Tan testified that he was not related to his father's business partner, Tan Pong; however, his own character witness testified that Tan Pong was actually Lim Tan's uncle [3]. The CFI denied the petition on September 3, 1963, citing failure to prove belief in the Constitution, desire to embrace customs, lucrative income, and moral irreproachability [4]. Lim Tan appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state former places of residence in the petition for naturalization is fatal.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses the irreproachable conduct required for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires that the petition specify all places of residence, temporary or otherwise [2]. The record disclosed that the petitioner resided in Dumaguete City and Cebu City for his studies, but failed to include these in his petition [2]. The Supreme Court held that the failure to state such other places of residence is fatal to the application, regardless of whether the omitted places are later supplied by the evidence during the trial, citing *Lo v. Republic* and *Qua v. Republic* [2].

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's doubt regarding the petitioner's good moral character [3]. Lim Tan gave false testimony by denying his relationship to his father's partner, who was proven to be his uncle [3]. The Court ruled that a false statement by the petitioner demonstrates a lack of irreproachable conduct required by the Naturalization Law, citing *Justa Tan v. Republic* [3].

The decision of the lower court denying the petition for naturalization is **AFFIRMED** [5].
