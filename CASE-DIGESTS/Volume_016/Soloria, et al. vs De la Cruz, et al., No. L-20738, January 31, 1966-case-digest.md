I. CAPTION
JULIANA SOLORIA and ANACLETO PASAMONTE v. CEFRONIO DE LA CRUZ and HON. TOMAS P. PANGANIBAN, Presiding Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations, First Regional District, G.R. No. L-20738, January 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cefronio De la Cruz filed a tenancy case against Petitioner Juliana Soloria (later amended to include Petitioner Pasamonte) in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for reinstatement and damages, alleging illegal ejectment [1]. The trial was scheduled for June 8, 1962, but neither the petitioners nor their counsel appeared [2]. Consequently, the CAR allowed De la Cruz to present evidence *ex parte* and considered the case submitted for decision [2].

Counsel for petitioners only received the notice of the June 8 hearing on June 14, 1962, six days after the scheduled date [3]. Although counsel received the order submitting the case for decision on August 8, 1962, he filed no pleadings [2]. On August 30, 1962, the CAR rendered a decision in favor of De la Cruz [3]. Three days later, petitioners moved for reconsideration (treated as a motion for new trial), citing the lack of notice as an "accident" [3, 4]. The CAR denied the motion, ruling that petitioners were negligent for failing to assert their rights between August 8 and August 30, and for failing to attach an affidavit of merits [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners are entitled to a new trial due to the lack of advance notice of the hearing.
2. W/N an affidavit of merits is necessary to support the motion for new trial in this case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure of counsel to attend the trial because he did not receive advance notice constitutes an "accident" within the meaning of Section 1, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, which is a valid ground for a new trial [6]. The Supreme Court rejected the lower court's reasoning that petitioners waived their right to be heard by failing to act between receiving the submission order (August 8) and the judgment (August 30). Renunciation of the fundamental right to a day in court is not lightly inferred, and the Rules allow parties to move for relief even after judgment [7].

2. **NO.** Affidavits of merits are not required when the granting of a new trial is not discretionary but demandable as a matter of right [8]. Since the petitioners were deprived of their day in court through no fault of their own (due to lack of notice), the proceedings were procedurally defective and the judgment void, making an affidavit of merits unnecessary [8, 9].

The petition is granted, the resolution is set aside, and a new trial is granted [10].
