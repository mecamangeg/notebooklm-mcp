I. CAPTION
DR. IRINEO P. SIA, ET AL. v. PABLO CUNETA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22388, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were appointed by the President as members of the Board of Tax Appeals of Pasay City. They requested the Respondents (the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Municipal Board of Pasay City) to provide office space, supplies, equipment, and to appropriate funds for the Board's salaries and sundry expenses. Petitioners claimed damages totaling P7,450 for fiscal year 1962-1963 and P15,480 for 1963-1964. The Respondents denied these requests. After failing to secure relief through administrative channels involving the Department of Finance and the City Treasurer, Petitioners filed an original action for Mandamus before the Supreme Court. Respondents argued that the appropriation of funds involves discretion and that the Board lacked authority to employ personnel other than a secretary.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mandamus lies to compel the Respondents to appropriate funds and pay the expenses and salaries claimed by the Petitioners.
2. W/N the Board of Tax Appeals has the power to appoint personnel other than a Secretary.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that while the Municipal Board is duty-bound under Sections 16(b) and 40 of Republic Act No. 183 (Pasay City Charter) to provide for the expenses of the Board of Tax Appeals, Mandamus will not lie unless the right to the demand is clear and the claim is "liquidated and certain." The Court held that where a board must examine a claim to determine its correctness, or where the compensation is not fixed by law, the act involves discretion (citing 34 Am. Jur., p. 943). Here, the Petitioners' claims were unliquidated as the exact emoluments were not established by law or evidence.

2. **NO.** Section 40 of Republic Act No. 183, as amended by Republic Act No. 3275, explicitly limits the Board of Tax Appeals' power to appointing a Secretary. The Court declared the Board "absolutely bereft of power" to appoint other employees, such as a laborer and a steno-typist; thus, claims for their salaries cannot be upheld.

Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.
