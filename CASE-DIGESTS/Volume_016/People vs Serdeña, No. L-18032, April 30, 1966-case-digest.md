**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GORGONIO SERDEÑA, G.R. No. L-18032, April 30, 1966, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On January 9, 1959, in Sta. Fe, Leyte, the accused Gorgonio Serdeña and the victim, Genaro Roldan, were drinking *tuba* at a store [1]. Roldan became intoxicated and fell asleep on a bench outside the store [2]. Around 8:00 P.M., Serdeña returned with an 18-inch bolo, stated "You will not be saved anymore, Pacanap," and stabbed the sleeping Roldan, causing his instantaneous death [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance convicted Serdeña of murder [4]. Serdeña appealed, claiming he acted in defense of a relative (his wife) whom he alleged Roldan tried to attack, and further argued he was entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the accused’s claim of defense of a relative is credible.
2. W/N proof of motive is necessary for conviction.
3. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender applies.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court found the defense incredible. The trial court rejected the testimony of defense witnesses as they were relatives of the accused and thus not impartial, and noted the accused's demeanor was unconvincing [5]. The Supreme Court applied the rule that findings of fact by trial courts are generally not disturbed on appeal because trial judges are in a better position to assess witness credibility [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court found it "foolishly reckless" and contrary to instinct for the victim to attack the accused's wife in front of a store full of people [9].

2. **NO.** Since the accused admitted to the killing, the failure to establish motive is "completely inconsequential" (*People v. Ramirez*) [6, 10, 11].

3. **NO.** The records refuted the claim. Serdeña alleged he surrendered on January 12, 1959, but the warrant for his arrest was issued on January 17, 1959, which would have been unnecessary had he already surrendered [6, 10]. The warrant itself noted he surrendered on January 27, 1959 [6].

**Decision affirmed.** [4, 12]
