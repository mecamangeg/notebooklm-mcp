I. CAPTION
CELESTINO E. ESUERTE, MARIA BITOY, HONORATO LUTERO, and ANATOLIO BARCENA v. DELFIN JAMPAYAS, EULOGIO VIAJEDOR, DEMETRIO B. HECHANOVA, ANTONIO MACADANGDANG, RICARDO BITOY, FRANCISCO ESQUIERDA and HON. SALVADOR MARIÑO, G.R. No. L-23301, February 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Esuerte, Bitoy, Lutero, and Barcena were designated by then President Carlos P. Garcia as acting Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Councilors of the municipality of Mawab, Davao prior to June 1961. They claimed they were issued *ad interim* appointments dated June 1, 1961. However, they only took their oaths of office in January 1962.

Evidence presented by the Office of the President showed that on December 18, 1961—after the presidential elections—a directive was issued to convert designations into *ad interim* appointments, backdating them to appear as if made before the elections. The appointments were actually processed on December 25, 1961, and transmitted to the Commission on Appointments on December 29, 1961 [1].

Incoming President Diosdado Macapagal issued Administrative Order No. 2, revoking "midnight appointments" made by his predecessor after December 13, 1961 [2]. He subsequently designated respondents Jampayas et al. to the positions in 1963. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition and *quo warranto*, which the Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the *ad interim* appointments of the petitioners were valid and effective.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that the petitioners' appointments were invalid "midnight appointments."

The Court held that the appointments were actually made in late December 1961, not on the June 1, 1961 date appearing on the documents. This was corroborated by the petitioners' own conduct in failing to qualify or take their oaths until January 1962 [4, 5]. Had the appointments truly been made in June, their interests would have dictated that they qualify immediately to secure their tenure [6].

Consequently, the appointments fell under the rule laid down in *Aytona v. Castillo* (G.R. No. L-19313) and *Rodriguez v. Quirino* (G.R. No. L-19800), which invalidated irregular mass appointments made by an outgoing President to deprive the incoming administration of the prerogative to fill positions [7].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the municipality of Mawab was created only by an executive order. Citing *Pelaez v. Auditor General* (G.R. No. L-23825), which ruled that the creation of municipalities by the Executive is unconstitutional, the Court found no error in the lower court's refusal to interfere with the respondents' designations [8].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
