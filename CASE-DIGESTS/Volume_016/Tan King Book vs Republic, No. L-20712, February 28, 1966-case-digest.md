I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO THE PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. TAN KING BOOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20712, February 28, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan King Book, a Chinese citizen residing in Ozamis City, applied for naturalization. He claimed to be married to one "Wong Soi Tee" residing in Hong Kong. He testified that he was employed at the Misamis Soap and Candle Factory with an annual salary of approximately P2,500.00, plus a share in profits, totaling around P5,000.00 annually. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted his petition. The Republic appealed, arguing inter alia that the petitioner failed to prove his marriage and lacked lucrative income. Evidence revealed that Tan’s Alien Certificate of Registration and Income Tax Returns listed his wife as "Uy See Teh" residing in Amoy, China, not Hong Kong. Furthermore, Tan admitted he had not visited his wife during his 32-year residence in the Philippines.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner established the fact of his marriage and identity of his spouse sufficiently to qualify for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner failed to establish by satisfactory evidence the fact of his marriage and the identity of his spouse. There was a discrepancy between the name "Wong Soi Tee" (Hong Kong) testified to and "Uy See Teh" (Amoy) appearing in official documents, with no evidence presented to prove they are the same person [1, 2]. Failure to clearly establish the identity of the spouse is a fatal impediment to the application [3]. Moreover, his failure to visit his wife for 32 years indicates he is not a person of good moral character and has not embraced the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipino people [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The Court found that petitioner’s only steady income was his salary of approximately P2,500.00 per year. Additional income from bonuses and commissions is excluded as it is not shown to be steady (*Rafael Pe v. Republic*) [6]. Even assuming an income of P5,000.00, it is not considered lucrative for a married applicant, especially considering the high cost of living in Hong Kong where his alleged wife resides (*Tan v. Republic; Yap v. Republic; Lim Uy v. Republic*) [7].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED.
