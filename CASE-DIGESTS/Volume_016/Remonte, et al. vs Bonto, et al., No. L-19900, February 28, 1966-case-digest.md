I. CAPTION
EXPEDITO REMONTE and SECURITY CREDIT & ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION v. AQUILINO P. BONTO, City Fiscal of Legaspi City, et al., G.R. No. L-19900, February 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On January 9, 1962, NBI agents entered the Legaspi City branch office of Security Credit & Acceptance Corporation to investigate alleged violations of the General Banking Act (R.A. No. 337) [1]. On the same day, City Fiscal Aquilino P. Bonto subpoenaed the branch manager, Expedito Remonte [2]. On January 22, Remonte and the corporation filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Albay for injunction and damages to stop the investigation, arguing it was unauthorized [2]. The Fiscal moved to dismiss the complaint on February 3, 1962, setting the hearing for February 8 [3, 4]. However, the petitioners received the copy of the motion only on February 10, two days after the court had already issued an order denying the injunction and dismissing the case [4]. Petitioners appealed, claiming they were denied their day in court due to the lack of the required three-day notice for the hearing [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the complaint was valid despite the petitioners not receiving the three-day notice of hearing for the motion to dismiss.
2. W/N the NBI agents had the authority to conduct the investigation.
3. W/N the petition for injunction should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The purpose of the three-day notice requirement, which is "to avoid surprises upon the opposite party and to give to the latter time to study and meet the arguments of the motion" (*J.M. Tuason & Co. vs. Magdangal*), was sufficiently complied with [5]. The legal question regarding the defendants' right to investigate had already been thoroughly argued in the parties' previous pleadings, including the oppositions to the writ of preliminary injunction and the answer [6]. Consequently, the hearing was a superfluity, and the failure to give notice was a harmless error that did not affect the court's jurisdiction [7]. Furthermore, the proper remedy for the lack of notice was a motion for reconsideration, which the petitioners failed to file [7].

2. **YES.** Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 157, NBI agents are charged with the duty to undertake investigations of crimes "upon their own initiative and as public interest may require" [8]. The agents acted with color of authority, and the investigation was not "public" as claimed since it was conducted inside the corporation's premises [8]. There was no showing of bad faith to support the claim for damages [9].

3. **NO.** The investigation had already been concluded and a criminal case filed (though later dismissed), meaning the acts sought to be enjoined were already consummated [10]. Injunction operates only upon unperformed acts and cannot undo what has already been done [11]. Moreover, the dismissal of the related criminal case rendered the civil action for damages and injunction moot and academic [12].

The order appealed from is affirmed [13].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred [13].
