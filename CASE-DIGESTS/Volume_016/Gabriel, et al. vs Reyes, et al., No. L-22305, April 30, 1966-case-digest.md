**I. CAPTION**
PRAXEDES GABRIEL, et al., petitioners, vs. THE HONORABLE ANDRES REYES, as Judge of Rizal, Branch IV and THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, respondents, G.R. No. L-22305, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners were owners of a 4.2-hectare parcel of land in Malabon, Rizal [1]. The Republic previously instituted an expropriation proceeding against them (Civil Case No. 344) under Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 539 [1]. The Supreme Court dismissed this first action in G.R. No. L-6161 on May 28, 1954, ruling that the property was too small to be considered a "landed estate" within the purview of the Constitution [1, 2].

On June 17, 1963, the Republic, through the Land Tenure Administration, filed a second expropriation case (Civil Case No. 7737) covering the same land, this time invoking Republic Act (RA) No. 1162, as amended [3]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the case on the ground that it was barred by the prior judgment in G.R. No. L-6161 [3]. Respondent Judge Reyes denied the motion to dismiss [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to set aside the order and restrain proceedings [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the second expropriation complaint filed under RA No. 1162 is barred by the prior judgment dismissing the expropriation under CA No. 539.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that the decision in G.R. No. L-6161 bars the second action [5]. Both CA No. 539 and RA No. 1162 are predicated on the same constitutional mandate found in Section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution [2, 6]. Since the two Acts rely on the same authority, the cause of action in both proceedings is substantially the same [6].

Consequently, the Court's prior finding in L-6161—that the subject land (less than 4.2 hectares) is not a "landed estate"—applies with equal force to proceedings under RA No. 1162 [6]. The respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss.

The order is set aside and the respondent Judge is perpetually restrained from further proceeding in Civil Case No. 7737 [7].
