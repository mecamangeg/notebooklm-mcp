I. CAPTION
CECILLA RAPADAZ VDA. DE RAPISURA v. HON. NICANOR NICOLAS and FR. JACINTO RAPADAZ, G.R. No. L-22594, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Fr. Jacinto Rapadaz (plaintiff) filed a civil case against Cecilla Rapadaz Vda. de Rapisura (defendant). After presenting some evidence, Fr. Rapadaz failed to appear at a subsequent hearing. Consequently, Judge Nicolas dismissed the case without prejudice on November 26, 1963. Fr. Rapadaz filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which Rapisura opposed on two grounds: (1) the motion lacked the required proof of service, and (2) it was allegedly filed out of time. Judge Nicolas granted the motion and set aside the dismissal order on February 4, 1964. Rapisura filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in entertaining a motion that was a mere "scrap of paper" and legally late.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the Motion for Reconsideration despite the lack of proof of service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, holding that the Judge did not abuse his discretion.

First, regarding the lack of proof of service, the Court noted that the petitioner admitted to actually receiving a copy of the motion and was present during its hearing. Thus, the demands of substantial justice were satisfied, and the Judge validly overlooked the technical defect [1].

Second, the Court found the motion was filed within the reglementary period with the Office of the Clerk of Court, even if it reached the specific Branch Clerk later [2].

Third, the Court applied the doctrine that **certiorari is an equitable relief** which may be withheld when the ends of justice would not be served. Since the original dismissal was *without prejudice*, the plaintiff could have simply filed a new action. Therefore, the petitioner suffered no substantial injury by the reinstatement of the case, losing only a "technical victory" [3].

Finally, the Court observed that when a plaintiff fails to appear after already presenting evidence, the proper procedure is to deem them as having waived the right to present *additional* evidence and to render judgment based on the evidence already on record, rather than dismissing the case. This justified the Judge's reconsideration of the dismissal order [4].

**Petition dismissed.**
