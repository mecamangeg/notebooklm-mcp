**I. CAPTION**
STATE BONDING & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD CO., G.R. No. L-21833, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
State Bonding & Insurance Company, Inc. (insurer) filed a suit for recovery of damages against Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) and Manila Railroad Co. covering eight causes of action for short-landed or bad order cargoes. The defendants invoked Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract, which relieves them of liability unless a claim for value is filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel.

In the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th causes of action, the consignees filed "provisional claims" within the 15-day period. These provisional claims described the importations but did not state the value of the goods or attach supporting documents, reserving the right to file formal claims later. In the 3rd cause of action, the last package was discharged on November 23, 1959, but the provisional claim was filed only on December 10, 1959. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants appealed, arguing that the provisional claims were insufficient compliance with Section 15.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a provisional claim filed within the 15-day period, which lacks a statement of value and supporting documents, constitutes sufficient compliance with the requirement of the Arrastre Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that a provisional claim filed after the discharge of goods and within the 15-day period is sufficient compliance, even if it does not state the amount or carry accompanying documents. The reason underlying the requirement in Section 15 is to give the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while the facts are still fresh in the minds of the persons involved and documents are available [1]. The provisional claims herein contained descriptions sufficient to allow reasonable verification [2]. The precise amount and supporting papers may be reserved for the formal claim, as their preparation requires more time and care [3].

However, regarding the **3rd cause of action**, the claim was filed 17 days after the discharge of the last package (November 23 to December 10), which is beyond the 15-day limit; thus, recovery is barred [4].

The judgment of the lower court is **MODIFIED**. The awards under the 3rd and 7th causes of action are eliminated. The awards under the 1st and 6th causes of action are reduced to stipulated amounts (P3,000 and P500.35, respectively). The judgment is affirmed in all other respects [5].
