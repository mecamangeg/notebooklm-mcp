**I. CAPTION**
EUFRONIO J. LLANTO v. MOHAMAD ALI DIMAPORO, et al., G.R. No. L-21905, March 31, 1966, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Eufronio J. Llanto was the Assistant Provincial Assessor of Lanao del Norte. On January 6, 1960, the Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 7, reverting the salary appropriation for his position to the general fund, effectively abolishing the position. The Board justified this due to a massive deficit of P60,330.60 and the fact that the position was not required by the Administrative Code. Llanto filed a petition for mandamus, alleging the abolition was done maliciously for political persecution. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of cause of action. The Court of First Instance granted the motion and dismissed the petition. Llanto moved for reconsideration, claiming he was not given a hearing on the motion to dismiss, but this was denied. He appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the lower court properly dismissed the petition despite the alleged lack of hearing on the motion to dismiss.
2. W/N the Provincial Board validly abolished the position of Assistant Provincial Assessor.
3. W/N the abolition required the approval of the Secretary of Finance.
4. W/N mandamus lies to compel the restoration of the position.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that oral arguments on a motion to dismiss are reduced to an unnecessary ceremony when the question of law—whether the facts averred constitute a cause of action—has been fully discussed in the motion and the opposition thereto [1]. The purpose of a hearing is to prevent surprise, which was sufficiently met. Furthermore, any defect regarding notice was cured by the petitioner's motion for reconsideration, which afforded him the opportunity to be heard (De Borja v. Tan) [2].

2. **YES.** The power to create a position normally carries with it the power to abolish it. While abolition must be in good faith, the petitioner's allegation of political persecution was a mere conclusion of law unsupported by factual premises [3]. This cannot overcome the legal presumptions of good faith (Art. 527, Civil Code) and regularity in the performance of official duty (Sec. 5[m], Rule 131, Rules of Court) [4]. The facts showed a financial deficit and that the position was dispensable.

3. **NO.** The Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264) eliminated the necessity of the Secretary of Finance's approval for the abolition of positions [5]. The Secretary's authority is limited to reviewing budgets and tax ordinances. Under Section 12 of the Act, implied powers of local governments are to be liberally construed in their favor, and the power to withdraw unexpended appropriations is implied from the power to appropriate [5, 6].

4. **NO.** Mandamus compels the performance of a ministerial duty that is clear and specific. It is not meant to control the normal exercise of judgment or discretion [7]. Since the restoration of the budget item involves discretion, the Board cannot be compelled by mandamus to do so.

The order appealed from is affirmed [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Concurring Justices listed without separate opinions: C.J. Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar. J.B.L. Reyes did not take part) [8].
