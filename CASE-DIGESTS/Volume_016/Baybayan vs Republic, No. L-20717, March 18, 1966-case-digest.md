**I. CAPTION**
CONSUELO CALICDAN BAYBAYAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20717, March 18, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Consuelo Calicdan Baybayan filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to correct the certificate of live birth of Bartolome C. Baybayan, Jr. Specifically, she sought to change the child's citizenship from "American" to "Filipino" and the birthplace from "Balungao" to "Urdaneta" [1]. The petitioner stated the correction was necessary to entitle the child to a living allowance from his father, Bartolome E. Baybayan [2]. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to order such substantial changes in a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioner, and the Republic appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1, 3]. Notably, the father was not served with a copy of the petition and did not appear in the proceedings [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial court may order substantial alterations to citizenship and status in the civil registry through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court reasoned that summary proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code only justify the correction of innocuous or clerical errors, such as visible misspellings, and not substantial alterations affecting the status and citizenship of a person [4, 5]. Citing *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic* and *Ansaldo v. Republic*, the Court held that such grave matters must be threshed out in an "appropriate action wherein all parties who may be affected by the entries are notified or represented," as provided in Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court [5, 6]. Additionally, the Court found a violation of due process because the father, whose citizenship and obligations were effectively being altered, was not notified of the petition [2].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [7].
