I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NICOLAS QUINTAB, G.R. No. L-21417, January 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of July 5, 1962, Jesus Navarra and Wilfredo Berja went to the provincial jail in Bacolod City to visit detained prisoners regarding bail bonds [1], [2]. While they were conversing with the detainees, the accused, prisoner Nicolas Quintab, suddenly stabbed Navarra from behind with a "flamenco" knife on the nape and breast [2]. Navarra died from the stab wounds [3], [2].

Quintab admitted to the killing but claimed self-defense [4]. He alleged that he accidentally bumped into Navarra, who then slapped and boxed him. Quintab claimed a knife fell to the floor during the scuffle, which he retrieved to stab Navarra [4]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental rejected this version, convicted Quintab of murder, and sentenced him to life imprisonment [1]. Quintab appealed, challenging the credibility of the witnesses [1], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused proved that the killing was legally justifiable (self-defense).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that since the accused admitted the killing, the burden of proving that the slaying was legally justifiable shifted to him [6], [7], [5]. Quintab failed to meet this burden.

The Court gave greater weight to the testimony of prosecution witness Wilfredo Berja, who was a neutral and disinterested party, over the self-serving testimony of the accused [6], [5]. The Court applied the established rule that the trial court's opinion on the credibility of witnesses is entitled to great weight in the absence of plain error, citing *People vs. Cabrera* and *U.S. vs. Melad* [8], [9], [10]. Furthermore, the defense's version that the knife fell from the victim or was thrown by his companion was improbable, as it contradicted prison regulations prohibiting visitors from bringing weapons [11].

**Judgment affirmed.** [12], [13]
