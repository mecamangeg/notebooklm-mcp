I. CAPTION
*IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ALFRED BUN THO KHU TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, ALFRED BUN THO KHU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES*, G.R. No. L-21828, January 22, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On January 21, 1958, Alfred Bun Tho Khu filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Manila [1]. While the petition was pending, he left the Philippines for the United States on June 7, 1959, and returned on October 15, 1959 [1]. The trial court granted his petition on April 19, 1960 [1]. Two years later, on July 18, 1962, he filed a motion to take his oath as a Filipino citizen [1]. The Republic opposed the motion, arguing that Bun Tho Khu lacked good moral character because he violated his sworn commitment to reside continuously in the Philippines from the filing of the petition until his admission to citizenship [1]. The trial court denied the motion on May 7, 1963, ruling that his four-month absence violated Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [1]. Bun Tho Khu appealed, arguing that he had already been granted citizenship and the matter was *res judicata* [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner failed to comply with the continuous residence requirement under the Revised Naturalization Law by leaving the country for four months.
2. W/N the government is barred by *res judicata* from questioning the applicant's qualifications at the oath-taking stage.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner failed to comply. Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires the applicant to state under oath that he will "reside continuously in the Philippines from the date of the filing of the petition up to the time of his admission to Philippine citizenship" [3]. Citing *Uytengsu v. Republic*, the Court held that this requirement refers to "actual and substantial residence" and is violated if the petitioner leaves the country for a significant period (e.g., three months) during the intervening period [3]. By leaving for over four months, the petitioner reneged on a solemn oath, which reflects adversely on his moral character and disqualifies him from citizenship [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The doctrine of *res judicata* does not apply. It is settled jurisprudence that during the hearing on the petition to take the oath, any question affecting the qualifications of the applicant may be invoked (*Lim Hok Albano v. Republic*; *Ong Ching Guan v. Republic*) [2, 4]. The petitioner's qualifications are subject to scrutiny until he actually takes the oath.

**Disposition:** Order affirmed [5].
