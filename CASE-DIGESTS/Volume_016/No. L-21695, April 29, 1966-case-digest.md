I. CAPTION
ILDEFONSO AGREDA, ET AL. v. HON. JESUS S. RODRIGUEZ and SANTIAGO AGREDA, G.R. No. L-21695, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In a cadastral case involving Lot No. 3400, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo originally declared the lot as public land. Respondent Santiago Agreda appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the lower court’s decision and adjudicated the lot to him. Petitioners Ildefonso Agreda, et al., who did not appeal the CFI decision, later filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed on February 25, 1963.

Subsequently, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 6267 for reconveyance and partition against Santiago. Meanwhile, Santiago applied for a writ of possession in the original cadastral case. Respondent Judge Rodriguez granted the writ on June 8, 1963, and denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration. Petitioners filed this action for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing the writ while the civil case for reconveyance was pending.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing the writ of possession.
2. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The respondent Judge had jurisdiction to pass upon the motion for the issuance of a writ of possession. The determination of whether the motion should have been denied due to the institution of the separate civil case for reconveyance is a matter that does not affect said jurisdiction [1]. The Court held that the writ of possession is merely a logical consequence of the Court of Appeals' decision adjudicating the lot to Santiago Agreda [2]. Citing *Romasanta vs. Platon*, the Court reiterated that Courts of First Instance have inherent power to compel obedience to their judgments and to issue writs of execution or possession to enforce ownership adjudications [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that certiorari is not the proper remedy because the petitioners could have appealed the order granting the writ of possession [4]. It is a settled rule that where an appeal is available, the extraordinary writ of certiorari will not lie [5].

The petition is dismissed and the writ prayed for is denied [6].
