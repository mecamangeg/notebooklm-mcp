I. CAPTION
PAULINA SANTOS and AURORA SANTOS v. GREGORIA ARANZANSO and DEMETRIA VENTURA, G.R. No. L-23828, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1949, spouses Simplicio Santos and Juliana Reyes filed a petition for the adoption of minors Paulina (17) and Aurora (8) Santos. The petition alleged that the minors' parents had abandoned them and that they had been in the spouses' custody since infancy. The Court of First Instance (CFI) granted the adoption after finding that the parents had long been unheard from despite diligent efforts to locate them. No appeal was taken.

In 1957, Juliana Reyes died intestate. Simplicio filed a petition for the settlement of her estate. Respondents Gregoria Aranzanso and Demetria Ventura (claiming to be the decedent's first cousins, with Demetria also claiming to be Paulina's mother) opposed the petition. They collaterally attacked the validity of the adoption, arguing it was void *ab initio* due to the lack of written consent from the natural parents, who they claimed had not abandoned the children.

The probate court ruled that the adoption could not be assailed collaterally. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the order, declaring the adoption void for lack of parental consent and finding insufficient evidence of abandonment in the original proceedings. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the validity of the adoption decree can be collaterally attacked by the respondents in the intestate proceedings on the ground of lack of parental consent and abandonment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and affirmed the probate court's order.

Under Section 3, Rule 100 of the Old Rules of Court, consent by the parents is not an absolute requisite; it is dispensed with if the natural parents have abandoned the child. In such cases, the consent of the guardian *ad litem* suffices. The original adoption court found that the parents had long been unheard from and had left the children in the petitioners' care since infancy, which constitutes abandonment—defined as conduct evincing a settled purpose to forgo parental duties.

Even assuming the adoption court's finding of abandonment was erroneous, it cannot be questioned in a collateral attack. The settled rule is that when the jurisdiction of a tribunal depends upon the existence of a fact to be established before it, the determination of that fact by the tribunal is conclusive and cannot be collaterally attacked (citing *In re McKeag’s Estate*). The CA erred in reviewing the evidence of abandonment from the 1949 proceedings in a 1957 collateral suit. Furthermore, adoption is a proceeding *in rem*, and constructive notice via publication is sufficient to bind the parents. Finally, the philosophy of adoption statutes is to encourage adoption to promote the child's welfare; thus, the decree must be sustained against collateral attacks by strangers to the proceedings.

**Disposition:** The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the probate court sustaining the adoption is affirmed. Respondents are declared without right to intervene as heirs.
