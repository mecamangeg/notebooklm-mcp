I. CAPTION
MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-21435, February 28, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Manila Electric Company (Meralco) holds a legislative franchise under Act No. 484 to operate an electric light, heat, and power system in the "City of Manila and its suburbs." On February 28, 1947, Meralco filed a petition with respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) to reconstitute its records. Years later, on September 10, 1962, the PSC ordered Meralco to show cause why it should not be penalized for operating in Quezon City, Pasay City, and various municipalities in Rizal (including Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, etc.) without authority.

The PSC ruled that Meralco's franchise under Act No. 484 was limited to the "City of Manila" (interpreted by PSC as Intramuros) and its "suburbs" (interpreted as 1902 districts like Tondo, Quiapo, and Malate). Consequently, the PSC ordered Meralco to obtain a new legislative or municipal franchise to operate in the outlying municipalities. Meralco appealed, arguing that these municipalities constitute the "suburbs" contemplated in its original franchise and that it had operated there for decades with the government's acquiescence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Meralco is required to obtain a new legislative franchise to operate in the areas of Malabon, Navotas, Caloocan, San Juan, Quezon City, Mandaluyong, Makati, Pasay, Parañaque, and Las Piñas.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the orders of the Public Service Commission. The Court ruled that the municipalities in question are comprehended within the term "suburbs" in Meralco's franchise (Act No. 484).

The Court rejected the PSC's theory that "suburbs" in 1902 referred to districts like Tondo or Ermita. Under the Original Charter of Manila (Act No. 183) and Act No. 341, those districts were explicitly part of the legal boundaries of the City of Manila, not suburbs [1], [2]. Therefore, "suburbs" meant the regions adjacent to and beyond the city limits [3].

Additionally, the Court applied the principle of **express acquiescence** based on administrative practice. Meralco had served these areas since the early 1900s and paid franchise taxes to them. The fact that none of these municipalities ever complained to the PSC regarding Meralco's operation resulted in an acquiescence to the interpretation that the franchise extended to their jurisdictions [4], [5].

The orders appealed from were set aside [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
