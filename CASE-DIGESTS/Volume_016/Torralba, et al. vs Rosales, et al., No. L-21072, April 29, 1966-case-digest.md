I. CAPTION
**BRUNO TORRALBA and CARMEN TORRALBA v. ZACARIAS ROSALES, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-21072, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On December 2, 1958, respondent Zacarias Rosales filed a complaint for forcible entry (Case No. 356) against petitioners Bruno and Carmen Torralba in the Municipal Court of Butuan City [1]. Rosales alleged that he had prior possession of a parcel of land in Tomampi, Banza, Butuan City, and that the petitioners ousted him from the northern portion (400 sq. m.) on October 28, 1958, through force, intimidation, strategy, and stealth [1].

In their answer, the petitioners admitted the allegations of entry but qualified that they were the owners in fee simple of the property and were merely exercising their rights of ownership to use and enjoy the products of the land [2]. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Rosales [1]. The petitioners attempted to appeal, but it was dismissed for being filed out of time [1]. Subsequently, they filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan, arguing that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction because the issue involved title/ownership [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the issue was merely possession [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court had jurisdiction over the forcible entry case despite the defendants raising the issue of ownership in their answer.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The Court held that the complaint was clearly predicated upon prior possession and the deprivation thereof by force, intimidation, strategy, and stealth [2]. The petitioners' admission of entry, subject to their claim of ownership, did not divest the Municipal Court of jurisdiction.

The Court applied the principle that in forcible entry cases, the main issue is merely whether the plaintiff has been deprived of possession [2, 3]. Although the defendants invoked their alleged title to the land, this was done merely to bolster their claim of a better right to continue in possession [2, 3]. Therefore, the issue of ownership was incidental and did not remove the case from the jurisdiction of the municipal court [2, 4].

**Decision affirmed.**
