I. CAPTION
FELIPE YUPANGCO & SONS, INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22259, January 19, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Felipe Yupangco & Sons, Inc. imported a shipment declared as "phonograph parts and materials" and presented a Central Bank (CB) release certificate covering the same under Code 890102 NEC [1, 2]. Upon examination, Customs found the shipment actually contained six complete Wurlitzer coin-operated phonograph machines in knocked-down condition, which fell under Code 710660 UI [1]. The commercial invoice listed the unit price as "$735.00 per phonograph" rather than per part [3].

The Collector of Customs declared the shipment forfeited for violation of CB Circulars 44 and 45 in relation to Sections 1250 and 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code due to the discrepancy between the declaration and the actual goods [4]. The Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision [4]. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained the forfeiture, ruling that the importation consisted of unassembled machines rather than mere parts [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the importation of complete articles in knocked-down condition should be classified as complete machines rather than parts.
2. W/N the importation is subject to forfeiture for violation of Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45.
3. W/N Central Bank Circular 133 repealed Circulars 44 and 45, thereby abrogating the commodity code classification.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that a complete article, even in its knocked-down condition, is dutiable as an entirety [5]. The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's factual finding that the goods were complete machines, noting that the invoice price was stated "per phonograph" and not per part [3]. Factual findings of the Tax Court supported by evidence are binding on the Supreme Court [6, 7].

2. **YES.** The discrepancy between the CB release certificate (covering parts) and the actual importation (complete machines) constitutes a violation of CB Circulars 44 and 45 [2]. This violation subjects the importation to forfeiture under Sections 1250 and 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [2].

3. **NO.** Circular 133 did not repeal Circulars 44 and 45. Far from abrogating the commodity code classification appended to Circular 44, Circular 133 actually utilizes said classification to determine the amount of special time deposits required for letters of credit [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
