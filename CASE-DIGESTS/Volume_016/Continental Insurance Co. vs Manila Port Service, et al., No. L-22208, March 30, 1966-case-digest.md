I. CAPTION
THE CONTINENTAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, et al., G.R. No. L-22208, March 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
San Miguel Brewery, Inc. imported shipments from the United States, which were discharged in Manila. Upon arrival, portions of the shipments were missing. San Miguel filed a provisional claim with the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), within the required 15-day period [1, 2]. Continental Insurance Company, the insurer, paid San Miguel for the losses and was subrogated to its rights [1].

MPS did not explicitly deny or reject the claim. Instead, it sent a communication stating that if the claimant did not hear from them within one year from the date of discharge, they should be guided by Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract [3-5]. Paragraph 15 stipulates that the contractor is relieved of liability unless suit is brought within one year from the date of discharge of goods, or from the date the claim is rejected or denied [6].

Continental Insurance filed the complaint on October 6, 1961, which was more than one year after the discharge of the goods [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance rendered judgment in favor of Continental Insurance, ruling that since MPS failed to act on the claim, it was deemed rejected upon the expiration of one year from the date of discharge, and the suit was filed within one year from that constructive rejection [2, 3]. MPS appealed, arguing this interpretation illegally extends the prescriptive period to two years [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for damages is barred by prescription under the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.

Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract provides two periods for filing an action: (1) one year from the date of discharge, or (2) one year from the date of rejection or denial of the claim [8]. These periods must be synchronized. The first applies when the claimant sues without waiting for a ruling; the second applies when the claimant waits for the contractor's decision [9].

In cases where the arrastre contractor fails to act on the claim within the one-year period from discharge, the claim is deemed rejected as of the expiration of that one year [9]. Consequently, the action may be filed within one year from said constructive rejection. The Court held this interpretation to be fair and reasonable, especially since MPS's own communication implied the claimant could wait for a decision or the expiration of the year [4, 10]. Since the suit was filed within the one-year "grace period" following the deemed rejection, it was not time-barred [10].

Decision affirmed [11].
