I. CAPTION
ARMANDO ESPERANZA v. ANDRES CASTILLO, et al., G.R. No. L-21810, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Armando Esperanza, a janitor-messenger at the Central Bank since 1953, was formally charged with dishonesty and violation of regulations on November 9, 1961, by Mario P. Marcos, the Officer-in-Charge of the Central Bank [3]. Marcos designated a committee to investigate the charges [3]. Esperanza moved to dismiss the administrative complaint on the ground that it was not sworn to by the complainant, Marcos [3, 4]. The committee denied the motion, and the Commissioner of Civil Service sustained the committee's action [4]. Esperanza filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, arguing that the complaint was defective and that the Central Bank Governor (or OIC) lacked the authority of a Department Head to investigate [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the petition [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an administrative complaint filed by the head of an office must be sworn to be valid.
2. W/N the Governor of the Central Bank has the authority of a Department Head to prefer charges and investigate employees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that an administrative complaint filed by the head of a department or office pursuant to Executive Order No. 370 need not be sworn to [6]. This serves as an exception to the proviso in Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260, which states that no complaint shall be given due course unless subscribed and sworn to [6, 7]. The Court reiterated its rulings in *Bautista v. Negado* and *Castillo v. Bayona* regarding this principle [6].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that under the Central Bank Charter (Republic Act No. 265), the Governor is the "chief executive" of the Bank and its "principal representative," with specific authority to direct and supervise operations and internal administration [7]. While the Monetary Board functions like a Board of Directors, the Governor's role is akin to a president or general manager, carrying the duties and responsibilities of a government Department Head [7]. This duty to supervise internal administration logically entails the power to prefer charges against erring officials and ensure they are investigated [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
