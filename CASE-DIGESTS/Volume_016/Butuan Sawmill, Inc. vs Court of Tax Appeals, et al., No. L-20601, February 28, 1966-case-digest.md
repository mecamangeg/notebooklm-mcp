I. CAPTION
BUTUAN SAWMILL, INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20601, February 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
From January 31, 1951, to June 8, 1953, Petitioner Butuan Sawmill, Inc. sold logs to Japanese firms at prices "F.O.B. Agusan" [1]. The buyers paid the freight, opened irrevocable letters of credit, chartered the ships, and insured the cargo [2]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed Petitioner for deficiency sales tax on these transactions [3]. Petitioner argued that the sales were export sales consummated in Japan and thus not subject to domestic sales tax [4]. Petitioner further contended that the right to assess had prescribed because it had filed income tax returns declaring the sales proceeds, which it claimed constituted substantial compliance to trigger the five-year prescriptive period under Section 331 of the Tax Code [5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the assessment, ruling the sales were domestic and the ten-year prescriptive period applied due to the failure to file sales tax returns [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sales of logs to Japanese buyers are subject to domestic sales tax.
2. W/N the right to assess the sales tax has prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The sales were consummated in the Philippines and are subject to sales tax under Section 186 of the Tax Code [6]. The term "F.O.B. Agusan" indicates that the parties intended title to pass to the buyer upon delivery to the vessel in Agusan [7]. This presumption is confirmed by circumstances such as the buyers paying freight and insurance, and the finality of log measurements made in the Philippines [2], [8]. Citing *Taligaman Lumber Co. v. Collector*, the Court held these factors prove the sales were domestic [8]. Although the bill of lading was made to the "order of the seller," under Article 1503 of the Civil Code, this merely reserved ownership for security purposes and did not negate the transfer of title upon delivery to the carrier [9], [10].

2. **NO.** The assessment was made within the legal period. Petitioner failed to file sales tax returns for the years in question [11]. The Court held that filing an income tax return does not constitute a return for sales tax purposes to trigger the five-year limitation under Section 331 of the Tax Code [12]. Since no specific sales tax return was filed, the applicable period is ten years from the discovery of the omission under Section 332(a) [12], [11]. The omission was discovered in 1957, making the assessment valid and timely [11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [11].
