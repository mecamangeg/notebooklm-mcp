I. CAPTION
MALABON RESTAURANT, ET AL. v. THE HEARING OFFICER, REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 4, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, MANILA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22199, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 28, 1962, Antonio Datubio filed a compensation claim against his employers, the owners of Malabon Restaurant, for an illness contracted as their cook [1]. The employers failed to file an answer despite being granted an extension, leading the Hearing Officer to declare them in default on December 27, 1962 [2]. On February 7, 1963, the Hearing Officer rendered a decision granting compensation to Datubio, which became final and executory as the employers failed to appeal [2, 3].

Datubio petitioned the Court of First Instance of Manila to enforce the judgment, which was granted [3]. The employers subsequently filed a petition for relief with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission, which was denied, followed by a petition for review with the Supreme Court, which was also dismissed for lack of merit [3, 4]. When Datubio moved for execution of the judgment, the employers filed the present petition for *certiorari*, arguing that the Hearing Officer and the lower court lacked jurisdiction because the restaurant’s capital was less than P10,000.00 and the business was not hazardous [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is barred by *res judicata*.
2. W/N the Hearing Officer lacked jurisdiction because the employer's capital was less than P10,000.00 or the business was not hazardous.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petition is barred by the previous order dismissing the employers' petition for review, as both petitions raised exactly the same grounds [5]. A party cannot escape the effects of *res judicata* by merely varying the form of action (from review to *certiorari*) or adopting a different method of presenting the case [5, 6]. The policy of the law is to put an end to litigation and it will not allow parties to trifle with the courts through piecemeal litigation [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that claims regarding the employer's income being less than P10,000.00 or the employment being non-hazardous are merely affirmative defenses [7, 8]. Since the petitioners failed to invoke these defenses on time, they are deemed waived [7, 8]. These factors do not deprive the Commission of jurisdiction; the only jurisdictional requirement for a claim to fall within the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is the existence of an employer-employee relationship, as established in *Manila Yacht Club, Inc. v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission* [7, 8].

Petition denied [9].
