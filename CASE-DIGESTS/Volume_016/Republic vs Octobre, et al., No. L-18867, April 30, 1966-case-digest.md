I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CESARIO OCTOBRE, SHERWIN TAMANG, JAMES OLILA, TERIO BAMBICO and ERNESTO ROSIMO, G.R. No. L-18867, April 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Baguio to recover possession of 1.5 hectares of land. The Republic alleged it purchased the land from Ramon Valles in 1925 for the use of the Mountain National Agricultural School and that the defendants were illegally occupying it [1]. The defendants claimed possession since time immemorial and argued that the land was no longer part of the reservation, having been released for disposition by President Magsaysay via Proclamation No. 209 in 1955 [2].

The trial court found that the disputed area was indeed included in the released portion of the reservation and dismissed the complaint on the ground that the School no longer had a claim over the land [2, 3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that a legislative act is required to release reserved land and that, regardless of the release, the court should have determined the actual rights of possession and ownership [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the President has the authority to release reserved land from the public domain by proclamation without a legislative act.
2. W/N the dismissal of the complaint was proper solely because the land was released from the reservation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The President has the authority to re-classify lands. Under Section 64(e) of the Revised Administrative Code, the President may reserve alienable lands for specific public uses. Furthermore, Section 9 of the Public Land Act (Com. Act 141) expressly authorizes the President to classify lands and "at any time and in a similar manner, transfer lands from one class to another," such as from agricultural to reserved areas and vice-versa [5, 6]. Thus, the release of the reservation by Proclamation No. 209 was valid [6].

2. **NO.** The complaint should not have been dismissed merely because the land was released from the reservation. The release makes the land disposable, but it does not automatically determine ownership. The trial court should have continued the hearing to determine the persons entitled to acquire the released land, specifically adjudicating the Republic's claim that it purchased the lot from Ramon Valles and the validity of the defendants' claims of possession [7].

The order appealed from is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
