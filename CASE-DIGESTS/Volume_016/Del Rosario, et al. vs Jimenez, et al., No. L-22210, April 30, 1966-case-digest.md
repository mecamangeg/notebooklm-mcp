**I. CAPTION**
PILAR T. DEL ROSARIO, ET AL. v. HON. DAMIAN L. JIMENEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22210, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondents Sancho R. Jacinto and Domingo C. Bascar filed a motion for reconsideration of the original decision rendered by respondent Judge Damian L. Jimenez of the City Court of Quezon City. This motion was filed before the original decision had become final and executory and before petitioners Del Rosario, et al. had interposed their appeal [1, 2]. Subsequently, Judge Jimenez issued an amended decision. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal questioning the amended decision. The CFI issued an order (presumably dismissing the petition), from which the petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the remedy of certiorari or prohibition is proper against the amended decision.
2. W/N the Judge had the authority to pass upon the motion for reconsideration filed before the appeal was interposed.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appeal is devoid of merit because the amended decision complained of was appealable. Where the decision is appealable, neither certiorari nor prohibition is the proper remedy against said decision [2, 4].

2. **YES.** The motion for reconsideration was filed by the respondents before the original decision of the respondent Judge had become final and executory, and before the petitioners had interposed their appeal. The Court held that this sequence of events could not deprive the respondents of their right to press for the resolution of their motion, nor could it deprive the respondent Judge of his authority and duty to pass upon said motion in accordance with its merits [1, 2]. The Court cited *People v. Ursua* and *People v. Rodriguez* in support of this principle [2].

Accordingly, the order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [5].
