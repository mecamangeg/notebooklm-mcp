**I. CAPTION**
*IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. MARIANO NG also known as MARIANO UY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES*, G.R. No. L-21179, January 22, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Mariano Ng, a Chinese citizen born in Manila in 1932, filed a petition for naturalization. At the time of his amended petition in 1961, he was married and had two minor children. He worked as a sales manager in a factory owned by his brother, receiving a salary of P500.00 per month (P6,000.00 per annum) plus a year-end bonus. His total income for 1961 was P6,680.00. To prove his good moral character, Ng presented two witnesses who testified that they had known him since 1948 and 1951, respectively. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning the sufficiency of Ng's income and the competency of his witnesses [1-4].

**III. ISSUES**
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.
2. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner's irreproachable conduct.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that bonuses must be excluded when determining lucrative income because they are by nature indefinite and unsteady (*Tse v. Republic*). Excluding the bonus, Ng's annual income was only P6,000.00. Since he has a wife and two children to support, this amount is not considered lucrative. Even if the bonus were included, the total income of P6,680.00 remains insufficient for a married applicant with two children (*Tan v. Republic*) [4-7].

2. **NO.** Section 2, paragraph 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires proper and irreproachable conduct during the *entire* period of the applicant's residence in the Philippines. Since Ng was born in the Philippines in 1932 but his witnesses only came to know him in 1948 and 1951, they could not vouch for his conduct from his birth (or from his age of discernment) until 1948. The petitioner's own assertion of good conduct is insufficient to establish this requirement (*Chua Pun v. Republic*; *Dy Tian v. Republic*) [8-11].

**Judgment reversed. Petition denied.**
