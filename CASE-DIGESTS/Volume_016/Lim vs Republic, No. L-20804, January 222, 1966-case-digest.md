I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines: Felix Lim *alias* Lim Eng Pho v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-20804, January 22, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Felix Lim, a Chinese citizen born in Cebu City, filed a petition for naturalization on December 21, 1960. He finished his primary education at Cebu Chinese High School (now Cebu Eastern College) and his secondary course at the University of Southern Philippines [1]. He did not file a declaration of intention one year prior to his petition, claiming exemption under the law as a locally born applicant who completed primary and secondary education in the Philippines [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted his petition [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Lim failed to prove that his primary school was not limited to any particular race or nationality, a requirement for the exemption [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the filing of a declaration of intention is mandatory under Section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law), and failure to do so is fatal unless the applicant qualifies for exemption under Section 6 [2, 4].

To be exempt under Commonwealth Act No. 535, the applicant must prove birth in the Philippines and completion of primary and secondary education in schools recognized by the Government and *not limited to any race or nationality* [2, 5]. Here, Lim relied solely on his own testimony to prove that Cebu Chinese High School was not limited to a particular race or nationality [5, 6]. The Court ruled that his testimony, unsupported by other competent evidence, was inadequate to discharge the burden of proof required for the exemption [5, 6]. Since he failed to prove his entitlement to the exemption, his failure to file a declaration of intention warranted the denial of his application.

The judgment is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [7].
