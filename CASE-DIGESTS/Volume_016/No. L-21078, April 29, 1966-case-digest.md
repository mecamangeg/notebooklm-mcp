I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANTONIO L. CO FOR NATURALIZATION. ANTONIO L. CO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21078, April 29, 1966, Makalintal, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
Antonio L. Co, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Pampanga, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga [3]. The lower court granted his application on March 24, 1962, finding that he possessed all necessary qualifications, including proper moral character, education, and residence [3, 4]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision solely on the ground that the petitioner failed to satisfy the requirement of having a lucrative trade or occupation [3]. Co testified that his income was P200.00 a month, earned as the assistant manager of his parents' sugarcane farm [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's income of P200.00 a month constitutes a lucrative trade or occupation for purposes of naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the applicant's income of P200.00 a month, received as an assistant manager of his parents' sugarcane farm, cannot be considered lucrative for purposes of naturalization [5]. The Court relied on recent jurisprudence, specifically *Antonio Dy vs. Republic* (G.R. No. L-20348, Dec. 24, 1965), noting that the rule is well-settled and required no extensive review [5, 6]. Despite meeting other qualifications, the lack of lucrative income warranted the dismissal of the petition [4, 5].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition for naturalization is DISMISSED [5].
