I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. THE HON. SECRETARY OF LABOR, G.R. No. L-21321, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner PAFLU, a registered labor federation, filed an action for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Respondent Secretary of Labor [1]. PAFLU challenged the constitutionality of Section 23(e) of Republic Act No. 875, as amended by Republic Act No. 1941, which empowers the Secretary of Labor to inquire into the financial activities of legitimate labor organizations and examine their books to determine compliance with laws [2].

PAFLU argued that this proviso violates ILO Convention No. 87 regarding the freedom of workers to organize without interference [3]. Furthermore, PAFLU contended that the Secretary's visitorial power is merely an adjunct to the rights of union members under Section 17 of RA 875, and thus requires a minimum request of 10% of the members to be valid, similar to complaints filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [4]. The lower court ruled in favor of the Secretary of Labor. PAFLU appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Republic Act No. 1941 violates ILO Convention No. 87 on the freedom of association.
2. W/N the Secretary of Labor's visitorial power under RA 1941 is dependent on the 10% member request requirement found in Section 17 of RA 875.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held there is no conflict between RA 1941 and ILO Convention No. 87 [5]. The law does not authorize the Secretary of Labor to interfere in the workers' right to draw up constitutions, elect representatives, or organize their administration [6], [5]. RA 1941 simply restores the visitorial power the Secretary had prior to RA 875 to prevent the misuse of union funds [7], [6]. The authority is limited to an inquiry into financial activities to determine compliance with the laws, and the remedy for any abuse of this power is to challenge the specific action, not to invalidate the law itself [7], [6].

2. **NO.** The authority of the Secretary of Labor under RA 1941 is distinct from the rights of members under Section 17 of RA 875 [8]. Section 17 refers to proceedings before the CIR where members (at least 10%) report violations of internal procedures [9], [8]. In contrast, RA 1941 empowers the Department of Labor to inquire into financial activities to aid in the prosecution of violations, potentially in ordinary courts for crimes beyond the CIR's jurisdiction [10], [11]. This visitorial power is not dependent on any request from union members, much less the 10% requirement [12], [13], [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [14], [15].
