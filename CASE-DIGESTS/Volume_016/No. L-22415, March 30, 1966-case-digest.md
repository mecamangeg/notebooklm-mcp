**I. CAPTION**
**FERNANDO LOPEZ, ET AL. v. PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS, G.R. No. L-22415, March 30, 1966, 16 SCRA 431, Bengzon, J.P., J.**

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Senator Fernando Lopez, his wife Maria J. Lopez, and his son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Alfredo Montelibano, Jr., made first-class flight reservations with defendant Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) for a Tokyo-San Francisco flight scheduled for May 24, 1960 [1, 2]. Pan Am confirmed the reservations on March 31, 1960, and subsequently issued first-class tickets marked "OK" on May 21 and 23, which were fully paid [2, 3].

Unknown to the plaintiffs, a Pan Am employee mistakenly cancelled their reservations on April 18, 1960 [4]. Although the error was discovered the next day, Pan Am failed to reinstate the seats. Instead of informing the plaintiffs, the reservations supervisor decided to withhold the information, hoping for last-minute cancellations [5, 6]. Upon the plaintiffs' arrival in Tokyo, Pan Am informed them there was no first-class accommodation. Due to pressing engagements—a business conference for the Senator and a medical check-up for his wife—they were constrained to take the tourist class "under protest" [2, 7].

Plaintiffs filed a suit for damages in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. The trial court ruled in their favor, finding Pan Am liable for damages. Both parties appealed directly to the Supreme Court—Pan Am contesting the finding of bad faith, and plaintiffs seeking an increase in damages [8-11].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Pan Am acted in bad faith in breaching the contract of carriage.
2. W/N the plaintiffs are entitled to moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that Pan Am acted in bad faith. Bad faith is defined as a breach of a known duty through some motive of interest or ill will [12]. While the initial cancellation was an honest mistake, the subsequent willful non-disclosure of this fact to the plaintiffs constituted bad faith. Pan Am’s agents knowingly placed the airline in a position where it would breach its contract, motivated by self-interest to retain the plaintiffs as passengers and prevent them from seeking other airlines [12]. Furthermore, Pan Am issued tickets marked "OK" despite knowing the reservations were cancelled, misleading the plaintiffs [3].

2. **YES.** The Court modified and increased the damages awarded.
*   **Moral Damages:** Under Article 2220 of the Civil Code, moral damages are recoverable in breaches of contract where the defendant acted in bad faith [13]. The Court cited the social humiliation, wounded feelings, and mental anguish suffered by the plaintiffs, who were compelled to travel as tourist passengers despite their high official and social standing (Senator Lopez was Senate President Pro Tempore and former Vice-President) [14, 15]. The Court awarded P100,000 to Senator Lopez, P50,000 to his wife (considering her physical suffering), and P25,000 each to the Montelibanos [16].
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Pursuant to Articles 2229 and 2232 of the Civil Code, exemplary damages may be imposed in addition to moral damages when the defendant acts in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner [17, 18]. To deter similar future breaches by airlines, the Court awarded P75,000 [16, 18].
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Court upheld the P50,000 fee based on the written contract between plaintiffs and their counsel, finding it reasonable given the counsel's prominence and the extent of services rendered [19].

**Disposition:** The judgment appealed from is MODIFIED. Defendant is ordered to pay P200,000 in moral damages (divided among plaintiffs), P75,000 as exemplary damages, and P50,000 as attorney’s fees, with 6% interest [16].
