I. CAPTION
A. D. SANTOS, INC. v. CONCHITA VDA. DE SAPON, et al., G.R. No. L-22220, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Gervacio Sapon was a taxi driver for petitioner A. D. Santos, Inc. (City Cab), working seven days a week and almost 24 hours a day during his last five months of employment [1]. On September 21, 1961, Sapon sideswiped a child while driving, was detained by police, and released later that day [1]. He arrived home pale and was treated for a pre-existing heart ailment [1]. He was hospitalized on September 29 and died on October 3, 1961, of congestive heart failure due to arteriosclerosis [1]. The petitioner gave the widow P50.00 for funeral expenses but failed to file the required report of accident or disability with the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) [1, 2].

Respondents filed a formal claim for death benefits on January 8, 1962 [3]. The WCC awarded compensation, finding the heart ailment was aggravated by the nature of employment and the emotional disturbance of the accident [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the claim was filed beyond the three-month statutory period, the accident was due to the employee's notorious negligence, and the illness did not arise from employment [2, 4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim is barred by the failure to file within the three-month statutory period.
2. W/N the compensation is barred by the employee's notorious negligence.
3. W/N the illness and death are compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The claim is not barred. First, the petitioner failed to file the notice of accident required by Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which results in a forfeiture of the right to controvert the claim, including the defense that the claim was not filed on time [2]. Second, the employer's voluntary contribution to funeral expenses constitutes part payment of compensation, which tolls the delay in filing the claim under Section 24 of the Act [6].

2. **NO.** Section 4 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which denies compensation for injuries caused by notorious negligence, refers to injuries suffered by the laborer, not injuries caused *by* him to strangers (such as the child sideswiped by Sapon) [4]. Furthermore, the failure to report the death forfeited the right to set up this defense [4].

3. **YES.** Under Section 44(1) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, there is a statutory presumption of compensability that places the burden on the employer to prove the injury was not caused or aggravated by the nature of work [5]. The Court affirmed the Commission's finding that severe strain from excessive driving hours aggravated the deceased's heart condition, and the petitioner failed to overcome this burden [5].

The appealed decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** [7].
