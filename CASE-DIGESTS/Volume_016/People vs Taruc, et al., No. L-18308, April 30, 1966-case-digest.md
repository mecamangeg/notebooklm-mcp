I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LUIS TARUC, ET AL. (CENON BUNGAY, Appellant), G.R. No. L-18308, April 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 10, 1946, in Apalit, Pampanga, accused-appellant Cenon Bungay, together with other members of the HMB (Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan), plotted to kill Father Teofilo Limlingan. They believed the priest had abused women. Using the ruse that a couple needed to be married, the group tricked the priest into opening his convent door. They tied his hands, took him to a fishpond in Barrio Balucuc, and shot him. His body was dumped into the pond and covered with water lilies. In March 1947, skeletal remains were found in the fishpond, which were identified by the priest's sister through his height, gold molars, and a belt buckle with his initials.

The Court of First Instance of Pampanga convicted Bungay of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. The case against co-accused Luis Taruc was dismissed for insufficient evidence. Bungay appealed, arguing that the *corpus delicti* was not established because the body was not properly identified, and invoking double jeopardy as he had previously been convicted of rebellion with multiple murder, arson, and robbery.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution established the *corpus delicti*.
2. W/N the accused can invoke double jeopardy due to his previous conviction for rebellion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that *corpus delicti* was established. *Corpus delicti* means the fact that a crime has actually been perpetrated; it does not strictly refer to the body of the murdered person. The commission of the crime was proven by the testimony of three eyewitnesses. Furthermore, the identity of the victim was sufficiently established by his sister, who recognized the skeletal remains based on the victim's height, three upper right gold molars, and the belt buckle found with the remains [1].

2. **NO.** The defense of double jeopardy is untenable. First, the murder of Fr. Limlingan was not included in the information for the previous rebellion case where the appellant was convicted. Second, the Court found that the motive for the murder was personal—to punish the priest for alleged abuse of women—rather than political. Consequently, this specific murder was not absorbed by the crime of rebellion [2].

Decision affirmed.
