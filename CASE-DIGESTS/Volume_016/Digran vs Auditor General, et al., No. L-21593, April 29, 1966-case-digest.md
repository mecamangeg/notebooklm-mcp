I. CAPTION
RAYMUNDA S. DIGRAN, in her capacity as Administratrix of Estate of Deceased Ruperta Cabucos v. AUDITOR GENERAL, DEPUTY AUDITOR GENERAL, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS and CITY ENGINEER OF CEBU CITY, G.R. No. L-21593, April 29, 1966, 16 SCRA 764, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
In 1909, Ruperta Cabucos purchased Lot No. 638 of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate from the Government [1]. In 1914 or 1915, the Government constructed Mango Avenue (a public road) through the property without expropriation proceedings [2]. A Transfer Certificate of Title was issued to Cabucos in 1916 [1]. Following Cabucos' death, her heirs subdivided the property but retained Lot No. 638-B (the road lot) in the name of the estate [3]. In 1961, the estate's administrator filed a claim for compensation [4]. The Deputy Auditor General denied the claim, arguing that: (1) under Sections 19-21 of Act 1120 and Section 39 of the Land Registration Act, the title was subject to government reservations for public use; (2) the claim was barred by laches and prescription; and (3) the claim was not filed with the Claims Committee under Administrative Order No. 6 [5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the heirs are entitled to just compensation for the lot taken by the Government for road purposes.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Auditor General.

The Court held that the government's defenses lacked merit. **First**, Sections 19, 20, and 21 of Act 1120 (Friar Lands Act) do not authorize the government to take private lands for public use without just compensation [7]. **Second**, Section 39 of the Land Registration Act, which subjects titles to "subsisting" encumbrances, does not apply because the road was constructed *subsequent* to Cabucos' acquisition of the land in 1909 [8]. It would be unfair for the State to sell the land, collect the full price, and then take it back without compensation, as this abridges the constitutional right to private property [9].

**Third**, regarding laches and prescription, the Court applied the doctrine in *Alfonso v. City of Pasay*, ruling that a registered owner may bring an action to recover possession at any time [10]. However, since restoration of the land is not feasible as it is used for a road, the only available relief is just compensation [11]. **Fourth**, failure to file with the Claims Committee under Administrative Order No. 6 is not a bar to the claim because the Order did not provide such a penalty [12].

The Court awarded compensation based on the 1961 appraisal (P13,245.00) rather than the value at the time of taking, considering the long delay, plus interest and attorney's fees [13], [14].

**Disposition:** Decision reversed. Petitioner is ordered to execute a deed of conveyance in favor of the Republic, and the Republic is ordered to pay P13,245.00 plus legal interest and P1,500.00 attorney's fees [14].
