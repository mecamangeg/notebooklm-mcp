**I. CAPTION**
*ANGELES UBALDE PUIG, ET AL. v. ESTELA MAGBANUA PEÑAFLORIDA, ET AL.*, G.R. No. L-15939, January 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 28, 1949, Carmen Ubalde Vda. de Parcon executed a deed of donation in favor of Estela Magbanua Peñaflorida [1, 2]. The donor expressly labeled the conveyance as a donation *mortis causa* and stipulated that the deed should not be registered until after her death [2, 3]. Furthermore, the donor reserved the right to alienate, sell, transfer, or mortgage the donated properties to other persons at any time before her death [4]. The deed also contained a condition regarding a legacy to be paid by the donee to Caridad Ubalde, which would only arise if the donor had not transferred a specific lot by the time of her death [5].

The Supreme Court initially promulgated a decision on November 29, 1965, holding the donation to be *mortis causa* [1]. The defendants-appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the donor's reservation of the right to dispose of the property during her lifetime indicated that title had already passed to the donee, making it a donation *inter vivos* [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the deed of donation executed by Carmen Ubalde Vda. de Parcon is a valid donation *inter vivos*.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that the donation was *mortis causa* and thus void for failing to comply with testamentary solemnities [6, 7].

The Court reasoned that the donor expressly and consistently declared the conveyance to be *mortis causa* and forbade its registration until after her death [2]. Under Section 50 of the Land Registration Act, the prohibition on registration meant the deed did not convey title or bind the land until the donor's death [3].

Most importantly, the reservation of the power to dispose of the property at any time indicated that no proprietary right passed to the donee during the donor's lifetime [8, 9]. The Court distinguished this from a resolutory condition, noting that the donor's power was absolute and allowed her to destroy the donation immediately after execution [9]. Citing Manresa, the Court affirmed that where a donor reserves the power to revoke the disposition at will, the act is a disposition *mortis causa* requiring the formalities of a last will and testament [10, 11]. Since the deed did not follow these solemnities, the Motion for Reconsideration was denied [7].
