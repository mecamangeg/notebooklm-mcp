I. CAPTION
**INDUSTRIAL-COMMERCIAL-AGRICULTURAL WORKERS’ ORGANIZATION (ICAWO) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, CENTRAL AZUCARERA DE PILAR, and CENTRAL AZUCARERA DE PILAR ALLIED WORKERS ASSOCIATION (CAPAWA)**, G.R. No. L-21465, March 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner ICAWO staged a strike against respondent Central Azucarera de Pilar (the Central) in February 1956, which ended in an amicable settlement [2]. However, at the start of the 1956-1957 milling season, the Central refused to re-admit 101 seasonal workers belonging to ICAWO [3]. The Central argued it was bound by a closed-shop clause in its collective bargaining agreement with respondent union CAPAWA, which required "new employees" to affiliate with CAPAWA or be dismissed [3, 4]. The Central contended that the seasonal workers' employment terminated at the end of every milling season, making them "new" workers upon re-hiring [5]. ICAWO filed an unfair labor practice charge [3]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) trial judge ordered reinstatement with back wages, but the CIR *en banc* reversed the decision, ruling that the workers were new employees subject to the closed-shop provision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N seasonal workers in a sugar central are considered "new employees" at the start of each milling season, such that their previous employment is deemed terminated. [5]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that seasonal workers are not "new workers" within the scope of the closed-shop contract, and their discharge was illegal [6]. Citing *Manila Hotel Company v. CIR*, the Court held that the cessation of milling activities at the end of the season is not permanent or definitive, but merely a "foreseeable suspension of work" due to a temporary shortage of raw materials [7, 8]. The employment relationship is never severed but only suspended; during the off-season, the workers are considered on leave of absence without pay [7, 9]. Since they are regular seasonal employees, they cannot be classified as "new employees" subject to the closed-shop clause intended for future hires [6, 10]. The Resolution of the CIR is **SET ASIDE**, and the Central is directed to reinstate the 101 seasonal workers, with the issue of backpay remanded to the lower court for determination [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concurred by Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Concepcion, Barrera, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez; Justice Dizon took no part) [12].
