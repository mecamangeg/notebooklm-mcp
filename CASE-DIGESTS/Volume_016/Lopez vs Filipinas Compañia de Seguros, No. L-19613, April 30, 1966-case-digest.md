I. CAPTION
ALFONSO G. LOPEZ v. FILIPINAS COMPAÑIA DE SEGUROS, G.R. No. L-19613, April 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lopez obtained insurance policies from respondent for his truck and trailer. Following an accident, Lopez filed a claim for damages, which respondent rejected on April 28, 1960, due to alleged concealment of material facts (previous denial by another insurer). On May 27, 1960, Lopez filed a complaint with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner. After failing to agree on arbitration, Lopez filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila on September 19, 1961. Respondent moved to dismiss based on prescription, citing a policy condition that required an "action or suit" to be commenced within 12 months after claim rejection. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the claim had prescribed because the court action was filed 17 months after rejection.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint filed with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner constitutes an "action or suit" that tolls the 12-month prescriptive period stipulated in the policy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The filing of a claim with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner is not an "action or suit" within the meaning of the law or the policy. The Supreme Court held that the terms "action" and "suit" are synonymous and refer to the prosecution of a claim in a **court of justice** [1, 2]. Under Rule 2, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, an action is defined as an ordinary suit in a court of justice for the enforcement of a right [3].

Furthermore, the Insurance Law (Act No. 2427) does not empower the Insurance Commissioner to adjudicate disputes relating to an insurance company's liability to an insured. Matters involving the validity of a claim or interpretation of a policy must be resolved by a regular court [2]. Since the proper court action was filed only on September 19, 1961—more than 12 months after the April 28, 1960 rejection—the claim had prescribed [4].

The Order of dismissal is affirmed.
