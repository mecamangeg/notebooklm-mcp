I. CAPTION
MARTA A. VDA. DE CUIZON v. EMILIANO ORTIZ and THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20905, April 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Emiliano Ortiz was a share tenant of Petitioner Marta A. Vda. de Cuizon on a three-hectare riceland in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, since the 1944-45 agricultural year without a registered written contract [1]. On February 13, 1961, Ortiz sent a registered letter to Cuizon notifying her of his desire to change their tenancy relationship from share to leasehold tenancy effective the 1961-62 agricultural year, pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263 [2]. Cuizon did not agree to the change, prompting Ortiz to file a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [3].

In her answer, Cuizon challenged the constitutionality of Section 14, arguing it impaired the obligation of contracts, constituted class legislation, and deprived the landholder of property without due process [4]. The CAR ruled in favor of Ortiz, declaring the relationship a leasehold tenancy and fixing the rentals [5]. Cuizon appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, reiterating her constitutional objections [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263, is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263. The Court held that the grounds adduced by the petitioner—alleging impairment of contracts, class legislation, and violation of due process and social justice—had already been passed upon and rejected in previous decisions, specifically *Ramas v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, *Macasaet v. Court of Industrial Relations*, *Uichangco v. Gutierrez*, and *Gamboa v. Pallarca* [7]. Relying on these precedents, the Court found it unnecessary to elaborate further [7], [8].

The petition for certiorari is denied, and the decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
