I. CAPTION
**ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, THE NEW ZEALAND INSURANCE CO., LTD., and PHILEX MINING CORPORATION v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY**, G.R. No. L-21907, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 11, 1960, defendant Manila Port Service (subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company) received a shipment of 216 bales of cotton piece goods consigned to Philex Mining Corporation. The last package was discharged from the carrying vessel on July 12, 1960 [1]. The defendants failed to deliver 11 bales to the consignee [2].

A "provisional claim" was filed on July 14, 1960, which was within the 15-day period prescribed by Section 15 of the Management Contract. However, the "formal claim" specifying the value of the loss was only filed on September 9, 1960, which was beyond the 15-day period [1]. The insurers (Atlantic Mutual and New Zealand Insurance) paid the consignee and sued the defendants as subrogees [2].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the suit, ruling that the condition precedent in the Management Contract—requiring the filing of a claim within 15 days from the discharge of the last package—had not been complied with because the formal claim was late [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a provisional claim filed within the 15-day period, but without a statement of value or supporting documents, constitutes compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that a "provisional claim" filed within the 15-day period sufficiently protects the rights of the consignee, even if it does not specify the value of the goods lost and lacks attached supporting papers [3].

Citing *State Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Manila Port Service* and *Parsons Hardware Co. vs. De la Rama*, the Court reiterated that such a claim substantially fulfills the requirements of Section 15 of the Management Contract [3]. Consequently, the claim in this case was filed in due time.

The decision of the lower court was **REVERSED**, and the defendants were ordered to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P5,500.00 (based on the limited liability of P500.00 per bale for the 11 lost bales), plus costs [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, and Makalintal concurred. Justices J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez took no part [4].
