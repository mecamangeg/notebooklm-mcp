I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TAN HUY LIONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN HUY LIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21671, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Tan Huy Liong, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization on December 24, 1959 [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted his petition on October 21, 1960 [1]. Subsequently, the petitioner moved to take his oath as a Filipino citizen [2]. The Solicitor General opposed the motion [2]. The lower court found that Tan Huy Liong had left the Philippines in 1960, *after* he had filed his petition for naturalization [3]. Furthermore, while he testified to having resided at 16 Felipe Segundo St., Manila, he failed to state this former address in his petition, mentioning only his present residence [4, 5]. Consequently, the lower court denied his motion to take the oath [6]. Tan Huy Liong appealed the denial to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is disqualified from naturalization for leaving the Philippines after filing his petition.
2. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence in the petition bars naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner’s act of leaving the Philippines in 1960, after filing his petition, constituted a violation of Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [7, 8]. It also violated his promise in his sworn petition to reside continuously in the Philippines from the date of filing up to his admission to Philippine citizenship [7, 8]. Citing *Uytengsu v. Republic* and *Bun Tho Khu v. Republic*, the Court ruled that this violation compels the denial of naturalization [8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application [4, 5]. The petitioner admitted residing at 16 Felipe Segundo St., Manila, but omitted this address in his petition, violating Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law [4, 5]. The Court reiterated established jurisprudence that such an omission is a fatal defect [4].

**Orders affirmed.** Naturalization is denied [9].
