I. CAPTION
SOTERA VIRAY v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. GREGORIO LEGASPI and HEIRS OF CEZARIA MERENDO, G.R. No. L-25290, March 18, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sotera Viray received notice of the denial of her motion for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals on October 25, 1965 [1]. The 15-day reglementary period to appeal expired on November 9, 1965 [1]. Upon her counsel's petition, the Supreme Court granted an extension of 15 days "from the expiration of the reglementary period" [1]. Viray actually filed the petition for certiorari on November 26, 1965 [2]. The Supreme Court initially dismissed the petition for being filed out of time, as the extension expired on November 24 [2].

Viray moved for reconsideration, arguing that since November 9 was a holiday (Election Day), the first 15-day period should be deemed to expire on November 10 [2]. Consequently, she argued the extension should count from November 10, ending on November 25 (Thanksgiving Day), which would allow her to file on the next business day, November 26 [2].

Additionally, regarding the merits, the trial court had refused to admit Viray's amended answer which sought to withdraw previous admissions and change her theory of the case regarding the unauthorized abandonment of her certificate of public convenience [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari was filed on time.
2. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the amended answer.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition was filed out of time. The general rule that excludes the last day of a period if it falls on a holiday refers to the *performance* of an act prescribed or required [4]. It does not apply where, at the end of the period, no such act is to be done because an extension has been granted [4]. Since the extension was granted "from the expiration of the reglementary period" (November 9), the 15-day extension is computed from that date, expiring on November 24 [1, 2]. The holiday on November 9 did not shift the commencement of the extension period because the act of filing was not required on that day due to the extension [4].

2. **NO.** The trial court did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The refusal to admit an amended answer was proper because the amendment sought to withdraw previous admissions and change the theory of the case without adequate excuse for the delay [3]. Furthermore, the proposed theory—unauthorized abandonment of a certificate of public convenience—was in violation of law and could not be used to avoid statutory obligations [3].

The motion for reconsideration is DENIED [5].
