I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THOMAS FALLON AND ANNE FALLON MURPHY; MARTINIANO O. DE LA CRUZ v. EMILIO CAMON, G.R. No. L-21034, April 30, 1966, 16 SCRA 886, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The estate of Thomas Fallon and Anne Fallon Murphy owned a two-fourths (2/4) pro-indiviso share of Hacienda Rosario in Negros Occidental. Emilio Camon had been leasing the hacienda since before the intestate proceedings commenced in 1961 [1]. On October 23, 1962, the administrator, Martiniano O. De la Cruz, filed a motion in the probate court (CFI of Negros Occidental) seeking an order to compel Camon to pay the estate’s share of rentals for the crop years 1948-1949 through 1960-1961, totaling over P64,000 [2].

Camon challenged the jurisdiction of the probate court over his person, arguing that the demand for rentals could not be made by mere motion but required an independent action [2]. He also signaled he would raise defenses, including a claim that the administrator had already sold the estate's rights and interests to him [3]. The lower court ruled in favor of Camon, stating the demand must be by independent action [2]. The administrator appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court has jurisdiction to order a third-party lessee to pay alleged rental debts to the estate through a mere motion by the administrator.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court held that while the probate court has jurisdiction over the administration and liquidation of the estate, this power extends to property effectively in the hands of the administrator or "concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away" by persons cited under Rule 87, Section 6 of the Rules of Court [4, 5].

In this case, the money demanded (rentals) is not property in the hands of the administrator but a debt *to* the estate [5]. The amount is unliquidated, and the right to collect is "fluid" because Camon, a third party, is entitled to interpose defenses such as payment, statute of limitations, or lack of cause of action in a full-dress trial on the merits [3, 5]. Relying on the doctrine in *Paula v. Escay* (97 Phil. 617), the Court ruled that when the demand is in favor of the administrator against a third party not under the court’s jurisdiction, the remedy is an independent action, not a mere motion [6, 7]. The administrator cannot compel a third person to submit to the probate court's jurisdiction against their will [7].

The order of the lower court was affirmed [8].
