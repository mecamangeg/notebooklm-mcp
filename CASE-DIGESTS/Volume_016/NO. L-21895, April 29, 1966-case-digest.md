I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. AGUEDA GO (SIOK KING JO) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21895, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 29, 1961, Agueda Go filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte [1]. Although born in Malitbog, Southern Leyte, she spent her school years in Baybay, Leyte (primary) and Cebu City (elementary, secondary, and college), where she resided at No. 214 Manalili St. [2]. However, she failed to state these former places of residence in her petition [3]. The trial court granted the petition on May 11, 1962, dismissing the Solicitor General’s opposition that the omission was fatal because her stay in those places was merely temporary [4]. The Republic appealed. Pending appeal, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a motion to withdraw the appeal, which the Supreme Court denied [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to state her former places of residence in Baybay, Leyte, and Cebu City in the petition is fatal to her application for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the omission is fatal. Citing Section 7 of Commonwealth Act 473, the Court held that an applicant must state "all his previous places of residence, temporary or permanent" in the petition [3]. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate the public and investigating agencies in gathering information and expressing objections relative to the petition [3]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Qua v. Republic* that actual, physical residence must be set forth and published [5]. Finding no reason to depart from established jurisprudence, the Court held that the failure to include these residences warrants the denial of the petition. Consequently, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [6].
