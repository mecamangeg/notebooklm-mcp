**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF SUSANO SY TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. SUSANO SY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19581, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Susano Sy filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental [1, 2]. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision, maintaining that the petitioner did not possess all the qualifications required by law [2]. The records revealed that for the years preceding the petition (1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961), Sy’s income was P3,044, P3,328, P2,065, and P3,600, respectively, resulting in an average annual income of only P3,000.00 [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation to qualify for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that an average annual income of P3,000.00 is not considered a "lucrative" trade or occupation required for admission to Philippine citizenship [4, 5]. The Court relied on recent rulings in *Uy vs. Republic* (L-20208 and L-20799), which established that an applicant with an income of P3,600 per annum or P250.00 per month does not possess a lucrative income [5].

Consequently, the decision of the lower court was **REVERSED** and the petitioner's application for naturalization was **DENIED** [5].
