I. CAPTION
J. M. TUASON & CO., INC. v. ENRIQUE TONGOL, G.R. No. L-21877, February 28, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. is the registered owner of the Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision covered by TCT No. 42774 [1]. On December 5, 1957, defendant Enrique Tongol entered a 100-square-meter portion of the land without the plaintiff's consent [1]. Tuason filed an action for ejectment against Tongol.

Tongol argued that his occupation was legalized by a Compromise Agreement between Tuason and the "Deudors," a group claiming ownership of the area [2]. Under this agreement, the Deudors relinquished their claims but reserved the right for third parties—to whom they had sold possessory rights—to purchase the land from Tuason [2]. The specific lot occupied by Tongol was part of a 12.5-hectare area sold in 1949 by Agustin de Torres (a Deudor) to Julian and Toribia Lagman [3]. The Lagmans had merely given Tongol permission to occupy the lot and construct a house [3].

The Court of First Instance of Rizal ruled in favor of Tuason, declaring Tongol a mere intruder and ordering him to vacate and pay damages [1, 3]. Tongol appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on the legal question of the Compromise Agreement's applicability [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Compromise Agreement between J.M. Tuason & Co. and the Deudors legalized Tongol's occupation of the land.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's judgment [4].

The Court held that Tongol was a mere intruder because he was not one of the "third parties" for whom the reservation of the right to purchase was made in the Compromise Agreement [3]. The agreement reserved rights for those who had purchased possessory rights from the Deudors [2]. In this case, the purchasers were the Lagmans, not Tongol; Tongol only held the property by the Lagmans' permission [3].

Even assuming the Lagmans had the right to purchase, they never exercised it, nor did Tongol ever signify a desire to buy the lot for himself [3]. The Court distinguished this case from *Evangelista v. Deudor* (G.R. No. L-12826), noting that the petitioner in *Evangelista* was a direct purchaser from the Deudors who had made partial payments and signified a desire to buy the property [3]. Since the Compromise Agreement did not extend to Tongol, his possession remained illegal.

Judgment affirmed.
