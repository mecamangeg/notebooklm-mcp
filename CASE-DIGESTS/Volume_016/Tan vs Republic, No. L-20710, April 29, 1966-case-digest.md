I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF PEREGRINA TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. PEREGRINA TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20710, April 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Peregrina Tan, a Chinese citizen born in Cebu City in 1928, filed a petition for naturalization. She resided continuously in Cebu City, finished secondary schooling, and worked as a cashier earning P400.00 monthly [1]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted her petition [2]. The Solicitor General appealed on two grounds: first, that Tan failed to allege in her petition that she evacuated to Bantayan, Cebu during the war; and second, that her character witnesses, Francisco Balcon and Corazon Ceniza, were not credible [2, 3]. The Solicitor General argued Balcon was biased because he received "suitable prices" on hardware purchases through Tan's recommendation, and that Ceniza was biased because she was Tan's baptismal sponsor and dressmaker [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state the place of evacuation during the war in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the character witnesses are credible and unbiased.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The failure to allege the place of evacuation is not fatal [3, 6]. The Court reasoned that Tan was only 14 years old at the time and the evacuation was a temporary measure for personal safety, not a change of residence [3, 6]. This temporary transfer was not material for purposes of investigating her conduct or activities given her tender age and the short duration of the stay [3, 6].

2. **YES**. The Court held that the witnesses were credible [4, 5]. Regarding Balcon, the fact that he received suitable prices upon Tan's recommendation is a common business occurrence that does not connote undue favor or bias, but rather explains how he acquired knowledge of her character [4, 7]. Regarding Ceniza, the fact that she was a baptismal sponsor and that Tan patronized her shop does not disqualify her or prove bias; on the contrary, these circumstances afforded her ample opportunity to know the petitioner intimately and testify to her qualifications [5, 8].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [9].
