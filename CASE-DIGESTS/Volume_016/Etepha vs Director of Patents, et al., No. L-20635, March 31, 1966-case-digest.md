I. CAPTION
ETEPHA, A.G. v. DIRECTOR OF PATENTS and WESTMONT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., G.R. No. L-20635, March 31, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Westmont Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a New York corporation, applied to register the trademark "Atussin" for a medicinal preparation used in the treatment of coughs [1]. Petitioner Etepha, A.G., a Liechtenstein corporation, opposed the application, claiming that "Atussin" was confusingly similar to its own previously registered trademark "Pertussin" (Reg. No. 6089), also used for a cough treatment, and would damage its goodwill [2]. The Director of Patents dismissed the opposition and allowed the registration of "Atussin" [1, 3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trademark "Atussin" is confusingly similar to "Pertussin" thereby infringing on the latter.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that there is no confusing similarity between the two marks.

First, the Court noted that the root word "tussin" comes from the Latin "tussis" meaning cough [4]. It is merely descriptive and generic; thus, it is open for appropriation by anyone and cannot be used exclusively to identify one's goods unless combined with another word or phrase [5, 6].

Second, applying the "holistic test," the Court compared the trademarks in their entirety as they appear on the labels. Visually, "Atussin" is printed in horizontal plain block letters, while "Pertussin" is written diagonally upwards in a semi-script style with flourishes [7, 8]. The labels also differ significantly in color, content, and arrangement [9]. Phonetically, they are dissimilar because the prefix "Per" in "Pertussin" and "A" in "Atussin" sound different, and the first part of a word combination is usually the most pronounced [10].

Third, the Court considered the class of purchasers. The products are medicinal preparations dispensed upon medical prescription [11, 12]. The intending buyer must consult a doctor and present a prescription, making them less likely to be deceived than buyers of everyday articles [12]. Even if bought without a prescription, the buyer would likely be thoroughly familiar with the specific medicine needed [13].

The decision of the Director of Patents is affirmed [3].
