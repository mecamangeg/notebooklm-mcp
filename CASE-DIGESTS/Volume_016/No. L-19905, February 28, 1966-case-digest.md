I. CAPTION
VIRGILIO BRUA v. ENRIQUE INTING, G.R. No. L-19905, February 28, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Virgilio Brua was charged with Serious Physical Injuries in the Municipal Court of Davao City. He pleaded guilty upon arraignment [1]. On April 17, 1962, the trial court rendered judgment convicting him and imposing an indeterminate sentence [1, 2]. Immediately after the promulgation of the decision, Brua was returned to confinement without announcing, orally or in writing, any intention to appeal [3].

Ten days later, Brua attempted to appeal and posted a bail bond for his provisional liberty. However, Respondent Judge Enrique Inting refused to give due course to the appeal, ruling that the decision had already become final and executory because Brua had commenced serving his sentence [4]. Brua filed a petition for habeas corpus, certiorari, and mandamus with the Supreme Court, arguing, among others, that the proceedings should have followed Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code regarding suspended sentences for minors, claiming he was under 16 years old at the time [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment of conviction became final and executory, thereby barring the appeal.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to a suspended sentence under Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the decision had become final and executory. The record showed that after the promulgation of the judgment, the petitioner returned to confinement without making any announcement as to his intention to appeal [3]. The Court found that the respondent judge was correct in assuming the petitioner had submitted himself to the execution of the judgment [3]. Under Section 7, Rule 116 (now Rule 120) of the Rules of Court, when a convict begins to serve his sentence, the judgment becomes final and the right to appeal is deemed waived [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the application of Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code had been rendered academic [3]. At the time the Supreme Court resolved the petition, the petitioner was already 19 years and 5 months old [3]. This circumstance made the provisions regarding suspended sentences for minors inapplicable to him [3, 6].

Petition dismissed [7].
