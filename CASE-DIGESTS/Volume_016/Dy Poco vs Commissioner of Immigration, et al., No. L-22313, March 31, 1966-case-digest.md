I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME DY POCO v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION and THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER OF CEBU, G.R. No. L-22313, March 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bartolome Dy Poco was born in Cebu in 1910. Believing himself to be Chinese, he registered as an alien in 1947 and 1951 [1]. In 1952, he claimed he had made a mistake and requested the Commissioner of Immigration to cancel his alien registration, asserting he was a Filipino citizen as the illegitimate son of a Filipino mother and a Chinese father [1]. The Commissioner denied the petition, and the Secretary of Justice affirmed the denial because the mother's nationality and the petitioner's illegitimate status were not satisfactorily established [1]. When immigration authorities subsequently required him to secure an Immigrant Certificate of Residence, Dy Poco filed a petition for declaratory relief with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to determine if he was exempt from the duties of aliens under the Alien Registration Act [1, 2]. The CFI denied the petition, ruling that the issue of citizenship cannot be passed upon in a declaratory relief proceeding [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for declaratory relief is the proper remedy to secure a declaration of citizenship or exemption from alien registration requirements.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that a proceeding for declaratory relief is not the proper and available remedy to secure a declaration of citizenship, citing the ruling in *Santiago v. Commissioner* (G.R. No. L-14653) [3]. Although the petitioner argued the suit was merely to determine his duties under the Alien Registration Act, the relief sought was effectively a declaration of his Philippine citizenship [3].

Furthermore, the material facts upon which the petitioner based his claim—specifically his mother's citizenship and his illegitimate status—were disputed and had not been established [4, 5]. Under the prevailing rule, declaratory judgment is not available where the judgment would be determinative of issues of disputed fact rather than a construction of definite rights or status expressed in written instruments [5]. The Philippine Rules of Court do not authorize declaratory relief to try such disputed issues [6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
