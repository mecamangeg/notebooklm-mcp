I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PEDRO MACABUHAY**, G.R. No. L-19648, February 28, 1966, 16 SCRA 239, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On February 28, 1960, appellee Pedro Macabuhay, a bus driver, collided with a jeepney in Rizal, Laguna [1]. Two separate complaints for slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence were filed against him in the Justice of the Peace Court (Criminal Cases Nos. 107 and 108) [2]. After trial, the Justice of the Peace Court acquitted Macabuhay of these charges [2].

Subsequently, an information was filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna (Criminal Case No. SP-549) charging Macabuhay with serious physical injuries, less serious physical injuries, and damage to property through reckless imprudence based on the same incident [3]. The CFI quashed this information on the ground of double jeopardy. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that while the acquittal barred prosecution for the physical injuries, the charge for damage to property should proceed as it is a distinct offense [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the acquittal for slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence bars the subsequent prosecution for damage to property through reckless imprudence arising from the same vehicular accident.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order quashing the information. Under Section 9, Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court, an acquittal is a bar to another prosecution for an offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint [5].

The Court held that the essential elements alleged in the first complaints (slight physical injuries)—namely, the date and place, the reckless driving, and the collision caused by such recklessness—also constitute the essential elements of damage to property through reckless imprudence [6, 7]. Citing *People v. Narvas*, the Court ruled that when the offenses arise out of the same vehicular accident and rely on the same essential elements of reckless imprudence and collision, they are not distinct; thus, acquittal in one bars prosecution for the other [6, 7]. The Court distinguished this from *People v. Estipona*, noting that in the present case, the allegations in the complaints were sufficient to cover the elements of both offenses [4].

**Order affirmed.**
