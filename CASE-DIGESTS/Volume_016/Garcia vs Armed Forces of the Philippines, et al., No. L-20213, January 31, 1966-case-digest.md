I. CAPTION
MARIANO E. GARCIA v. THE CHIEF OF STAFF and THE ADJUTANT GENERAL, ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES, THE CHAIRMAN, PHILIPPINE VETERANS BOARD, and/or THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20213, January 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On December 1, 1961, Mariano E. Garcia filed an action for a sum of money in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan against the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and other government officials [1]. Garcia claimed disability benefits for injuries suffered during military training in 1948, alleging that the Adjutant General's Office unjustifiably denied his claim based on the repeal of Commonwealth Act 400 by Republic Act 610 [2]. The defendants moved to dismiss on grounds including lack of jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [3]. Garcia appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the money claim against the government.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal but on the ground that the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter [4]. The Court ruled that a claim for the recovery of money against the government must be filed with the Auditor General, in accordance with the principle that the State cannot be sued without its consent [4]. Under Commonwealth Act No. 327, the Auditor General has the authority to decide cases involving the settlement of accounts or claims within sixty days, and the aggrieved party may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court [5, 6]. Consequently, the rule applies that no recourse to the courts can be had until all administrative remedies have been exhausted [6].

The order dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED** [6].
