I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN T. PONCE v. HEADQUARTERS, PHILIPPINE ARMY EFFICIENCY AND SEPARATION BOARD, G.R. No. L-15471, April 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Benjamin T. Ponce, a reserve officer in the AFP with the rank of Major and over ten years of active service, was summoned by the respondent Efficiency and Separation Board in 1958 [1]. The purpose was to determine the mode of his separation or retirement because he had been "deferred twice" (passed over) for promotion [1]. Ponce filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, arguing that under Republic Act No. 1382, reserve officers with at least ten years of service could not be reverted to inactive status except for cause and after court-martial proceedings [2, 3]. The CFI ruled in favor of Ponce, declaring the Board lacked jurisdiction to investigate him [2]. The respondent Board appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a reserve officer with at least ten years of active service is immune from administrative discharge under Section 22(f) of the National Defense Act due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 1382.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Republic Act No. 1382 refers specifically to "reversion" to inactive status, which is distinct from "discharge" or separation from the service [4]. Reversion is merely a transfer from active to inactive duty, whereas discharge is a complete separation from the service governed by Section 22(f) of the National Defense Act (Commonwealth Act No. 1) [4, 5]. Under Section 22(f), the President has the discretion to discharge any reserve officer at any time [6]. The Court reasoned that extending RA 1382 to cover discharge would illogically place reserve officers in a higher category than regular officers, who are subject to administrative discharge upon recommendation of an Efficiency and Separation Board [7].

Decision reversed and the petition for prohibition is dismissed.
