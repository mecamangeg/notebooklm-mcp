I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF BENITO KO BOK TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. BENITO KO BOK v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21452, April 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benito Ko Bok, born in China in 1925, arrived in the Philippines in 1937. He filed a petition for naturalization, but the Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed it. The dismissal was based on findings that the petitioner: (1) did not possess the required ability to speak and write English and Tagalog; (2) lacked sincerity and candor due to material inconsistencies in his statements regarding his residence; and (3) presented character witnesses who were not competent to testify on his reputation. Additionally, the Solicitor General pointed out that the petitioner used the alias "Benito Ko Bok" in his 1956-1958 income tax returns and business dealings before securing a court order authorizing the name change in 1959. Ko Bok appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses the required ability to speak and write English and Tagalog.
2. W/N the petitioner's character witnesses were competent to testify on his conduct.
3. W/N the petitioner possesses the irreproachable conduct required for naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's finding that the petitioner's writings revealed a deficiency in the language. He could hardly write simple sentences in English, had great difficulty expressing himself orally, and his English statements often did not make sense. Furthermore, he failed to write Tagalog sentences correctly, omitting and misspelling words [4, 6].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses were deemed incompetent. Witness Ricardo Deocarega met the petitioner only in 1950 and 1954, meeting casually thereafter. Witness Rodrigo Blanco knew the petitioner only since 1950. Since the petitioner had resided in the Philippines since 1937, these witnesses had not observed him closely enough to testify on his proper conduct and behavior during the entire period of his residence [7, 8].

3. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner lacked the irreproachable conduct required to become a Filipino citizen. First, he made inconsistent statements regarding his residence dates and addresses in his petition, testimony, and sworn statements, indicating he was not very truthful [6, 9, 10]. Second, his use of the alias "Benito Ko Bok" without prior court authority was a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142, which constituted misconduct in his dealings with the Government [5, 7].

**Judgment affirmed.**
