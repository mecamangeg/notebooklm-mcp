I. CAPTION
HOSPITAL DE SAN JUAN DE DIOS, INC. v. PASAY CITY, PABLO CUNETA, R. N. ASCAÑO and G. C. FUENTES, G.R. No. L-19371, February 28, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Hospital de San Juan de Dios, Inc. paid electrical inspection fees totaling P1,709.50 to respondent Pasay City under protest. The payments were made because respondents Mayor Cuneta and City Engineer Ascaño refused to issue a building permit for the hospital's additional constructions unless the fees were paid. The applicable city ordinance (Section 5, Ordinance No. 7, series of 1945, as amended) imposes inspection fees but expressly exempts "buildings housing charitable organizations."

The hospital filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to recover the fees, claiming exemption as a charitable institution. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that while the hospital was organized for charity, it was not actually managed as such but for profit, and failed to prove it doles out charity.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is a charitable institution exempt from the payment of electrical inspection fees under the city ordinance.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.

The Court held that since it is undisputed that the hospital was organized as a charitable institution, the presumption is that it is operating as such. The burden of proof was on the respondents to show otherwise, which they failed to discharge. Evidence showed the hospital's Articles of Incorporation prohibited net income from inuring to private individuals, and it maintained free wards and beds for the indigent [1, 2].

The Court reiterated the doctrine that the making of profit or the charging of fees to patients who can afford to pay does not destroy the tax exemption of a charitable institution, provided such funds are devoted to the charitable purposes of the institution (*Jesus Sacred Heart College v. Collector*; *U.S.T. Hospital Employees Association v. Sto. Tomas University Hospital*; *Manila Sanitarium and Hospital v. Gabuco*) [3-5]. The paying beds are maintained to partly finance the expenses of the free wards [6].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is REVERSED, and appellees are ordered to pay appellant the amount of P1,709.50, with interest at the legal rate.
