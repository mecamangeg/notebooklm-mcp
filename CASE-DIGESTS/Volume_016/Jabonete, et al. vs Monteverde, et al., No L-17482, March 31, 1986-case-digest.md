I. CAPTION
**GENOVEVA R. JABONETE, ET AL., plaintiffs, vs. JULIANA MONTEVERDE, ET AL., defendants; ANTONIO LEGASPI, respondent and appellant, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, petitioner and appellee, MRS. LUZ ARCILLA, petitioner-intervenor and appellee, G.R. No. L-17482, March 31, 1986, Regala, J.**

II. FACTS
On March 11, 1954, the Court of First Instance of Davao decided in favor of plaintiffs Jabonete et al., declaring they had a right of way over the land of defendant Antonio Legaspi [1, 2]. Legaspi appealed, but the parties subsequently entered into an amicable agreement embodied in a Court Order dated May 24, 1954 [3]. Under this Order, Legaspi agreed to permit the use of his private street to the "plaintiffs, their family, friends, drivers, servants and jeeps" [4].

Years later, the plaintiffs' lot was foreclosed by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and subsequently sold to Mrs. Luz Arcilla [5]. Arcilla demanded that Legaspi re-open the fence to grant her passage, but Legaspi refused. DBP and Arcilla filed a petition for contempt. The lower court found Legaspi guilty of contempt for defying the court's decision [5]. Legaspi appealed, arguing that the right of way was personal to the original plaintiffs and did not extend to their successors-in-interest [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the easement of right of way established in the May 24, 1954 Order extends to the plaintiffs' successors-in-interest (DBP and Arcilla).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court held that the easement established by the Order of May 24, 1954 was a **personal servitude** under **Article 614 of the Civil Code**, not a predial servitude that inures to the benefit of the dominant estate [7].

The Court reasoned that the May 24, 1954 Order, which superseded the earlier March 11 decision, expressly limited the right of way to the plaintiffs and their "family, friends, drivers, servants and jeeps" [8]. It did not state that the right would pass to successors-in-interest [7]. Furthermore, the easement was granted without compensation to Legaspi, which is characteristic of a personal servitude [9]. Since DBP and Arcilla had no right under the personal servitude, Legaspi's refusal to grant them passage did not constitute contempt of court [7].

**Order reversed.**
