I. CAPTION
**PRIMO T. OCAMPO, ET AL. v. FRANCISCO DUQUE, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-23812, April 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were seven Special Counsels in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan who, by July 1, 1964, had served continuously and efficiently for more than four years [1-4]. On June 15, 1964, the respondent Provincial Board passed Resolution No. 598, abolishing petitioners' positions effective July 1, 1964, citing a "retrenchment policy" [5, 6]. However, on June 18, 1964, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4007 took effect, amending Section 1686 of the Revised Administrative Code [6]. This law granted permanent status to Special Counsels who had served for at least four years, providing they could only be removed for cause [7]. Despite petitioners' demand citing the new law, respondents excluded their salary items from the 1964-1965 annual budget [8]. Petitioners filed an original action for mandamus to compel the Board to appropriate their salaries [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the abolition of petitioners' positions was valid.
2. W/N mandamus lies to compel the Provincial Board to appropriate funds for petitioners' salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held the abolition illegal on three grounds. First, it violated **R.A. No. 4007**. Upon the law's effectivity on June 18, 1964, petitioners automatically acquired permanent tenure; Resolution No. 598, which was to take effect only on July 1, 1964, could not override the superior Act of Congress or remove petitioners without cause [10, 11]. Second, it violated **Section 2119 of the Revised Administrative Code** and the **Civil Service Law** [12]. These laws require approval from the Department Head (Secretary of Finance or Justice) for the abolition of positions or separation of employees, which was not secured [12]. Third, the abolition was done in **bad faith**. The claim of "retrenchment" was belied by the Board's approval of significant increases in other budget items (e.g., discretionary funds and new projects) far exceeding the amount needed for petitioners' salaries [13, 14].

2. **YES.** The respondents have **no discretion** to appropriate or not appropriate the funds for petitioners' salaries [15]. R.A. No. 4007 imposes a mandatory duty on the Provincial Board to maintain qualified Special Counsels in office and provide their salaries, which respondents are not at liberty to ignore [15, 16].

The petition is **GRANTED**. Respondents are commanded to appropriate without delay the amounts necessary for petitioners' salaries [17].
