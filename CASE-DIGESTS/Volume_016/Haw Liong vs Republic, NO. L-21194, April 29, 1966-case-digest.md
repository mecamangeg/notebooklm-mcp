I. CAPTION
HAW LIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21194, April 29, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Haw Liong, a resident of Tacloban City for over 20 years, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Leyte to change his name to "Alfonso Lantin." He testified that his Filipino friends have called him "Alfonso" since the Japanese occupation, that his father is named Placido Lantin, and that he desires a Filipino name to conform with local customs as he anticipates becoming a Filipino citizen. He arrived in the Philippines in 1925 and has no pending cases. The trial court granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing there was no valid justification for the change.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner presented a proper and reasonable cause to justify a change of name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a change of name is a privilege, not a matter of right. To be authorized, a petitioner must show proper or reasonable cause, such as when: (1) the name is ridiculous, tainted with dishonor, or difficult to write or pronounce; (2) the change is a consequence of a change of status; or (3) the change is necessary to avoid confusion [1].

The Court found Haw Liong's desire to adopt the name "Alfonso" based on the usage of friends and his alleged father's surname to be insufficient. His claim regarding his father, Placido Lantin, was inconsistent with the fact that his birth name is Haw Liong and that he had to file for naturalization [2]. Furthermore, in business dealings, he consistently signed as "Haw Liong" [3]. Citing *Ong Peng Oao v. Republic*, the Court ruled there was no compelling reason for the change.

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the petition is **DENIED**.
