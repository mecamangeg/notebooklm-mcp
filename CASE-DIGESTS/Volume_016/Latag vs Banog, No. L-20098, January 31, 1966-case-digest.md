I. CAPTION
SILVERIO LATAG v. MARCELO BANOG, G.R. No. L-20098, January 31, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On December 7, 1960, Silverio Latag and Marcelo Banog entered into a written contract whereby Latag would act as manager and caretaker of Banog's two parcels of land in Batangas for five years [1]. The agreement stipulated a crop-sharing scheme: two-thirds of the oranges and calamansi for Latag and one-third for Banog, while other products like coffee and bananas would be shared 50-50 [1]. Latag cultivated the land and built a house thereon, but on January 11, 1962, Banog allegedly ejected him and destroyed his house [2]. Latag filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas [1, 2]. Banog moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, arguing the case involved a tenancy relationship falling under the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) [3]. Latag opposed, amending his complaint to delete the word "cultivator," claiming he was merely a caretaker [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the complaint for damages arising from the alleged dispossession.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) has exclusive jurisdiction. The Court held that the contract and allegations established a "share tenancy" relationship, which exists when a person possesses another's land to cultivate it for a share of the crops [7]. The Court clarified that a "caretaker" of agricultural land is considered a "cultivator" [8]. Under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 1199 and Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267, the CAR has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases involving the dispossession of a tenant or disputes arising from the landlord-tenant relationship [9]. This jurisdiction applies even if the relationship has been terminated or if the action is limited to the recovery of damages for unlawful dispossession [9, 10].

The order of dismissal appealed from is affirmed [11].
