I. CAPTION
ANTONIA VDA. DE HUERTA v. DIONISIO H. ACOSTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20497, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The Government acquired the Fabie Estate in Manila through expropriation under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1162 for subdivision and resale to bona fide tenants and occupants. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) allocated Lot 14 (approx. 120 sq. m.) to petitioner Huerta and Lot 13 to respondent Acosta. Acosta obtained a Transfer Certificate of Title for Lot 13. However, Huerta had been occupying a 30-square-meter portion of Lot 13—where she constructed a house of strong materials and a septic tank—since 1947, long before the expropriation. Acosta never occupied this specific portion.

Huerta requested the LTA to adjudicate the disputed portion to her, but her request was denied. Acosta then filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover possession and ownership of the portion. The CFI dismissed Acosta's complaint and declared Huerta entitled to purchase the disputed land. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI decision, declaring Acosta the owner and ordering Huerta to vacate.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Huerta is entitled to purchase the disputed 30-square-meter portion of Lot 13 despite the statutory area limit.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 3 of R.A. No. 1162, landed estates are subdivided into small lots not exceeding 150 square meters for sale to tenants. Although adding the 30-square-meter disputed portion to Huerta's allocated Lot 14 would exceed this limit, Section 5 of the same Act provides an exception. Section 5 explicitly states that if a *bona fide* tenant has constructed *bona fide* improvements on the lot leased, their rights shall be recognized "the limitation as to area in section three notwithstanding."

The Court found that Huerta was a *bona fide* tenant who introduced permanent improvements on the land. Furthermore, Acosta never occupied the disputed portion. Thus, Huerta has the preferential right to purchase it.

Judgment reversed.
