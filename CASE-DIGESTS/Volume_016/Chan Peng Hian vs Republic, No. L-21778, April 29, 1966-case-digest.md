I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CHAN PENG HIAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHAN PENG HIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21778, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting Chan Peng Hian’s petition for naturalization [1]. Two years later, on October 30, 1962, Chan moved to set a date for the reception of additional evidence to take his oath of allegiance [1]. During this hearing, the lower court found that Chan had no lucrative occupation and denied his motion to take the oath [1, 2]. Chan appealed, claiming he was employed as a salesman at Huan Hieng & Co., a coffee and chocolate factory owned by his father, since 1956 when he was a 19-year-old engineering student [3, 4]. He alleged his salary rose from P2,370 per annum to P4,800 in 1961, plus significant bonuses, despite his duties remaining the same [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of having a known lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, holding that the petitioner’s employment was simulated [5, 7]. The Court cited the rule that employment by close relatives or in establishments owned by them is not convincing evidence of a lucrative trade unless there is satisfactory proof that the applicant is actually employed and worth the salary receiving [5, 8].

Here, the Court found the compensation unwarranted and "manifestly excessive" for an inexperienced student [3, 5]. The salary increases and large bonuses (P1,200 in 1961 and P4,000 in 1962) were granted without any increase in duties or business volume, suggesting they were designed merely to circumvent naturalization requirements [5, 9]. Furthermore, a comparison showed Chan received compensation equal to the firm's manager and significantly higher than long-time Filipino employees [6]. The Court also noted that filing income tax returns is not decisive proof of income when the employer is a close relative who can easily juggle records [10].

The order appealed from is hereby affirmed [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred with the decision [11].
