I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RODRIGO AGUSTIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18368, March 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The killing of Benito Labauan stemmed from a land dispute in Antique where he won a judgment involving the demolition of the houses of the accused. On July 13, 1960, days after the demolition began, Benito, his wife Emilia, and a companion were walking home. As they crossed Iglonoy creek, they were suddenly attacked by a group of armed men, including the appellants, who hacked Benito to death with bolos. Emilia was also wounded but escaped and later identified the attackers.

The Court of First Instance of Antique convicted Rodrigo Agustin, Arsenio Agustin, Julito Rizardo, Diosdado Apolinario, Adriano Apolinario, Conrado Apolinario, and Silverio Apolinario of murder qualified by treachery, while acquitting three others. The trial court credited the appellants with mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender, lack of instruction, and extreme poverty. Julito Rizardo, Silverio Apolinario, Conrado Apolinario, Diosdado Apolinario, and Adriano Apolinario appealed, relying on alibi and questioning Emilia's credibility given the acquittal of the alleged masterminds.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the guilt of the appellants was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite the acquittal of their co-accused.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstances of lack of instruction, extreme poverty, and voluntary surrender should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES** for appellants Julito Rizardo, Silverio Apolinario, Diosdado Apolinario, and Adriano Apolinario; **NO** for appellant Conrado Apolinario.
The Court ruled that the acquittal of co-accused Pedro Betudio and Pedro Agustin did not affect the evidence against the appellants. The widow, Emilia, positively identified the four appellants as those who chased and boloed her husband. Her identification prevailed over their alibis, which were weak and uncorroborated by credible evidence. However, regarding Conrado Apolinario, Emilia did not identify him during the trial or in her initial statement. The only evidence against him was the extrajudicial confession of co-accused Rodrigo Agustin, which is insufficient for conviction without independent identification.

2. **NO.**
The Court rejected all cited mitigating circumstances. 
*   **Lack of instruction:** This is not mitigating because it was not proven that the illiteracy was coupled with such a low degree of intelligence that the appellants did not realize the consequences of their criminal act (*People v. Ripas*).
*   **Extreme poverty:** This may mitigate crimes against property, such as theft, but not crimes of violence like murder (*People v. Macbul*).
*   **Voluntary surrender:** The appellants did not surrender; one was arrested, and the others went to the police only because they were summoned, not to voluntarily submit themselves to authorities.

**Disposition:** The judgment is **AFFIRMED** as to Julito Rizardo, Silverio Apolinario, Adriano Apolinario, and Diosdado Apolinario. Appellant Conrado Apolinario is **ACQUITTED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
