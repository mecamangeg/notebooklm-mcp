I. CAPTION
PEDRO F. NACIONALES v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18067, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pedro F. Nacionales sought to change his name to "Pedro F. Guarin." Although registered at birth and baptized as the son of Maximino Nacionales and Maria Guarin, he claimed his true parents were Vicente Guarin and Maria Ferrer [1]. He and his alleged mother testified that he was registered under the names of his uncle and aunt to break an "unlucky chain" of infant deaths that had plagued his true parents [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan granted the petition [1]. The Republic appealed, opposing the change.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner constitutes proper and reasonable cause to change his name based on his claim of true parentage.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision and denied the petition. The Court ruled that a change of name is a privilege, not a right, and requires a showing of "proper and reasonable cause" [3]. Here, the petitioner’s objective was to be declared the legitimate son of Vicente Guarin, effectively turning the name change proceeding into an action to claim legitimacy under Article 268 of the Civil Code [4, 5]. The Court held that such a proceeding affects the civil status and property rights of the surviving children of both the Guarin and Nacionales families, who did not consent to the petition [5]. Consequently, the correction of public and church records regarding parentage cannot be permitted upon such inconclusive proof [5].
