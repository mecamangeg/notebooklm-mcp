I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARTIN ALAGAO, et al., G.R. No. L-20721, April 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1962, the City Fiscal of Manila filed an information against the accused, members of the Manila Police Department, for the complex crime of "incriminatory machinations through unlawful arrest" [4]. The information alleged that the accused unlawfully arrested Marcial Apolonio y Santos without reasonable ground for the purpose of delivering him to authorities [4]. While Marcial was being investigated after the arrest, the accused allegedly commingled a marked P1.00 bill with the money taken from him to incriminate him for bribery [4].

The accused moved to quash the information, arguing that the facts charged did not constitute a complex crime but rather two separate offenses (unlawful arrest and incriminatory machinations), or that the court lacked jurisdiction because the individual crimes fell under the jurisdiction of the inferior court [5]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila granted the motion to quash, ruling that the two offenses were separate and independent acts, as the planting of evidence occurred "long after" the arrest [6-8]. The City Fiscal appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the information properly charges the complex crime of incriminatory machinations through unlawful arrest.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the information properly charges a complex crime because it sufficiently alleges that the unlawful arrest was a "necessary means" to commit the incriminatory machinations [9, 10]. Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, a complex crime exists when one offense is a necessary means to commit the other [11]. The Court found a close connection between the acts, noting that the accused had to resort to unlawful arrest to detain the victim and search his person, thereby creating the opportunity to plant the marked money [9, 12]. The lower court erred in assuming the planting of evidence happened "long after" the arrest; in a motion to quash, facts must be taken as alleged, and the information implied the acts closely followed each other [9, 13].

2. **YES.** The Court of First Instance has jurisdiction. Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for a complex crime is that of the most serious offense imposed in its maximum period [10]. The crime of unlawful arrest is punishable by *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500.00, which, when applied in the maximum period due to the complex nature of the charge, falls within the jurisdiction of the CFI [10, 14].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [14].
