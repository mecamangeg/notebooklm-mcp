I. CAPTION
CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-21139, April 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Central Azucarera Don Pedro, a domestic sugar milling corporation, removed and sold 4,218,749 liters of denatured alcohol from its distillery between October 1, 1947, and October 31, 1952 [1, 2]. Petitioner paid the specific tax on this alcohol pursuant to Section 142(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), which applies to denatured alcohol used for motive power [2]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed a deficiency sales tax of P40,522.86 plus surcharges, arguing that the alcohol was actually removed for industrial purposes—which is exempt from specific tax but subject to sales tax under Section 186—rather than for motive power [1, 3, 4].

The CIR’s assessment relied on a report by a revenue investigator who segregated the sales into two categories: alcohol denatured with gasoline (considered for motive power) and alcohol mixed with other denaturants (considered for industrial purposes) [5, 6]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling that the government's evidence was sufficient to overcome the statutory presumption that the alcohol was for motive power [7]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the evidence presented by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was sufficient to rebut the statutory presumption that denatured alcohol of 180 degrees proof is removed for motive power.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [8, 9].

Section 142(d) of the NIRC establishes a statutory presumption that the removal of denatured alcohol of not less than 180 degrees proof (90% absolute alcohol) shall be deemed to have been removed for motive power, unless shown to the contrary [10]. It is undisputed that the alcohol in question met this proof requirement [7]. The Court held that the investigator's report, which merely classified the alcohol based on whether the denaturant was gasoline or another substance, was insufficient to rebut this presumption [7].

The investigator's classification of non-gasoline denatured alcohol as being for "industrial purposes" was "conjecture pure and simple" and not supported by facts [11]. The law makes no mention of the kind of denaturant mixed with the alcohol to establish the presumption of use for motive power; it relies only on the alcohol's proof [12]. Furthermore, the burden of proof lies with the taxing authority to show the alcohol was used for purposes other than motive power [13]. Since the CIR failed to present evidence regarding the actual use of the alcohol—such as testimony from the purchasers listed in their records—the statutory presumption stands [13].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is reversed [9].
