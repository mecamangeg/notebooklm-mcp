I. CAPTION
ILUMINADO MOTUS and LOURDES LASERNA MOTUS v. HON. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL (Br. V, Quezon City), J. M. TUASON & Co., INC & G. ARANETA, INC., G.R. No. L-22120, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, spouses Motus, filed a complaint against private respondents J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. and G. Araneta, Inc. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal dismissed the complaint for stating no cause of action and denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration [1]. Petitioners then filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), deposited the appeal bond, and submitted a record on appeal [1]. Upon the defendants' objection, the CFI refused to allow the appeal to the CA, ruling that the case involved only questions of law and thus fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court [1].

Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus in the CA, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction [2]. The Supreme Court denied a review of the CA’s decision but stated the dismissal was "without prejudice to the filing of a petition for mandamus in this Court" [3]. Without seeking further action from the trial court, petitioners filed the instant petition for mandamus in the Supreme Court to compel the CFI to certify their record on appeal to it [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N mandamus lies to compel the trial judge to certify the record on appeal to the Supreme Court.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that mandamus will not lie where there is no refusal to perform a duty. The respondent Judge was never asked, and at no time refused, to certify the petitioners' record of appeal to the Supreme Court [4]. The Judge only refused to certify the record to the Court of Appeals, a ruling that had already been upheld by the appellate courts and attained finality [4].

The Court clarified that the reservation in its previous resolution (allowing a petition for mandamus) was based on the assumption that the lower court would refuse to elevate the records to the Supreme Court [3]. However, petitioners failed to take the requisite step of first asking the trial court to certify the record to the Supreme Court [3]. Since the trial judge was never given the opportunity to act on such a request, there was no refusal, and consequently, no ground for mandamus [4].

Petition denied [5].
