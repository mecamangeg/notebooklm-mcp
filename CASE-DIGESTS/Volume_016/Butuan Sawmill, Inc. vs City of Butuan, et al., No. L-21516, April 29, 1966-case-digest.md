I. CAPTION
BUTUAN SAWMILL, INC. v. CITY OF BUTUAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21516, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Butuan Sawmill, Inc. was granted a legislative franchise under Republic Act No. 399 in 1949 to operate an electric light, heat, and power system. Respondent City of Butuan enacted Ordinances Nos. 7, 11, 131, and 148, imposing a 2% tax on the gross sales or receipts of the petitioner's business. Additionally, the City passed Ordinance No. 104, which made it unlawful to disconnect electric wires without the consumer's consent, except in cases of fire, clear danger, or court order. Petitioner filed a case for declaratory relief, arguing the ordinances were unconstitutional and ultra vires. The City contended that its Charter (R.A. 523) and the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264) empowered it to levy such taxes. The Court of First Instance declared the tax ordinances unconstitutional and annulled Ordinance No. 104, prompting the City's appeal to the Supreme Court [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Butuan has the authority to impose a 2% gross sales tax on the petitioner's franchised electric business.
2. W/N Ordinance No. 104 prohibiting the disconnection of electrical wires is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The City lacks the authority to tax the petitioner. Under Section 2(j) of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264), the power to tax is specifically withheld regarding "persons paying franchise tax." Since the petitioner already pays a franchise tax, the City cannot impose additional taxes. The Court ruled that the logical construction of Section 2(d)—which mentions taxing public utilities "except electric light, heat and power"—alongside Section 2(j) is that local governments may only tax electric utilities that are *not* subject to franchise taxes [7, 8]. Furthermore, the petitioner's franchise (R.A. 399) is a special law, while the City Charter is a general law; the special law prevails and is considered an exception to the general law [9].

2. **NO.** Ordinance No. 104 is an unwarranted exercise of police power and is void. It deprives the petitioner of property without due process by effectively compelling it to supply electricity to consumers even if they do not pay their bills. The Court held that the general welfare clause does not justify such a measure, and jurisdiction over the supervision of public services and franchises resides with the Public Service Commission, not the City [8].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED [10].
