I. CAPTION
GIL P. POLICARPIO, et al. v. JOSE V. SALAMAT, et al., G.R. No. L-21809, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Damasa Crisostomo left a will bequeathing the naked ownership of a fishpond in Hagonoy, Bulacan, to her sister Teodorica de la Cruz, and the usufruct to the children of her three cousins [1]. The fourteen usufructuaries leased the fishpond to Gil Policarpio [2]. Teodorica bequeathed her rights to Jose V. Salamat [2]. During the lease, three of the usufructuaries died [2]. Salamat claimed the shares of the deceased usufructuaries, arguing that their usufruct rights were extinguished by death and merged with the naked ownership [3]. The surviving usufructuaries (Appellants) contended that the shares accrued to them [3]. The lessees filed a complaint for interpleader to determine who should receive the rent [4]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan ruled in favor of Salamat, holding that the usufruct was extinguished upon death [5]. The surviving usufructuaries appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the shares of the deceased usufructuaries accrue to the surviving usufructuaries.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Article 611 of the Civil Code, a usufruct constituted in favor of several persons living at the time of its constitution shall not be extinguished until the death of the last survivor [6, 7]. While Article 603 generally provides that death extinguishes a usufruct, Article 611 specifically governs simultaneous usufructs and establishes a right of accretion, preventing partial extinction [7]. This right applies unless the testator provides otherwise. In this case, the testatrix expressly enjoined that the beneficiaries should enjoy the usufruct "as long as they live," clearly implying that the share of any deceased usufructuary shall accrue to the survivors [8]. This interpretation is supported by Spanish commentators like Manresa and Del Viso [9, 10]. Consequently, the eleven surviving usufructuaries are entitled to the shares of the three deceased usufructuaries [11].
