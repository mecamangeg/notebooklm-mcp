I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BAUTIL PEDRO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18997, January 31, 1966, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On February 27, 1956, in Kauswagan, Lanao, spouses Emiliano and Francisca Momo, Agapito Tan, and others were traveling on a truck transporting copra [1]. They were ambushed by the accused Bautil Pedro, Florentino Cababa, Panontongan Amua, and Pantaran Macatamok [2]. Bautil Pedro fired shots at the truck, killing Emiliano Momo and wounding the driver, while the other accused, armed with guns, stood guard and robbed Agapito Tan of P1,800.00 and other valuables [2], [3]. The accused raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were elsewhere during the incident [4], [5], [6]. The Court of First Instance of Lanao convicted all four accused of Robbery with Homicide and Frustrated Homicide, sentencing them to death after finding the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident premeditation, in band, and uninhabited place [7], [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi is tenable.
2. W/N conspiracy exists among the accused despite the lack of a direct agreement.
3. W/N the penalty of death was correctly imposed on all appellants.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The alibis were weak and sufficiently overcome by undisputed evidence, including positive identification by the victims and the dying declaration of the deceased pointing to the accused [9], [10], [11].

2. **YES.** While there was no proof of a direct agreement, conspiracy was inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime [12]. The concerted action of the appellants—where Pedro fired the shots while his co-defendants, armed with guns, stood guard and demanded money from the victims—proved a common design making them equally liable [12].

3. **NO** (as to appellants Amua and Macatamok). The crime was Robbery with Homicide punishable under Article 294, No. 1 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act No. 12 [13]. The Court affirmed the presence of aggravating circumstances: commission by a band, treachery, and in an uninhabited place [11]. Consequently, the death penalty was correctly imposed on Bautil Pedro and Florentino Cababa [13]. However, the trial court erred in failing to appreciate the mitigating circumstance of minority for Panontongan Amua (16 years old) and Pantaran Macatamok (15 years old) [13]. This circumstance lowers the penalty by one degree to *reclusion temporal* [14].

**Judgment modified.** The death sentence is affirmed for Pedro and Cababa; Amua and Macatamok are sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of *prision mayor* to *reclusion temporal* [14].
