I. CAPTION
PEPITO LAO ALFONSO and JUANITO LAO ALFONSO v. HON. MARTINIANO VIVO, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of Immigration, G.R. No. L-20801, March 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Pepito and Juanito Lao Alfonso, born in China, applied for admission into the Philippines in March 1961, claiming to be sons of a Filipino citizen [1]. The Board of Special Inquiry (BSI) admitted them as citizens, and they were issued identification certificates [1]. However, on July 14, 1962, respondent Acting Commissioner of Immigration Martiniano Vivo issued a Warrant of Arrest against petitioners, stating that they were aliens who falsely represented themselves as Philippine citizens and were subject to deportation [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for "Mandamus with Preliminary Injunction" with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin the enforcement of the warrant, arguing that the BSI decision admitting them was final and that the respondent acted without jurisdiction [4, 5]. The CFI rendered judgment making the preliminary injunction permanent, enjoining the enforcement of the warrant but without prejudice to the respondent's right to proceed with deportation proceedings under the Immigration Act [6]. Respondent Vivo appealed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioner of Immigration may validly issue a warrant of arrest without the concurrence of the Board of Commissioners.
2. W/N the decision of the Board of Special Inquiry admitting the petitioners constitutes *res judicata*.
3. W/N the petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction was the proper remedy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 37(a) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 distinguishes between a warrant of arrest and a warrant of deportation [7]. A warrant of arrest is issued by the Commissioner of Immigration or any designated officer to apprehend undesirable aliens and initiate proceedings; it does not require the concurrence or approval of the Board of Commissioners [8]. Only the warrant of deportation requires a determination by the Board of Commissioners of the existence of grounds for deportation [8]. The warrant issued was not an order to deport but a command to bring the aliens to show cause why they should not be deported [9].

2. **NO.** Decisions of immigration officials do not constitute *res judicata* so as to bar the re-examination of an alien’s right to stay in the country [10]. The respondent is not precluded from reviewing the petitioners' status despite the prior admission by the BSI [10].

3. **NO.** The petition for "mandamus with preliminary injunction" is not the proper action [11]. The settled practice to test the legality of an alien's confinement and proposed expulsion from the Philippines is *habeas corpus*, which affords prompt relief from unlawful imprisonment and reaches facts affecting jurisdiction [12].

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed. The petition is dismissed and the preliminary injunctive writ dissolved [11].
