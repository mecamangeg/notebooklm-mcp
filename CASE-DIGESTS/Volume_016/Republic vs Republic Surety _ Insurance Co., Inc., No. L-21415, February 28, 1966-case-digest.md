I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. REPUBLIC SURETY AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-21415, February 28, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J. [1]

II. FACTS
On April 1, 1949, Republic Surety posted a bond for immigrant Yu Ngo [2]. On February 5, 1960, Commissioner of Immigration Emilio Galang declared the bond forfeited because the immigrant violated the bond's conditions [2, 3]. The Republic subsequently filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover the P3,000.00 bond amount [3]. However, on May 3, 1962, Acting Commissioner Agapito Conchu issued an order lifting the forfeiture and cancelling the bond [4]. Consequently, the Municipal Court dismissed the complaint [4]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the Commissioner had the authority to lift the forfeiture [4]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the validity of the Acting Commissioner's order given the lack of explicit approval from the Secretary of Justice [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Commissioner of Immigration has the authority to lift an order of bond forfeiture without the approval of the Secretary of Justice. [6]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that the Commissioner of Immigration has the power to lift a forfeiture [7]. Under the Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, the Commissioner has the authority to declare immigration bonds forfeited in favor of the government, as established in *Lee Suan vs. Galang* [6, 8]. The Court held that if the Commissioner may order a bond forfeited, he may also lift such order of forfeiture, as the latter power is a "mere corollary of the former" [6, 8]. Furthermore, there is no law or regulation that subjects either the forfeiture or the lifting of such forfeiture to the approval of the Secretary of Justice [6, 9]. The order of dismissal was affirmed [7].
