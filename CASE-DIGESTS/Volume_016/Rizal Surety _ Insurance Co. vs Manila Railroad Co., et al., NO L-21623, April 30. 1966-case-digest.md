I. CAPTION
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21623, April 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Rizal Surety & Insurance Company filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against defendants Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service to recover the value of undelivered goods [1]. Due to uncertainty regarding where the loss occurred, the plaintiff pleaded in the alternative: that the disappearance happened either while the shipment was in transit or while in the custody of the arrastre operator [2]. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction because the action was not one of admiralty and the amount sought (not more than P2,000.00) fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal court [1]. The trial court granted the dismissal, ruling that the suit was based on an arrastre contract involving an amount less than P5,000.00 [1]. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a complaint joining alternative causes of action for maritime loss and arrastre liability when the amount claimed is below the court's jurisdictional limit.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, a party may state in one pleading alternative causes of action arising from the same transaction; if any of said causes falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the CFI, the case must be filed in that court [3, 4]. Since the loss may have occurred during the voyage, the case involves a maritime/admiralty issue which falls within the original jurisdiction of the CFI, regardless of the amount involved [3, 5]. Citing *International Harvester Company of the Philippines vs. Aragon*, the Court held that because the cause of action is indivisible, the jurisdictional limitation regarding the amount must yield to the greater jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter for reasons of expediency and convenience [5].

The order appealed from was set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].
