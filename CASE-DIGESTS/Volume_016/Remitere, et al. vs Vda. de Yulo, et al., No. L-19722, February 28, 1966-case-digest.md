I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF VITO BORROMEO, DECEASED. DR. PATRICIO BELTRAN, Special Administrator. ATTY. FLORENCIO L. ALBINO, movant and appellee, vs. TOMAS L. BORROMEO and AMELIA BORROMEO, oppositors and appellants, G.R. No. L-19722, February 28, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Jose H. Junquera was removed as special administrator of the Testate Estate of Vito Borromeo by the trial court. While Junquera's appeal of his removal was pending, Dr. Patricio Beltran was appointed as interim special administrator [1, 2]. Without court authority, Beltran hired Atty. Florencio L. Albino to represent him in the Court of Appeals regarding Junquera's appeal [2]. Albino filed a memorandum for Beltran, even though Beltran was not a party to the appeal [3].

Subsequently, Albino filed a motion in the lower court for attorney's fees of P4,000, which the court granted over the opposition of the heirs (Borromeos) [4]. The heirs appealed this order [4]. Pending the appeal, the trial court ordered the partial execution of the order, directing the payment of P2,000 to Albino from the estate funds, which was immediately paid [3]. The appellants challenged the award and the partial execution [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the estate is liable for the attorney's fees of the lawyer hired by the special administrator to represent him in an appeal where he was not a party.
2. W/N the partial execution of the order awarding attorney's fees pending appeal was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the estate should not be liable for Albino's fees because his services did not assist the administrator in the execution of his trust [5]. Beltran had no standing in the appeal regarding Junquera's removal, as the issue was between Junquera and the moving heirs; Beltran's interest was entirely personal [3, 5]. Citing *Uy Tioco vs. Imperial and Panis*, the Court held that attorneys cannot hold the estate directly liable for fees; such liability rests on the administrator personally, who may only be reimbursed if the fees were beneficial to the estate and reasonable [5]. Here, Beltran's employment of Albino was not beneficial to the estate [5].

2. **NO.** The Court declared the partial execution void because it was authorized ten months after the appeal had been perfected [5]. The trial court provided no special reasons for the execution pending appeal, and there is no law justifying such action under the circumstances [5].

The order awarding fees was set aside, the order of partial execution was annulled, and Atty. Albino was ordered to return the P2,000 to the estate, without prejudice to his claiming fees from Dr. Beltran personally [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [6]. Justices Bautista Angelo and Barrera took no part [6].
