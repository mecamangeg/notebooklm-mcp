**I. CAPTION**
THE MINOR NGO CHIAO LIN, AS REPRESENTED BY NGO KEH v. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-21523, February 28, 1966, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Ngo Chiao Lin, a minor, arrived in the Philippines in June 1961 as a temporary visitor. In August 1961, his father, Ngo Keh, obtained a favorable judgment in a naturalization case. Subsequently, the Secretaries of Foreign Affairs and Justice, acting on a Cabinet resolution, changed petitioner's status to special non-immigrant and extended his stay until August 28, 1963, provided corresponding fees were paid. Petitioner paid fees only up to March 23, 1962.

In January 1962, the new Department Secretaries opined that the Cabinet resolution granting them concurrent jurisdiction to extend stays was void, as the law vests such power in the Commissioner of Immigration. Consequently, the Commissioner denied petitioner's request for indefinite extension and ordered him to leave by March 23, 1962. Petitioner filed a petition for prohibition, arguing the Secretaries' 1961 extension was a binding Presidential act. The trial court dismissed the petition.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Commissioner of Immigration validly ordered the petitioner's departure despite the previous extension granted by the Department Secretaries.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the temporary stay of aliens in the Philippines is merely a privilege, not a right, and is subject to the dictates of public policy and determination by the authorities vested with power under the Immigration Act [1, 2]. Therefore, an extension can be rescinded.

Even assuming the 1961 extension granted by the Secretaries was an act of the President (under the alter ego doctrine), the subsequent 1962 action by the new Secretaries—ruling that the power belongs to the Commissioner—is of equal validity as a Presidential act [2]. Furthermore, the petitioner failed to comply with the condition of the extension, as fees were paid only until March 1962, not August 1963 [3, 4]. Finally, the fact that the father's naturalization application was granted does not assist the petitioner, because an alien does not become a citizen until he takes the oath of allegiance after the two-year probationary period [5].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [6].
