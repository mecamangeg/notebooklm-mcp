I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. UNITED PHILIPPINE LINES, INC. and/or MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21546, March 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 521, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1961, United Philippine Lines, Inc. transported 16 bales of cotton remnants consigned to Vera Clothes, Inc. in Manila. The shipment was insured by Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company. Upon arrival on April 29, 1961, the carrier discharged the cargo to the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), in good order [1].

On May 3, 1961, the consignee’s broker filed a "provisional claim" with MPS for short-landed or bad order cargo. On May 16, 1961, MPS delivered the goods, but two bales were short by 138.4 pounds (valued at $48.44), as certified by MPS's own Bad Order Examination Report [2]. Atlantic Mutual paid the consignee for the loss and filed a suit for recovery as subrogee [3].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint. It absolved the carrier because the goods were discharged in good order. Regarding MPS, the lower court ruled that the "provisional claim" filed on May 3 did not comply with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract because it failed to state the nature and value of the damage, deeming it merely an advice of anticipated loss [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed by the consignee constituted substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a provisional claim constitutes substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract. Citing *State Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc. v. Manila Port Service*, the Court held that such a claim is not speculative when filed after the discharge of goods to the arrastre's custody and within the 15-day period required by the contract [5].

The lack of a specific statement regarding the precise amount of loss does not invalidate the claim. The purpose of Section 15 is to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of the claim while facts are fresh and documents are available (*Consunji v. Manila Port Service*). The provisional claim served this purpose. Furthermore, since MPS subsequently certified the loss in its Bad Order Examination Report, it is precluded from invoking Section 15 because the provision's objective had already been accomplished (*Republic v. Manila Port Service*) [6, 7].

Judgment appealed from is REVERSED. Manila Port Service is ordered to pay Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company the sum of $48.44 [8].
