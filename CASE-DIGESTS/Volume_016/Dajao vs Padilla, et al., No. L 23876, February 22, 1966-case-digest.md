I. CAPTION
URSULA C. DAJAO v. CHAIRMAN BENEDICTO PADILLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23876, February 22, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ursula C. Dajao, a Trial Attorney IV in the Legal Department of the Reparations Commission, sought promotion to a specific vacancy (Item 58) which she believed was next in rank to the Chief Trial Attorney based on the General Appropriations Act. The Commission, however, appointed respondent Cayetano Jacinto to Item 58 and offered Dajao a different vacancy (Item 60-2) with the same salary of P6,000.00. Dajao refused the offer, viewing it as a demotion in rank. Claiming the Commission violated the budgetary classification of positions, she filed a petition for mandamus and prohibition directly with the Supreme Court to compel the revocation of Jacinto's appointment and her appointment to Item 58. Respondents argued that budgetary laws do not classify positions and that Dajao failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the classification of positions in the General Appropriations Act (budget) is controlling regarding the rank and category of government positions.
2. W/N the petition for mandamus is barred by the petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the statement of positions in the budget proposal submitted to Congress is not controlling regarding rank or category. Budgetary laws are intended solely to set aside money for the support and operation of the government. The applicable and controlling statute for the classification of positions is the Civil Service Law, as implemented by the rules of the Civil Service Commissioner.

2. **YES.** Under Section 16 of Republic Act 2260 (Civil Service Law), the Civil Service Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals by persons aggrieved by an appointing authority. This administrative remedy is a condition *sine qua non* before an employee can take the matter to court. The Court ruled that Dajao’s failure to appeal to the Commissioner was a fatal flaw. Her claim that the Commission refused to explain the non-promotion was rejected as a valid excuse for non-compliance with the prescribed procedure.

Petition denied.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
