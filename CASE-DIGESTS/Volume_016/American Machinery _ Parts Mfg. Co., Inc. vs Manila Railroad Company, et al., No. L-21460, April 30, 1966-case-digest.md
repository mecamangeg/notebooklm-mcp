**I. CAPTION**
AMERICAN MACHINERY & PARTS MANUFACTURING CO., INC. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-21460, April 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiff American Machinery & Parts Manufacturing Co., Inc. was the consignee of eight shipments of merchandise discharged in Manila. Shortages occurred in these shipments, which were handled by defendants Manila Port Service (arrastre operator) and its parent company, Manila Railroad Company [1, 2]. For each shipment, the plaintiff filed "provisional claims" with the defendants within 15 days from the discharge of the last package (except for the first and fourth shipments), advising them of the shortages. These provisional claims did not state the exact value of the missing goods nor were they accompanied by supporting documents like invoices or bills of lading [3-5]. Formal claims with values and documents were filed later [3, 6, 7].

The plaintiff filed a suit for the value of the short-deliveries. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the provisional claims did not constitute a "claim for the value" as required by Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract [4]. The trial court held that because the provisional claims lacked specific values and documents, the plaintiff failed to comply with the 15-day prescriptive period for filing claims [4, 8]. Plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the provisional claims, which lacked statements of value and supporting documents, satisfied the requirement of filing a "claim for the value" within 15 days under the Arrastre Management Contract.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, holding that the provisional claims substantially satisfied the "claim for value" required by Section 15 of the management contract [9].

Citing *State Bonding & Insurance Company vs. Manila Port Service* (G.R. No. L-21833), the Court explained that a provisional claim is sufficient if it contains descriptions of the importations that allow the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to verify the goods in its possession [9]. The precise amount of indemnity and supporting papers may be reserved for the formal claim, which requires careful preparation. The primary purpose of the 15-day claim requirement is to afford the operator the chance to check the goods immediately after discharge [9, 10].

Since the plaintiff filed provisional claims within 15 days of the discharge of the last package for the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th shipments, the period of limitation was complied with for those causes of action [10].

**Disposition:** The appealed decision is REVERSED. Defendants are ordered to pay the plaintiff the value of the shortages for the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th causes of action [11].
