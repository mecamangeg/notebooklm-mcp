I. CAPTION
FAUSTINO SAN JUAN v. INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE SPOUSES JEAN SOCCHI and FRANCISCA PARELLADA, G.R. No. L-19467, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Jean Socchi (a naturalized Filipino) and Francisca Parellada owned agricultural land in Montalban, Rizal [1, 2]. They died in 1945, leaving heirs including Concepcion Parellada and siblings in Switzerland [2]. Due to their death and the heirs' absence, real estate taxes were unpaid from 1945 to 1955 [3]. The Provincial Treasurer sold the land at a public auction for tax delinquency to petitioner Faustino San Juan [3].

On March 27, 1956, within the one-year statutory redemption period, Visitacion Chacon paid the repurchase price to the Provincial Treasurer "for and on behalf of the heirs of Jean Socchi" [3]. This was done ostensibly on behalf of Frank P. Hill, who held a special power of attorney from the heirs [3, 4]. Petitioner San Juan protested the repurchase, arguing Chacon was a stranger with no interest in the property [5, 6]. Petitioner filed a suit to cancel the repurchase, while the respondent Estate filed a suit to enjoin San Juan from possessing the land [5, 7]. The Court of First Instance ruled against San Juan, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the redemption was valid even if made by a stranger, and that the alien heirs could validly redeem [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a stranger with no interest in the property may validly redeem land sold for tax delinquency on behalf of the taxpayer.
2. W/N alien heirs are prohibited by the Constitution from repurchasing agricultural land sold at a tax delinquency sale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 38 of Commonwealth Act No. 470 (Assessment Law) provides that "within the term of one year from the date of the sale, the delinquent taxpayer or any other person in his behalf shall have the right to repurchase the property sold." The law is clear that redemption may be effected by the delinquent owner or "any other person in his behalf" [10, 11]. It does not require the redeemer to be a party in interest or related to the taxpayer, nor does it require the money used to belong to the taxpayer [12, 13]. The only requirement is that the redemption is made in the taxpayer's behalf [13].

2. **NO.** (They are not prohibited; they may validly redeem). An alien who validly owns agricultural land in the Philippines may avail of the right to repurchase said land within one year under Section 38 of the Assessment Law [14, 15]. This right is an incident of ownership and does not fall within the constitutional prohibition against aliens acquiring land (Section 5, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution) or the Public Land Act [14, 15]. A tax sale does not immediately divest the owner's rights; ownership is only definitely divested after the failure to redeem within the period and the issuance of the final bill of sale [14, 16].

Petition denied [17, 18].
