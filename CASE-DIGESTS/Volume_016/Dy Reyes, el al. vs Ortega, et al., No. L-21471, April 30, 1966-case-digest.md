**I. CAPTION**
**VICENTE S. DY REYES, ET AL. v. FRUCTUOSO ORTEGA and NAGA CITY SHERIFF**, G.R. No. L-21471, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
In November 1960, respondent Fructuoso Ortega filed an unlawful detainer case against petitioner Vicente Dy Reyes in the Municipal Court of Naga City. Dy Reyes was not personally served with summons; instead, summons was served by publication in the *Bicol Examiner*. Consequently, Dy Reyes failed to appear and was declared in default. The Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering him to pay unpaid rentals and attorney's fees.

On January 10, 1961, a writ of execution was issued, and the Sheriff levied upon a gasoline station owned by Dy Reyes, scheduling the auction for January 19, 1961. On January 18, Dy Reyes filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Sur to enjoin the execution and set aside the judgment, alleging fraud and lack of notice as he was a resident of Manila. The CFI declared the Municipal Court judgment void for lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant due to defective summons. However, the CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the proper remedy was not a petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, but a separate action to enjoin execution or recover the property.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CFI erred in dismissing the petition for relief under Rule 38 despite finding the lower court judgment void.
2. W/N summons by publication is sufficient to acquire jurisdiction over the defendant in an unlawful detainer case.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI should have exercised its authority under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. The decision of the Municipal Court had not yet been executed when the petition was filed. The petitioners seasonably prayed to enjoin the execution and the sale. Furthermore, even if the sale had proceeded, it would not be definite until after the redemption period of 12 months under Rule 39, Section 30. Therefore, the remedy sought was proper and timely.

2. **NO.** An unlawful detainer case is an action *in personam*. The Court reiterated the doctrine that summons by publication cannot satisfy the requirements of due process regarding the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, except in actions *in rem* or *quasi in rem*. Consequently, the Municipal Court never acquired jurisdiction over Dy Reyes, rendering its proceedings and judgment null and void.

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is REVERSED. The decision of the Municipal Court of Naga City and the auction sale made in connection therewith are declared NULL and VOID.
