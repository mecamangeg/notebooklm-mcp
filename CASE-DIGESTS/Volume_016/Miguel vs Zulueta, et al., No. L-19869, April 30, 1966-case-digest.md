I. CAPTION
PATRICIO M. MIGUEL v. JOSE C. ZULUETA and RICARDO TANCINCO, G.R. No. L-19869, April 30, 1966, 16 SCRA 860, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On March 9, 1961, the Provincial Board of Iloilo passed Resolution No. 91 authorizing Governor Jose C. Zulueta to name the seat of the provincial government and its session hall. Governor Zulueta issued Executive Order No. 3-z naming the renovated session hall "President Garcia Hall," and Executive Order No. 4-z naming the provincial building "Provincial Capitol of Iloilo." However, the name "President Garcia Hall" was placed on the facade of the building, replacing the original inscription "Iloilo Provincial Building," while the directive in EO 4-z was not implemented.

Patricio Miguel, a taxpayer and resident of Iloilo, filed a petition for mandamus to compel the removal of the name "President Garcia Hall," arguing it violated Republic Act No. 1059, which prohibits naming public buildings after living persons. The respondents argued that Miguel lacked a cause of action and that the name referred only to the session hall. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo granted the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a taxpayer has the legal standing to file a petition for mandamus in this case.
2. W/N the placing of the name "President Garcia Hall" on the building's facade violates Republic Act No. 1059.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that where the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty—in this case, the observance of the law—the petitioner need not show any legal or special interest in the result of the proceeding [1]. It is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in question enforced, even without an exclusive right to be protected [2], [1].

2. **YES.** While naming the specific session hall "President Garcia Hall" may not violate the law per se, placing said name on the facade of the edifice, exactly where the name "Iloilo Provincial Building" originally appeared, violates Republic Act No. 1059 [3]. The location of the sign gives the impression that the entire building is named after a living person [4]. Mandamus is available to compel respondents to remove or rectify this unlawful act, as they are duty-bound to enforce the law [5], [1].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [6].
