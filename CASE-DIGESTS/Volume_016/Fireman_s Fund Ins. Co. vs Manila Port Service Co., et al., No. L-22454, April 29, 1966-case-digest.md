I. CAPTION
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE CO., ET AL., G.R. No. L-22454, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (petitioner) insured a shipment of 15 cases of nylon piece goods consigned to Getz Bros. & Company. The shipment arrived in Manila on July 4, 1961, and was discharged to the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (respondent), on July 7, 1961 [1, 2]. A provisional claim was filed by the consignee's broker on July 3, 1961, one day before the vessel arrived [2].

Within 15 days from discharge, the broker requested a "bad order examination" on July 20, 1961. The respondent’s inspector certified that three of the cartons were empty. A formal claim was subsequently filed on August 15, 1961 [2, 3]. After the petitioner paid the consignee for the loss and was subrogated to its rights, it sued the respondent [3].

The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the provisional claim was premature and speculative as it was filed before the goods were discharged. The trial court held that no valid claim was filed within the 15-day period required by Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the request for a bad order examination filed within the 15-day period constitutes sufficient compliance with the requirement to file a claim for lost or damaged goods.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While the Supreme Court agreed with the lower court that the provisional claim filed prior to the discharge of goods was premature and speculative under *Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. v. Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas* [5], the trial court overlooked the legal significance of the request for a bad order examination [6].

The Court held that the request for, and the result of, the bad order examination, which were done within 15 days from the haulage of goods, served the purpose of a formal claim. Citing *Consunji v. Manila Port Service*, the Court explained that the purpose of the claim requirement is to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of claims while facts are fresh in the minds of the persons involved [6]. The examination by the respondent's own inspector not only provided this opportunity but served as a verification of the respondent's own liability (*Parsons Hardware v. Manila Railroad Co.*) [7].

The appealed decision is reversed, and the respondents are ordered to pay the petitioner the sum of P1,500.00 [7].
