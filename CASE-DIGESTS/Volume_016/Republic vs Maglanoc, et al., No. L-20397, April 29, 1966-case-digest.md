I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Director of Forestry) v. HON. ENRIQUE MAGLANOC, COMMISSIONER OF LAND REGISTRATION, EUSTACIO DE LOS REYES and AUREA RAMOS, G.R. No. L-20397, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1922, the Court of First Instance declared Lot No. 20 of the Aurora Cadastre as public land via an order of general default [1]. Decades later, on April 21, 1961, respondent Judge Maglanoc issued an order upon the petition of respondent Eustacio de los Reyes setting aside the 1922 default order regarding Lot No. 20, admitting Reyes' answer, and authorizing the reception of evidence [1]. On May 26, 1961, the court rendered a decision adjudicating Lot No. 20 to Reyes based on claims of continuous possession since 1912 [2].

In April 1962, the Bureau of Forestry filed a petition for relief from the decision and for reopening, alleging fraud and deceit by Reyes, specifically for failing to notify the Director of Forestry and concealing that Reyes held the land under a Pasture Permit [3, 4]. The trial court denied this petition for relief in an order dated June 28, 1962 [3]. Instead of appealing this denial, the Republic filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on October 19, 1962, alleging abuse of discretion by the respondent judge [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the remedy of certiorari is proper to annul the trial court's orders and decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that certiorari is not the proper remedy where an appeal lies [5, 6]. The Court noted that the allegations of fraud and error raised by the petitioner were the same reasons advanced in the lower court in the motion for relief, which were overruled by the order of June 28, 1962 [7]. The petitioner should have appealed that order of denial. Having failed to do so, the order became final, and the petitioner cannot utilize certiorari as a substitute for a lost appeal [7, 8].

Accordingly, the petition is denied and the injunction dissolved [7].
