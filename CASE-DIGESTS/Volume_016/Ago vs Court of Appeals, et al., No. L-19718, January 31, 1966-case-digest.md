I. CAPTION
PASTOR D. AGO v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HON. MANUEL P. BARCELONA, BENITO MACROHON, VENANCIO CASTAÑEDA and NICETAS HENSON, G.R. No. L-19718, January 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Castañeda and Henson filed a replevin suit in 1955 against Petitioner Ago to recover a tractor, hoist, and truck used in Ago's logging business. In 1957, the trial court ruled for respondents, ordering the return of the machinery or the payment of P30,000, plus monthly rentals/damages until return or payment. Ago appealed. While the appeal was pending, the trial court issued a writ of seizure in 1958 because Ago's surety went bankrupt and he failed to file a new counterbond.

On January 5, 1959, the sheriff seized the tractor and hoist (the truck was missing). However, respondents refused to accept delivery because the machines were dilapidated and unserviceable. The sheriff reported he would return the units to Ago. Subsequently, the Supreme Court affirmed the main decision in 1961 (*Ago v. Castañeda*). When the trial court issued a writ of execution for P172,923.87, Ago moved to stay execution, arguing a "change in situation" occurred because he lost possession of the machines to the sheriff in 1959 and should not be liable for detention damages thereafter. The trial court denied the motion, stating the issue should have been raised before the judgment became final. The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondents had the right to reject the dilapidated machinery and the petitioner the obligation to accept its return.
2. W/N the execution of the final judgment should be stayed due to the petitioner's alleged loss of possession pending appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The prevailing party in a replevin case may refuse to take the litigated property if it cannot be returned in substantially the same condition. This right, established in *Kunz v. Nelson* regarding final judgments, applies equally to delivery *pendente lite*. Under Rule 60, Section 9, judgment must be in the alternative to provide relief when property cannot be returned. Furthermore, Rule 60, Section 6 implies that if property is not delivered to the plaintiff, the officer must return it to the defendant. Therefore, it was Ago's obligation to take the machines back upon the sheriff's tender. Whether he physically accepted them or not, he remained liable for their detention [1], [2].

2. **NO.** Generally, a court cannot stay execution of a final and executory judgment to allow parties to raise new issues. While the doctrine in *Chua A. H. Lee v. Mapa* allows a stay for circumstances arising *after* the case is remanded, this exception does not apply when the change in circumstances took place *while the case was pending*. The alleged loss of possession occurred in 1959, while the appeal was still pending (decided in 1961). Petitioner had no excuse for failing to bring this fact to the court's attention before the judgment became final [3], [4].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [5].
