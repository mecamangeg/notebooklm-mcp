I. CAPTION
**LY GIOK HA alias WY GIOK HA, ET AL. v. EMILIO L. GALANG, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-21332, March 18, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ly Giok Ha, a Chinese citizen, arrived in the Philippines in 1955 as a temporary visitor. In 1956, she married Restituto Lacasta, a Filipino citizen [1]. In a previous appeal (G.R. No. L-10760), the Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court to determine if Ly Giok Ha "might herself be lawfully naturalized" as required by Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law) [2].

Upon rehearing, evidence showed Ly Giok Ha was not disqualified under Section 4 of the law (e.g., not opposed to organized government, not a polygamist, not convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude) [1]. However, she failed to prove that she possessed the qualifications under Section 2, specifically: (1) continuous residence for 10 years; (2) a lucrative trade or profession; and (3) the ability to speak and write English or a principal Philippine language [3]. The Court of First Instance initially denied her petition but, upon a motion for reconsideration, modified its decision and declared her a Filipino citizen, ruling that she only needed to show she was not disqualified under Section 4 [4, 5]. The Commissioner of Immigration appealed [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen must possess the qualifications prescribed by Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law to be deemed a Filipino citizen.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The requirement of Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law that an alien woman married to a citizen be one who "might herself be lawfully naturalized" means she must not only be free from the disqualifications enumerated in Section 4 but must also possess the qualifications prescribed by Section 2 of the same Act [7, 8].

The Court reasoned that Sections 2 and 4 are not mutually exclusive. If the law only required the absence of disqualifications under Section 4, citizenship could be conferred upon persons violating the statute's policy. for instance, a person of bad moral character (required by Section 2) who has not been convicted of a crime (Section 4 disqualification) would otherwise be admitted [9, 10]. The phrase "might herself be lawfully naturalized" refers to the specific qualifications and disqualifications in the statute, not merely to racial or class restrictions which were eliminated by C.A. No. 473 [11, 12]. Since Ly Giok Ha admittedly does not possess the qualifications of residence, language, and lucrative trade required by Section 2, she cannot be deemed a Filipino citizen [13].

**Judgment reversed.** [14]
