I. CAPTION
MARCOS ESCOBAR, ET AL. v. HON. MODESTO R. RAMOLETE, ET AL., Nos. L-21851 and L-21924-26, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Marcos Escobar and his wife obtained a final judgment for ejectment against their tenants (private respondents) from the Municipal Court of Cebu City. The tenants were allowed to stay for two years [1]. Upon the expiration of the two-year period, the Escobars demanded restitution and obtained a writ of execution [2]. Respondent tenant Prudencio Bulahan filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu, presided by Respondent Judge Ramolete, alleging that a new lease contract had been concluded two months prior to the expiration of the original term [3]. Bulahan obtained a preliminary injunction from the CFI to stay the execution [3]. The Escobars moved to dissolve the injunction, but the Respondent Judge deferred resolution to first receive evidence on the alleged new lease [4]. Before the trial could proceed, the Escobars filed this petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court, alleging grave abuse of discretion and seeking to restrain the lower court from holding the trial [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition is premature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petition was filed prematurely and improvidently [6, 7]. The Respondent Judge could not resolve the motion to dissolve the injunction without first receiving evidence to determine the truth of the private respondent's claim regarding the existence of a new lease contract [7]. This factual determination is imperative and falls within the province of the lower court [7]. The filing of the petition for prohibition prevented the lower court from resolving this essential issue [6]. Consequently, the Supreme Court cannot determine the matter without the necessary evidence having been heard by the trial court [7].

Petition denied. Case remanded to the respondent court for further proceedings. The injunction issued by the Supreme Court is dissolved [8].
