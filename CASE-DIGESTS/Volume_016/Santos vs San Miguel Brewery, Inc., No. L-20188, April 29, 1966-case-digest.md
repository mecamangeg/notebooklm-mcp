I. CAPTION
PETER C. SANTOS v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, INC., COL. JOSE P. RUEDA and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-20188, April 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Peter C. Santos was dismissed from his employment as a temporary guard by respondent San Miguel Brewery, Inc. In CIR Case No. 647-ULP, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the dismissal to be an unfair labor practice and ordered his reinstatement as a "regular security guard" with backwages [1]. San Miguel Brewery appealed to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12682). On August 31, 1961, the Supreme Court modified the CIR decision, ruling that since Santos was only a temporary guard at the time of dismissal, he could not be reinstated to a permanent position he never held. The Court ordered his reinstatement to his former position of temporary guard, stating: "With this modification, the appealed decision and confirmatory resolution of the Court *a quo* are hereby affirmed" [2, 3].

Following this, San Miguel Brewery reinstated Santos but opposed his motion for the computation of backwages, arguing that under the modified Supreme Court decision, he was entitled only to reinstatement, not backwages [4]. The CIR agreed with the respondent, ruling on March 26, 1962, that the case was closed and Santos was not entitled to backwages [4]. Santos filed a petition for review on certiorari [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner Santos is entitled to backwages under the Supreme Court's modified judgment in the previous appeal (G.R. No. L-12682).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the previous decision in G.R. No. L-12682 modified the CIR's ruling *only* insofar as it directed Santos's reinstatement as a regular security guard instead of a temporary one [6]. The High Court expressly stated, "With this modification, the appealed decision... are hereby affirmed" [6]. Consequently, the portion of the original CIR decision granting backwages was affirmed and remained valid. Since that decision had become final and executory, there was no way to reverse or modify the award of backwages [6].

The Order and Resolution appealed from are hereby **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE** [7].
