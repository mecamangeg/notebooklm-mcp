I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIA (MARUJA) P. VDA. DE YULO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19645, April 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines, as successor to the assets of the Bank of Taiwan, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover the sum of P16,357.03 representing loans obtained in 1943. The complaint named Maria Vda. de Yulo, Luis F. Rivilla, and Mariano Pacheco as defendants [1]. The Republic alleged that Yulo, "for herself and through defendants Luis F. Rivilla and Mariano Pacheco," obtained the loans evidenced by seventeen promissory notes and secured by a chattel mortgage on Yulo's crops [1]. Rivilla filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of sufficient cause of action against him [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint against Rivilla, prompting the Republic to appeal [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint against Rivilla for lack of cause of action was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that Rivilla was not the real borrower [3, 4]. A review of the promissory notes attached to the complaint revealed that Rivilla signed them merely as an agent of his co-defendant, Maria Vda. de Yulo [4, 5]. The complaint itself admitted that Yulo obtained the loans "for herself and through" the other defendants [5]. Furthermore, the chattel mortgage securing the loans was signed solely by Yulo and was constituted on her exclusive property, corroborating that she was the sole debtor [4, 5]. Consequently, there was no valid cause of action against the agent, Rivilla.

The Order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [3].
