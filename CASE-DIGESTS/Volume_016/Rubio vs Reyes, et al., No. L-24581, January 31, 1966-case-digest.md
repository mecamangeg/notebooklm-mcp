I. CAPTION
MIGUEL PEREZ RUBIO v. THE HONORABLE SAMUEL REYES, ROBERT O. PHILLIPS and MAGDALENA YSMAEL PHILLIPS, G.R. No. L-24581, January 31, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Miguel Perez Rubio and others sold shares of stock of Hacienda Benito, Inc. to Robert O. Phillips and Sons, Inc. for P5,500,000.00 payable in installments [1]. The Phillips spouses eventually guaranteed the obligation [2]. When Phillips negotiated the sale of these shares to Alfonso Yuchengco, Rubio warned the parties that the shares were still subject to the unpaid balance of the sale price [2].

To prevent Rubio's interference, Phillips filed Civil Case No. 8632 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal. Respondent Judge Reyes issued an *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction restraining Rubio from interfering with the Yuchengco transaction or enforcing collection [3]. Rubio filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Supreme Court, alleging grave abuse of discretion, and obtained a preliminary injunction from the SC restraining the lower court proceedings and the sale of the shares [4, 5].

Subsequently, Rubio filed an "Amended Supplemental Petition" seeking to implead Victoria Valley Development Corporation and Manufacturers Bank and Trust Co., alleging they bought properties from Hacienda Benito, Inc., and praying for the return of said properties [6, 7]. Respondents moved to modify or dissolve the SC's preliminary injunction, arguing that Hacienda Benito, Inc. was not a party to the case [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Amended Supplemental Petition impleading additional parties should be admitted.
2. W/N the preliminary injunction should be modified or dissolved on the ground that the corporation (Hacienda Benito, Inc.) whose shares are the subject of the controversy is not a party to the case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court admitted the Amended Supplemental Petition. The Court held that the facts alleged in the petition were sufficient—if proven—to entitle the petitioner to relief against the additional parties named therein (Victoria Valley Development Corporation and Manufacturers Bank and Trust Co.) [9].

2. **NO.** The Court denied the respondents' *ex-parte* petition for modification or dissolution of the injunction. Although Hacienda Benito, Inc. was not a party respondent in the original or amended supplemental petition, its shares of stock and assets were the very subject of the controversy [8]. The injunction issued by the Court was directed exclusively to the parties involved, enjoining them from performing any act that would diminish the value of the shares or deplete the assets of the hacienda [8, 10].

Supplemental petition admitted [11].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Regala, Makalintal, and J.P. Bengzon concurred. Justices Barrera and Zaldivar took no part [11].
