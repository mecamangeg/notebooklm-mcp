I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ONG KIM KONG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ONG KIM KONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20505, February 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ong Kim Kong, a Chinese citizen born in 1937, arrived in the Philippines in 1947 and lived with his parents in Manila, where his mother owned "Tek Kong Grocery." He was a student until 1960. On June 26, 1958, he filed a declaration of intention, and on September 15, 1959, he filed a petition for naturalization. To prove lucrative income, he claimed he began working at his mother's store in July 1958—barely one month after his declaration of intention—with a salary of P2,400 per annum in 1959. His reported income increased in 1960 and 1961 due to a raise and bonuses. He presented two character witnesses, Domingo Tiangco and Irineo Mata. The Manila Court of First Instance denied the petition, doubting the bona fides of his employment and the sufficiency of his witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income to qualify for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner's character witnesses were sufficient to support the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the employment was simulated and not lucrative. The circumstances—employment starting shortly after the declaration of intention while the petitioner was a student living with his parents—gave rise to the inference that the employment was merely to qualify for citizenship; thus, the application must be rejected (*Sy Ang Hoc v. Republic*) [1]. Furthermore, income is reckoned as of the date of the application (*Ong Tai v. Republic*) [2]. At that time, his salary was only P2,400 per annum, which is not considered lucrative [2]. The bonuses received in later years are excluded from the calculation because a bonus is an act of liberality that is "indefinite and unsteady" (*Sia v. Republic*) [3].

2. **NO.** The Court found the witnesses incompetent to vouch for the petitioner. Character witnesses must be "insurers of the character of the applicant" and must have intimate knowledge of the petitioner (*Ong v. Republic*) [4]. Witness Tiangco's testimony negated the personal knowledge claimed in his affidavit, while Witness Mata's testimony regarding petitioner's high school graduation contradicted the documentary evidence (diploma) [5, 6]. This indicated they did not know the petitioner intimately enough to vouch for his qualifications (*Koh Chet v. Republic*) [6].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
