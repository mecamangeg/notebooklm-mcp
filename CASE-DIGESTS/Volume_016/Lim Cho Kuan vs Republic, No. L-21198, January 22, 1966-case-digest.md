I. CAPTION
LIM CHO KUAN alias MARIANO LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21198, January 22, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Lim Cho Kuan, born in the Philippines to Chinese parents, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention, asserting he completed his elementary education at the Philippine Chinese High School and secondary education at the Lyceum, both government-recognized. However, his petition failed to specifically allege that he was of "good moral character," although it stated he conducted himself in a "proper and irreproachable manner." The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, challenging the exemption and the sufficiency of the allegations.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention.
2. W/N the failure to specifically allege "good moral character" in the petition is fatal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law, exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention requires that the applicant received primary and secondary education in schools "not limited to any race or nationality." Lim failed to prove that the Philippine Chinese High School was not limited to any race or nationality; this cannot be presumed from the fact of government recognition alone [1], [2]. As the filing of the declaration is mandatory unless strictly exempt (*Tan v. Republic*), this deficiency is fatal to the petition [2].

2. **YES.** Section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law separately requires that an applicant (1) be of "good moral character" and (2) conduct himself in a "proper and irreproachable manner" [3]. The first requirement refers to personal quality and private life, while the second refers to public and social conduct [4]. A person's public conduct may be irreproachable while their private life renders their moral character objectionable [4]. Since the law distinguishes these requisites, "good moral character" must be alleged and proved separately [5]. Strict construction of the Naturalization Law requires the denial of the petition for non-compliance [6].

Accordingly, the decision is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [6].
