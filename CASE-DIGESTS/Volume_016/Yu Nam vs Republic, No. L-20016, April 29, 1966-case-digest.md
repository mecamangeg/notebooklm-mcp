I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. EMMANUEL YU NAM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20016, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Emmanuel Yu Nam filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Cebu, which subsequently granted the petition. In his petition and the corresponding publication, he alleged his name only as "Emmanuel Yu Nam." However, his birth certificate identified him as "Emmanuel Ong," and his school records listed him as "Manuel Ong y Lim." These other names were neither mentioned in his petition nor included in the publication of the notice of filing. The Republic appealed the decision, challenging the petitioner's use of aliases without judicial authority and the omission of these names in the proceedings [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to disclose and publish the petitioner's other names in the naturalization petition constitutes a fatal jurisdictional defect.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the omission of the petitioner's other names ("Emmanuel Ong" and "Manuel Ong y Lim") in the petition and its publication taints the whole proceeding to such an extent as to practically deprive the court of jurisdiction over the matter [1, 4].

The Court relied on the ruling in *Yu Seco v. Republic*, which established that the purpose of the publication requirement is to apprise the public of the pendency of the petition so that those who may know of any legal objection to it might come forward. If the notices do not contain all the names used by the petitioner, persons having derogatory information against the petitioner under a different name might not come forward, believing the applicant to be a different person. Since proper publication is a "primordial step" in naturalization proceedings, the misleading publication defeated its purpose [5-7].

The decision of the lower court was **reversed**, and the petition for citizenship was **denied** [7, 8].
