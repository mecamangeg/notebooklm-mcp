I. CAPTION
MANUFACTURER’S DISTRIBUTORS, INC. v. YU SIU LIONG, G.R. No. L-21285, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Manufacturer’s Distributors, Inc. (plaintiff) filed an action in the Municipal Court of Manila against Yu Siu Liong (defendant) to compel him to accept delivery of 74,500 pieces of plastifilm bags (the balance of a 100,000-piece order) and to pay the total value of P3,376.00, plus interest and attorney's fees [1, 2]. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the subject of the litigation was specific performance, which is not capable of pecuniary estimation and thus falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (CFI) [3]. The Municipal Court dismissed the complaint. The CFI affirmed the dismissal [3, 4]. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that because the bags had a specific price of P3,376.00, the case was capable of pecuniary estimation and cognizable by the Municipal Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court has jurisdiction over an action for specific performance to compel the acceptance of goods and payment of their price.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the Municipal Court lacked jurisdiction. The core issue was whether the defendant's refusal to accept delivery of the bags was justified, a matter plainly not capable of pecuniary estimation [5]. Under Section 88 of the Judiciary Act, Municipal Courts have no jurisdiction over civil actions where the subject of litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation [6].

The Court clarified that the prayer for payment of P3,376.00 did not make the case capable of pecuniary estimation because the payment was merely a consequence of the specific performance primarily sought [7]. Unlike in *Cruz v. Tan* (87 Phil. 627), where payment was an *alternative* prayer (specific performance OR payment), the payment here was not an alternative equivalent but a result of the specific performance; if no liability for specific performance is declared, payment cannot be awarded [8].

The order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [9].
