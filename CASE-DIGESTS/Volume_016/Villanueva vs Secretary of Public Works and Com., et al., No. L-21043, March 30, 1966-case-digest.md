I. CAPTION
APOLONIO VILLANUEVA v. HON. SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21043, March 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On April 20, 1960, petitioner Apolonio Villanueva filed a petition for injunction against the respondents regarding an alleged illegal construction, and a writ of preliminary injunction was issued the same day [1]. The respondents filed their amended answer on June 11, 1960, at which point the issues were joined [1]. However, for a period of over one and a half years, Villanueva failed to take any steps to set the case for hearing on its merits [2]. Consequently, on May 10, 1962, the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dismissed the petition, ruling that the unreasonable delay demonstrated a lack of interest in the cause of action [2]. Villanueva appealed, arguing that the delay was excusable due to the presiding judge's travel abroad, a clogged court docket, and the filing of new pleadings [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the petition for failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time was proper.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the failure of the petitioner to take any step towards the hearing of the injunction case for one and a half years showed a lack of interest and was sufficient ground for dismissal [2, 4]. The Court cited *Chuan vs. De la Fuente*, which established that failing to ask the court to set a preliminary injunction case for hearing for a similar period constitutes failure to prosecute an action for an unreasonable length of time [1]. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that Republic Act No. 2056 contemplates a speedy hearing and decision regarding illegal constructions in public navigable rivers, prescribing a maximum period of 90 days for such matters [3, 5]. The petitioner failed to substantiate his claims regarding the docket or show that he sought a transfer of venue or preferential attention [3]. The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
