I. CAPTION
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, ET AL. v. HON. LOURDES P. SAN DIEGO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22756, March 18, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Honda Giken Kogyo (Honda), a Japanese corporation, opposed the application of respondent Alfred Hahn to register the trademark "HM HONDA" with the Philippine Patent Office [1, 2]. Hahn moved to dismiss the opposition, arguing that Honda, being a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in the Philippines, lacked the personality to appear before the Patent Office [3]. When the Patent Office denied Hahn's motion, Hahn filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Civil Case No. Q-7864) [4]. Respondent Judge San Diego issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Director of Patents from recognizing Honda's capacity or continuing the proceedings [5]. Honda filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition, challenging the CFI's jurisdiction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction against the Philippine Patent Office.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of injunction against the Philippine Patent Office. The Court applied the well-settled rule that a writ of injunction, prohibition, or certiorari may be issued against a court only by another court superior in rank [7]. Under Rule 44 of the Revised Rules of Court and Section 33 of Republic Act No. 166, appeals from orders and decisions of the Director of the Patent Office must be taken to the Supreme Court [8]. Thus, the Philippine Patent Office is of the same rank or category as the Courts of First Instance, and the latter cannot issue injunctions against the former [8].

The petition is granted, and the orders complained of are set aside [9].
