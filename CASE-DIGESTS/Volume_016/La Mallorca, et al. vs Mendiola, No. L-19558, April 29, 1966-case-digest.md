I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA and PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY, INC. v. CIRILO D. MENDIOLA, G.R. No. L-19558, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On February 1, 1962, respondent Cirilo D. Mendiola filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate four (4) jitney (PUJ) units on the San Fernando-Guagua line in Pampanga [1]. Petitioners La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Company, Inc. opposed the application, arguing that their existing service was adequate and efficient, and thus there was no need for additional units [1].

On February 16, 1962, the PSC rendered a decision authorizing Mendiola to operate two (2) units [2]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, six exhibits submitted by the oppositors (reports on passenger volume) were lost by the PSC and could not be reconstituted [2, 3]. Consequently, the Supreme Court limited its review to determining whether the remaining evidence—primarily the applicant's—was sufficient to reasonably support the PSC's decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC's authorization of additional units is supported by substantial evidence.
2. W/N the petitioners can invoke the "prior operator rule."

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found that substantial evidence supported the PSC's conclusion that the existing units were insufficient to cope with the number of passengers [4, 5]. Passenger testimonies revealed that buses and jitneys on the line were usually loaded to standing capacity, often leaving people waiting along the route [6]. Even the petitioners' own witness admitted that private jeeps were hauling passengers, indicating a lack of authorized services [6]. Although there was a discrepancy among PSC Commissioners regarding the exact count of existing operators (10 vs. 79), this was not decisive; the controlling fact was the demonstrated public need and the overcrowding of existing units [5, 7, 8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioners cannot invoke the "prior operator rule" because they flatly denied the need for more units on the line in the first place [9, 10]. This rule applies only when an old operator offers to increase their service to meet an admitted increase in demand, not when they argue no such demand exists.

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [10].
