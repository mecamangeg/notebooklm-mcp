I. CAPTION
CHAN KIAN, doing business under the firm name of SHANGHAI TING TING SOY FACTORY v. THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-20803, January 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Chan Kian imported several bales and bundles of old newspapers. The Bureau of Customs seized the goods for non-compliance with Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code, as some bundles lacked Central Bank release certificates while others did not tally with the certificates presented [1]. The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the goods, but since they had been released under bond, he ordered Chan Kian and his sureties to pay the bond amount of P65,104.00 [1]. Chan Kian’s appeal to the Commissioner was dismissed for being filed out of time, a dismissal affirmed by the Court of Tax Appeals and the Supreme Court in a previous case [1]. Chan Kian then filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of Chan Kian, declaring Circulars 44 and 45 null and void and enjoining the Collector from enforcing the decision [2]. The Collector appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 are valid, rendering the goods subject to forfeiture.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s decision. The Court held that it has repeatedly upheld the authority of the Central Bank to issue Circulars 44 and 45 and affirmed their legality, citing *Bombay Department Store v. Commissioner of Customs* [2]. Merchandise imported in violation of these circulars acquires the status of "merchandise of prohibited importation" under Section 1363 (f) and (m) and 4 of the Revised Administrative Code [3]. Consequently, the goods became subject to forfeiture proceedings, and the Collector of Customs acted clearly within his powers in ordering the forfeiture [3].

The decision appealed from is reversed and the petition for prohibition is dismissed [4].
