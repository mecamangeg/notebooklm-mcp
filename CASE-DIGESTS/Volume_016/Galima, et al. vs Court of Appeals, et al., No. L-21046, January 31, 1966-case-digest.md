I. CAPTION
SINFOROSO GALIMA, ET AL. v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., No. L-21046, January 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Galima, et al. were the defendants in Civil Cases Nos. U-234 and U-435 before the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan. The trial court rendered judgment ordering them to deliver a parcel of land and pay a sum of money to the plaintiff [1]. The 30-day reglementary period for appeal expired on March 1, 1962 [2]. However, petitioners filed their motion for extension of time to file the record on appeal only on March 2, 1962, one day late [2].

Judge Pabalan initially granted the extension, but Judge Santiago subsequently set aside that order, dismissed the appeal, and ordered the execution of the judgment [2, 3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals, claiming excusable mistake by counsel and arguing that the trial court had discretion to allow the appeal on equitable grounds [2, 4]. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, ruling that the trial court lost jurisdiction when the period lapsed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may validly grant a motion for extension of time to file the record on appeal when such motion is filed after the expiration of the reglementary period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The perfection of an appeal within the period prescribed by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional [5]. While the court has the discretion to extend the period for filing the record on appeal, this power is conditioned upon the application for extension being filed *prior* to the expiration of the period fixed by law [5].

Since the petitioners' motion was filed one day after the 30-day period expired, the judgment had already become final, and the court lost all jurisdiction over the case except to order execution [6]. The Court held that miscomputation by counsel does not arrest the course of the appeal period nor prevent the finality of judgment [7]. The Court further expressly declared that the ruling in *Santiago v. Valenzuela*, which previously allowed discretion in such matters, has been abandoned and overruled by subsequent jurisprudence, such as *Miranda v. Guanzon* [8].

The petition for review is denied, and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [8].
