I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. AMANDO M. PEREZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20412, February 28, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On March 22, 1961, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila to revive a judgment rendered on December 29, 1949, against Amando Perez and the Pumuntocs [2]. The defendants failed to answer and were declared in default [3]. PNB was allowed to present evidence, which established that the 1949 judgment became final on February 2, 1950 [4]. However, the trial court dismissed the complaint *motu proprio* on the ground that PNB’s cause of action had prescribed under Articles 1144 and 1152 of the Civil Code [3]. PNB appealed, contending that the court could not consider prescription as it was not raised as a defense by the defaulting defendants [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may dismiss the action on the ground of prescription even if the defense was not pleaded by the defendants. [5]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the defense of prescription generally must be invoked by the defendant, this rule does not apply when the plaintiff's own evidence shows that the action is already barred [5]. Under Articles 1144 and 1152 of the Civil Code, an action to enforce a judgment must be brought within 10 years from the time the judgment becomes final [6, 7]. The evidence presented by PNB showed that the judgment became final on February 2, 1950, while the action for revival was filed only on March 22, 1961—a lapse of more than 11 years [4, 5]. Consequently, the action was barred by the statute of limitations [7].

The Order of dismissal is affirmed [1].
