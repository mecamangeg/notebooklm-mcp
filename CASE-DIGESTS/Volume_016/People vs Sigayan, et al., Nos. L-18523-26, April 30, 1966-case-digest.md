I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BALBAL SIGAYAN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-18523-26, April 30, 1966, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On January 8, 1955, at around 8:00 PM in Sitio Kalubihon, Dalipuga, Iligan City, a band of armed men led by Makasiro Tamiara, which included accused-appellant Balbal Sigayan, riddled the houses of Anacleto Madrina and Leodegario Mendez with bullets. The strafing resulted in the deaths of Anacleto, his daughters Juana and Elena, Leodegario Mendez, and Laureano Alongay [1, 2]. The band then robbed the Madrina home of cash and firearms worth P3,050.00 [2]. Sigayan was captured after an encounter with the police [3].

The Court of First Instance of Lanao convicted Sigayan of Robbery with Homicide (Criminal Cases Nos. 1690 and 1797) and sentenced him to death. He was also convicted of two counts of Murder in separate cases but did not appeal those verdicts [4]. The death penalty cases were elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review [4]. Sigayan claimed he was merely forced at gunpoint to carry the band's loot and that he voluntarily surrendered to the mayor [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of the crime charged despite his claim of coercion.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, relying on the credibility of state witness Demasendel Timba, who testified that Sigayan was armed and actively participated in the crime [7]. Timba's testimony was clear, convincing, and corroborated by the Provincial Commander and the Justice of the Peace who attested to Sigayan’s written declaration [7]. The claim of coercion was rejected as it was based solely on Sigayan's uncorroborated testimony, which contradicted the physical evidence and witness accounts [7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the surrender was not voluntary. The records established that Sigayan gave up only after he was surrounded by constabulary and police forces and had no other alternative but to surrender [8]. For voluntary surrender to be mitigating, it must be spontaneous and not forced by circumstances where capture is imminent [8, 9].

The Court affirmed the death penalty, finding the crime aggravated by dwelling, band, evident premeditation, and treachery [10]. The judgment of the trial court is **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [10].
