I. CAPTION
THE SPOUSES BERNABE AFRICA and SOLEDAD C. AFRICA, and the HEIRS OF DOMINGA ONG v. CALTEX (PHIL.), INC., MATEO BOQUIREN and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-12986, March 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the afternoon of March 18, 1948, a fire broke out at a Caltex service station in Manila while gasoline was being transferred from a tank truck into an underground storage tank. The fire spread to and burned the neighboring houses owned by petitioners Bernabe Africa and the Heirs of Dominga Ong. Petitioners sued respondents Caltex (the alleged owner of the station) and Mateo Boquiren (the agent in charge) for damages based on quasi-delict. The trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint, ruling that the petitioners failed to prove negligence. The lower courts excluded police and fire department reports—which attributed the fire to a cigarette thrown by a stranger—as inadmissible hearsay.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the police and fire department reports are admissible as evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule.
2. W/N the doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* applies to create a presumption of negligence against the respondents.
3. W/N Caltex is liable for the damages caused by the fire.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The reports regarding the specific cause of the fire (e.g., the lighted cigarette) are inadmissible hearsay. Under **Section 35, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court** (Entries in official records), three requisites must be met: (a) the entry was made by a public officer in the performance of duty; (b) the officer had sufficient knowledge of the facts; and (c) such knowledge was acquired personally or through official information. Here, the reporting officers had no personal knowledge of the fire's origin and relied on information from bystanders who had no legal duty to report. However, the portion of the police report describing the physical layout and hazardous conditions of the station, based on the officer's personal observation, is admissible.

2. **YES.** The doctrine of ***res ipsa loquitur*** applies. Where the thing causing the injury is under the exclusive control of the defendant and the accident is one that does not ordinarily happen if proper care is used, negligence is presumed in the absence of an explanation. The station and equipment were under the control of the respondents, and the fire occurred during the dangerous process of transferring gasoline. Respondents failed to explain the cause. Even if a stranger triggered the fire, the respondents were negligent for failing to install a concrete wall high enough to prevent the flames from spreading to neighboring properties. The intervention of an unforeseen cause does not relieve a wrongdoer if their negligence (e.g., inadequate safety measures) directly cooperates with the independent cause.

3. **YES.** Caltex is liable because Boquiren was an agent, not an independent contractor. While the contract was labeled a "license agreement," Caltex owned the station and equipment, fixed product prices, supervised the operator, and retained the right to terminate the contract at will. These factors demonstrate Caltex's control over the operations. Consequently, Caltex is vicariously liable for the negligence of its agent.

The decision is **REVERSED**, and respondents are held solidarily liable to pay damages to the petitioners.
