I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. RAYMUNDO DE VILLA, G.R. No. L-19114, March 18, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 29, 1959, at around 6:30 A.M. in Talisay, Batangas, a bus driven by Modesto Malabanan was forced to stop due to tree branches blocking the road. The conductor, Bonifacio Umandal, and passenger Agripino Reyes alighted to clear the obstruction. Suddenly, gunshots were fired, killing Umandal. Malabanan and Reyes saw the accused, Raymundo De Villa, about five meters away holding a carbine and challenging the male passengers to face him before he fled.

Upon his apprehension on August 12, 1959, De Villa executed a sworn statement before the Justice of the Peace admitting to the killing and pointing to the location of the murder weapon. The recovered carbine matched the empty shells found at the crime scene via ballistics examination. The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted De Villa of murder with treachery and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. De Villa appealed, claiming his confession was involuntary because it was made at night, and interposed the defense of alibi.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused's extrajudicial confession was voluntary and his guilt proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction. The accused's claim that his confession was involuntary solely because it was made at night is self-serving and untenable. The confession was fully corroborated by the positive identification of prosecution witnesses Malabanan and Reyes, who knew the accused personally and had no ill motive to testify falsely [1, 2]. Furthermore, the voluntariness and veracity of the confession were bolstered by the fact that the accused led authorities to the precise hiding place of the carbine, which was later scientifically proven to be the weapon used in the killing [3]. His defense of alibi failed against positive identification and the physical possibility of his presence at the scene, as his house was nearby [4].

The judgment of the lower court sentencing the accused to *reclusion perpetua* is **AFFIRMED**.
