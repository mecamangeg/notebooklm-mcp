I. CAPTION
PATERNO JAVIER v. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ANTIQUE, JOSEFINA B. ESPONILLA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24727, February 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections for mayor of Culasi, Antique, petitioner Paterno Javier and respondent Felix Lomugdang were candidates. The original returns for Precinct No. 4 credited Lomugdang with only 23 votes, although the tally board showed 83. All members of the Board of Inspectors initially signed a letter to the Board of Canvassers requesting correction of the return. However, the Board of Canvassers proceeded to proclaim Javier as the winner. After the Commission on Elections annulled the proclamation, Lomugdang and three election inspectors filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Antique for judicial correction of the returns under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code. During the proceedings, one inspector, Eliseo Amar, manifested that his name was included without his consent and objected to any correction without a recount of the ballots. Despite this, the CFI ordered the summary correction, ruling that Amar's belated refusal was merely obstructive given his previous admission of the error. Javier filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance may authorize the correction of election returns under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code when the members of the Board of Inspectors are not unanimous in their consent to the judicial correction.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Under Section 154 of the Revised Election Code, election inspectors may not make any amendment in their returns unless authorized by a competent court. The Supreme Court held that the court may not issue such authority unless the members of the corresponding board of inspectors are unanimous in acknowledging the error and are willing to rectify the same. The refusal of Inspector Amar to proceed with the petition resulted in a lack of unanimity, which barred the court from authorizing the correction. The Court reasoned that because a correction summarily disposes of a candidate's claim to office, it requires the maximum assurance obtainable short of a recount. Without unanimity, the proper remedy is a review of the ballots themselves, not a summary correction. The CFI exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the correction despite the lack of consent from all inspectors. The Court cited *Benitez vs. Paredes and Dizon*, *Board of Inspectors vs. Sison*, and *Astilla vs. Court of First Instance of Leyte* in support of this doctrine.

Petition granted. The decision of the Court of First Instance of Antique is annulled and set aside.
