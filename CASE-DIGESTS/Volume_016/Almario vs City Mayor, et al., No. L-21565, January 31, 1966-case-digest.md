I. CAPTION
ENRIQUE M. ALMARIO v. THE CITY MAYOR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21565, January 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 21, 1963, petitioner Enrique M. Almario filed a petition for mandamus before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against the City Mayor of Pasay and other officials [1]. Almario sought to compel the respondents to eject aliens from stalls in the Pasay public market, arguing that as a Filipino citizen, he had a duty to ensure the enforcement of Republic Act No. 37 regarding the nationalization of public markets [1]. The respondents filed a motion to dismiss, arguing Almario was not a real party in interest and failed to exhaust administrative remedies [2]. On April 18, 1963, the CFI dismissed the petition on the ground that Almario lacked the legal capacity and personality to file the suit [2]. Almario appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has the legal standing to file the petition for mandamus.
2. W/N the petition is premature due to non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that under Section 3, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, a petition for mandamus can only be initiated by a "person aggrieved" [3]. The petitioner is not an "aggrieved" person because he is not an applicant for any stall in the market, nor is he a representative of any applicant or stallholder deprived of their rights [4]. His interest is merely that of a "citizen at large," which does not entitle him to the writ (citing *Costa vs. Aldanese*) [4].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies [5]. Under Republic Act No. 37 and Departmental Order No. 32, any dissatisfied applicant must appeal the adjudication of stalls to the Secretary of Finance, whose decision is final [5]. The petitioner's failure to pursue this remedy rendered his petition premature [5].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [6].
