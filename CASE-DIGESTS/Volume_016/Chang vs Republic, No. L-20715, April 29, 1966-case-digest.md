I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, WAYNE CHANG alias WONG LIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20715, April 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Wayne Chang, a native-born Chinese who arrived in the Philippines in 1937, filed a petition for naturalization on March 16, 1961, in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Occidental [1, 2]. The petition listed his residences as Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental and 270 P. Casal, San Miguel, Manila [3]. However, evidence showed he had been employed and residing in Manila since 1958, and admitted in a motion to withdraw filed with the Supreme Court that he had been a resident of Manila since 1953 [2, 4]. He also failed to list his other former residences in Cebu City, Dumaguete City, and various other addresses in Manila [3]. Additionally, petitioner used multiple aliases (Wong Lian, Chang Wingkoy, Chang Wing) in official documents and schools prior to obtaining judicial authority to change his name in 1956 [5]. The CFI granted his petition, prompting the Republic to appeal [1, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental had jurisdiction to hear the petition.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence is fatal to the petition.
3. W/N the unauthorized use of aliases disqualifies the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The facts conclusively show that the petitioner had not resided in Misamis Occidental for at least one year immediately preceding the filing of the petition. Under Section 8 of the Naturalization Law, as amended, and the doctrine in *Chin Guan Go vs. Republic*, the Misamis Occidental court did not have the "exclusive original jurisdiction to hear the petition" [3].

2. **YES.** The verified petition failed to state petitioner's other places of residence, specifically Cebu City, Dumaguete City, and four other specific addresses in Manila. By established jurisprudence (*Republic vs. Reyes*), the failure to state all places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application for naturalization [3].

3. **YES.** The petitioner used various names (Wong Lian, Chang Wingkoy, Chang Wing) in dealing with the public, such as in his Landing Certificate and school records, without judicial authorization. The Court ruled that an applicant who adopts several names without judicial authorization is unworthy of Philippine citizenship, citing *Teen Eng Lee vs. Republic* [5].

**Judgment reversed; petition dismissed.** [7]
