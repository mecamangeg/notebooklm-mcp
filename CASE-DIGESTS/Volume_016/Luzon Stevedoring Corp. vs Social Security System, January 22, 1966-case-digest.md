I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-20088, January 22, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (Lusteveco) employed temporary workers, including stevedores, drydock workers, and relief crew members in Iloilo and Bacolod [1]. These employees worked on a rotation or intermittent basis, often for only a few days a year [1, 2]. In 1960, Lusteveco and various labor unions requested the Social Security Commission (SSC) to exempt these temporary employees from compulsory Social Security System (SSS) coverage, arguing that due to the intermittent nature of their work, they could not maintain membership long enough to qualify for benefits [3]. On April 16, 1962, the SSC denied the request and ordered Lusteveco to pay back premiums [3]. Lusteveco appealed, contending that compulsory coverage should apply primarily to permanent employees, as the law could not have intended to cover those who cannot accumulate enough contributions to enjoy the benefits [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N temporary and casual employees working intermittently are subject to compulsory coverage by the Social Security System.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the SSC resolutions [6]. The Court held that while the original Social Security Act (R.A. 1161) required six months of service for coverage, the amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 2658 eliminated this requirement [7, 8]. Consequently, coverage became compulsory for all employees regardless of tenure from the first day of employment [8].

While Section 8(j)(10) of the Act allows for the exemption of services performed by temporary employees, this exception is operative only if "excluded by regulation of the Social Security Commission" [9]. Since no such regulation was cited or issued by the Commission to exempt the specific class of employees in question, no exemption could be granted [9].

The Court further ruled that the intermittent nature of employment does not preclude entitlement to benefits. From the moment an employee is reported for membership, they are entitled to death and disability benefits pursuant to Section 13 of the Act; the number of contributions merely determines the amount of the benefit, not the right to it [10]. Regarding sickness and retirement benefits, the law does not require contributions to be consecutive or derived from the same employer [11]. Finally, the Court emphasized that social justice demands coverage for temporary employees who are more exposed to hazards and have "less in life" [6].

The resolutions of the Social Security Commission are affirmed [6].
