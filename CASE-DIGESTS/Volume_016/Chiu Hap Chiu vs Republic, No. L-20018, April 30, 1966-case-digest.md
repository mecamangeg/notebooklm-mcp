I. CAPTION
CHIU HAP CHIU, petitioner and appellee, vs. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, oppositor and appellant, G.R. No. L-20018, April 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Chiu Hap Chiu, a 30-year-old single Chinese physician residing in Davao, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to change his name to "Lo Hap Chiu" [3, 4]. He testified that "Lo Hap Chiu" was his birth name and the name he was known by from elementary school through college, and he sought the change to avoid confusion [3]. To support his claim, he presented his own testimony and a photostatic copy of a certification from the University of Santo Tomas showing his graduation as a Doctor of Medicine under the name "Lo Hap Chiu" [5]. The Republic opposed the petition [6]. The CFI of Davao granted the petition, finding that the petitioner desired the change because it was the name he used in school [4]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner presented a proper or compelling reason to justify a change of name. [6]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a change of name is a privilege and not a matter of right [2]. Before a person can be authorized to change their name, they must show proper or reasonable cause, such as when the name is ridiculous, tainted with dishonor, difficult to pronounce, or when the change is a consequence of a change in status or necessary to avoid confusion [6].

The Court found that the petitioner failed to satisfactorily prove his claim that he used "Lo Hap Chiu" throughout his schooling, as he presented no documentary evidence other than one university certification [5]. In contrast, he was registered with the Bureau of Immigration as "Chiu Hap Chiu," and used that name in official clearances [5]. The Court emphasized the State's interest in the names borne by individuals, especially aliens whose identity is established by their Alien Certificate of Registration [5]. Consequently, the Order appealed from is set aside [7].
