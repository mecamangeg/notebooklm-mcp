I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY vs. MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and ELEUTERIO CAPARAS, in his capacity as Commissioner of Customs at the Port of Manila, G.R. No. L-20144, January 31, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
From 1956 to 1959, Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC) imported bulk palm oil and tallow products which were discharged shipside from carrying vessels into lighters hired by PMC. Before the discharge, the Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, required PMC to pay "checking charges" amounting to P15,318.56, in addition to the regular duties and fees collected by the Bureau of Customs [1]. PMC paid the charges but subsequently filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for recovery of the sum, arguing that MPS had no right to collect such charges pursuant to the ruling in *Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Delgado Brothers* [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of PMC, ordering the defendants to refund the amount. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, attempting to distinguish the case from *Caltex* by arguing, among others, that the collection was based on the Tariff and Customs Code rather than just a management contract, that no protest was filed by PMC at the time of payment, and that MPS is a government instrumentality [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the arrastre operator (MPS) is authorized to collect checking charges from the importer for bulk cargo discharged shipside into lighters.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court, holding that the issue is substantially identical to that in *Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Delgado Brothers, Inc.* (96 Phil. 368), wherein it was ruled that arrastre operators have no right to collect checking charges for such shipments [5, 6]. The Court found the alleged distinctions immaterial, noting that Section 3102(f) of the Tariff and Customs Code (R.A. No. 1937) is merely a reproduction of the provision in the management contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs [7]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that no protest is necessary to recover payments that were exacted but not due [8]. Finally, regarding the nature of the appellant, the Court held that while MPS is a government instrumentality, it performs proprietary functions—not sovereign ones—and the principles applicable to private corporations regarding the collection of charges apply to it as well [7, 9]. The decision appealed from was affirmed [10].
