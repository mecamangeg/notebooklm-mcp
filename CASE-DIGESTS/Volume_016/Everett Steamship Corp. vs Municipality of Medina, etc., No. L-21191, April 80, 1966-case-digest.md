I. CAPTION
EVERETT STEAMSHIP CORPORATION v. MUNICIPALITY OF MEDINA, G.R. No. L-21191, April 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 9, 1958, the Municipal Council of Medina, Misamis Oriental enacted Ordinance No. 3, imposing a berthing fee on vessels mooring at the municipal wharf. Pursuant to this ordinance, the Municipality assessed Everett Steamship Corporation (Everett) the amount of P2,136.45 for two of its vessels that anchored alongside the wharf to discharge cargo. Everett paid under protest, arguing the ordinance was *ultra vires* and beyond the municipal council's power to enact. When its claim for a refund was denied, Everett filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The Municipality argued that under the principle of *ejusdem generis*, the statutory prohibition on "customs fees and dues" did not include berthing fees. The CFI ruled in favor of Everett, declaring the ordinance null and void and ordering the refund. The Municipality appealed. [1], [2], [3]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipality of Medina has the power to impose berthing fees on vessels. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that a municipal corporation has no inherent power to tax or license for revenue; such power must be expressly conferred or arise by necessary implication and is construed *strictissimi juris* against the municipality. [5], [6]

The Court found that Commonwealth Act No. 472 (Section 3) and the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264, Section 2) explicitly prohibit municipalities from imposing "customs duties, registration, wharfage... and all other kinds of customs fees, charges and dues." [7] Although "berthing fees" are not expressly mentioned, the Court applied the doctrine of *ejusdem generis*, ruling that such fees fall under the general classification of "all other kinds of customs fees, charges and dues." Since the ordinance defined the fee as a charge for mooring at a wharf, it partakes of the nature of a wharfage fee, which municipalities are statutorily barred from imposing. [8]

The appealed decision is affirmed. [9]
