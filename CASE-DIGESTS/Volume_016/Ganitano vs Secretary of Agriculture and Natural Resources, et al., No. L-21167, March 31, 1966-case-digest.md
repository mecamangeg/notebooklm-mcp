**I. CAPTION**
PRIMO GANITANO v. HON. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21167, March 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1955, Corazon B. Cabanos applied for a free patent over a parcel of land in Dingras, Ilocos Norte, which petitioner Primo Ganitano opposed [1]. The Bureau of Lands dismissed Ganitano's opposition and gave due course to the application [1]. On appeal, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources affirmed the Bureau’s decision, finding that Cabanos had a better right to the land by virtue of actual occupation and cultivation [1, 2].

Ganitano filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte to annul the Secretary's decision, alleging abuse of discretion [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition [3]. Ganitano appealed to the Supreme Court, not disputing the jurisdiction or the observance of due process by the administrative bodies, but asking the Court to re-evaluate the evidence submitted during the administrative proceedings [4, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the courts may review or re-evaluate findings of fact rendered by the Director of Lands and approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources regarding the disposition of public lands.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that under Section 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources is the executive officer charged with carrying out the provisions of the Act, while Section 4 gives the Director of Lands direct executive control over the disposition of public lands [6, 7]. Specifically, Section 4 provides that the Director's decision as to questions of fact is deemed conclusive when approved by the Secretary [6, 7].

For the courts to re-weigh evidence already passed upon by these officials would allow the judiciary to substitute its judgment for that of officials who are in a better position to consider such matters [6, 8]. Courts will not generally interfere with purely administrative matters unless there is a clear showing that the agency acted arbitrarily, with grave abuse of discretion, or in a capricious manner amounting to a lack of jurisdiction [6, 9]. Citing *Pajo v. Ago*, the Court reiterated that findings of fact by an administrative official following a hearing are binding upon the courts [9, 10]. Since the petitioner merely sought a new evaluation of the evidence without proving grave abuse of discretion, the petition was without merit [5].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [11].
