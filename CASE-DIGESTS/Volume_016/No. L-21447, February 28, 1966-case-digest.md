I. CAPTION
JOSE REYES, SOLEDAD REYES and CARMELITA REYES DE PASTOR v. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, Presiding Judge, Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch I) and EUSEBIO MILLAR, G.R. No. L-21447, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 3, 1949, spouses Feliciano and Pilar Basa leased three parcels of registered land in Manila to respondent Eusebio Millar [1]. Petitioners Jose Reyes et al. subsequently purchased the properties. Millar filed an action for specific performance in the lower court to compel the Basa spouses to sell the properties to him, claiming a right to purchase [2]. Initially, Millar deposited monthly rentals in court to avoid confusion as to who (between the Reyeses and the Basas) was entitled to them [3]. However, Millar later stopped depositing rentals, arguing that since he was demanding specific performance, he was occupying the premises "in the concept of owner" and that the sale in his favor should retroact to the filing of his suit [2, 3]. The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision requiring the deposit, to which Millar filed a Motion for Reconsideration, alleging errors in the statement of facts regarding a "supplemental lease" and reiterating his claim of ownership [1, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lessee (Millar) may stop depositing rentals in court while the suit to determine ownership of the leased property is pending.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that pending the outcome of the suit to determine ownership, the rentals must be deposited in court by the lessee to be disposed of in accordance with the final judgment [5].

The Court reasoned that until the property is actually sold to Millar, he remains a lessee, either by express agreement or implied new lease under Article 1670 of the New Civil Code [2]. Even assuming the sale eventually retroacts to the filing of the suit, that eventuality is uncertain [3]. To allow the lessee to stop paying rentals while continuing to possess and enjoy the property would result in injustice and is repugnant to Article 19 of the New Civil Code regarding human relations [5, 6]. The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [7]. Justice Barrera took no part [7].
