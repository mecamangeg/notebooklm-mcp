I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LIM TIAN TENG SONS & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21731, March 31, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Lim Tian Teng Sons & Co., Inc. (Lim Tian Teng), a copra exporter employing the accrual method of accounting, filed its 1952 income tax return reporting a loss. It declared P95,500.00 worth of copra shipped in 1951 as part of its "beginning inventory" for 1952. Upon audit, the Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) treated this amount as accrued income for 1951, resulting in a deficiency income tax of P10,074.00 plus a 50% surcharge for fraud. The CIR issued an assessment demanding payment by February 15, 1957 [1].

Lim Tian Teng requested a reinvestigation. The CIR did not reply but referred the case to the Solicitor General for collection. Lim Tian Teng reiterated its request, which the CIR conditionally granted provided the taxpayer waived the statute of limitations by December 31, 1957. Lim Tian Teng failed to file the waiver. Consequently, on September 2, 1958, the CIR filed a civil action for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [2, 3]. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic but set the interest start date to October 28, 1957, and failed to impose the 5% delinquency surcharge [3, 4]. Both parties appealed; Lim Tian Teng argued the court lacked jurisdiction as there was no "final decision" on the reinvestigation request [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a final decision by the Collector on a request for reinvestigation is a condition precedent to the filing of a judicial action for collection.
2. W/N the tax assessment had become final, executory, and demandable.
3. W/N the 5% surcharge for late payment is mandatory.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Collector of Internal Revenue is not required to rule first on a taxpayer's request for reinvestigation before filing a collection case. Under **Section 316 of the Tax Code**, the Collector may collect delinquent taxes by judicial action. The only requisite is that the assessment be made within the time fixed by law [5]. The legislative policy under **Section 305 of the Tax Code** (prohibiting injunctions against tax collection) favors speedy collection [6]. The referral to the Solicitor General and the subsequent filing of the complaint constitute the final decision denying the request for reinvestigation [7].

2. **YES.** Lim Tian Teng failed to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) within 30 days from receipt of the Solicitor General's demand letter (which served as the denial of the reinvestigation request). Consequently, the assessment became final, executory, and demandable [8]. In a suit for collection of a final assessment, the taxpayer is barred from disputing the correctness of the assessment or invoking defenses regarding the merits of the tax liability [8, 9]. Furthermore, the fraud surcharge was correctly imposed because the taxpayer deviated from its accrual accounting method to obliterate its tax liability [10].

3. **YES.** The 5% surcharge is mandatory and automatically due once the tax is not paid on time. **Section 51(c) of the Tax Code** uses the word "shall," which is imperative and leaves no discretion to the Collector [11, 12]. Additionally, delinquency interest should accrue from February 16, 1957 (the day after the due date in the assessment notice), not from the later date set by the lower court [13].

**Disposition:** Decision modified. Lim Tian Teng is ordered to pay the deficiency tax, the 50% fraud surcharge, the 5% delinquency surcharge, and 1% monthly interest computed from February 16, 1957 until fully paid [14].
