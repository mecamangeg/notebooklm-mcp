**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIZARDO PASIONA, G.R. No. L-18295, February 28, 1966, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 30, 1957, at around 7:00 P.M. in Salog, Goa, Camarines Sur, the victim Antonio Rios was at the store of Napoleon Picazo. Rios had an altercation with Simeon Arnesto and hit him. As Rios retreated towards the door, the accused Felizardo Pasiona suddenly hit Rios on the head with a piece of wood about one meter long and three inches in diameter [1, 2]. Rios fell and subsequently died of skull fractures and brain compression [2]. Prosecution witnesses Epitacio Gutierrez and Arnesto positively identified Pasiona, testifying that the store was brightly lit by a petromax lamp [3].

Pasiona raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was attending a novena at a house 150 meters away from 6:30 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. [4, 5]. He also imputed false motives to the witnesses, alleging Gutierrez testified falsely because Gutierrez's father suspected Pasiona of having an affair with his 67-year-old mother-in-law [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur convicted Pasiona of murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [8, 9].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused's defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by prosecution witnesses.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court held that the defense of alibi is generally weak because it is easy to concoct and must be viewed with caution, acceptable only when proved by positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence (citing *People v. Bautista*) [10-12]. Here, the accused admitted being only 150 meters away from the crime scene, making it physically possible for him to commit the crime and return to the novena unnoticed [5].

Furthermore, the prosecution witnesses positively identified the accused in a well-lit area [3]. The Court found the imputation of false motives to the witnesses—specifically that the 29-year-old accused was suspected of an affair with his 67-year-old mother-in-law—to be "quite unbelievable" and insufficient to discredit their testimony [7, 13]. The killing was qualified by treachery to murder, as the attack was sudden and occurred while the victim was retreating from another fight [14].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed in *toto* [15].
