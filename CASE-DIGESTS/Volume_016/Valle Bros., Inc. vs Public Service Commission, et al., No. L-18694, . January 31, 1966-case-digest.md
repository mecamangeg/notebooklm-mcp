I. CAPTION
VALLE BROS., INC., petitioner, vs. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, ET AL., respondents., G.R. No. L-18694, January 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Ismael Melendres applied for a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate 12 units on the Taguig-Divisoria line via Makati [1]. Petitioner Valle Bros., Inc. received notice of the application but failed to file an opposition on time and was subsequently declared in default [2]. During the hearings, oppositors TPT Trans. Co. and Halili Transit agreed to withdraw their objections if Melendres shortened the applied line to the Makati-Divisoria route [1]. Melendres accepted this compromise [3]. Consequently, the Public Service Commission (PSC) treated the case as uncontested and granted the CPC for the shortened line in a decision signed by only one Commissioner [4, 5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the amendment required written notice, the grant violated a ban on new lines in Manila, and the decision was void for lacking a full commission signature [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the shortening of the applied line required written notice to the petitioner.
2. W/N the grant violates the PSC Memorandum Order banning new services in Manila.
3. W/N the decision signed by only one Commissioner is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner had already been declared in default and had lost all standing in the suit [7]. Furthermore, the modification was not a formal amendment but a compromise that merely shortened the route; since the change was proposed by the oppositors themselves, serving notice to them would have been superfluous [8].

2. **NO.** The PSC Memorandum Order prohibited the issuance of certificates for "new" services, whereas the certificate in this case was issued to reinstate "abandoned" units [9]. Moreover, the Commission's primary consideration is public interest; it may revoke or override its own administrative rules if public welfare requires it, as the finding of public need prevails (*Cebu Ice and Cold Storage Corporation v. Velez*) [10].

3. **YES.** Upon the withdrawal of the oppositions, the case effectively became uncontested [5]. Section 3 of the Public Service Act explicitly provides that uncontested cases, except those pertaining to rate-fixing, shall be decided by one Commissioner [5, 11].

Petition dismissed; Decision affirmed.
