I. CAPTION
MARIANO H. ACUÑA v. HON. CESARIO GOLEZ and CARMEN D. CONSING, G.R. No. L-25399, January 27, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Acuña (Liberal Party) and respondent Consing (Nacionalista Party) were candidates for Representative of the First District of Capiz in the November 9, 1965 elections [1]. During the canvassing, Consing filed petitions for judicial recount (Election Cases No. 242, 245, and later 249) in the Court of First Instance presided by respondent Judge Golez [1, 2]. Consing anchored her petitions on alleged discrepancies and illegibility in the *Nacionalista Party's copy* of the election returns compared to the copies submitted to the Provincial Board of Canvassers [3, 4]. Acuña moved to dismiss, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction, but Judge Golez denied the motion [1]. Acuña filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, contending that a political party's copy of the returns is not a valid basis for a judicial recount under the law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code may be ordered based on a discrepancy between the Provincial Treasurer's copy and a political party's copy of the election returns.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the phrase "another copy or other authentic copy" in Section 163 of the Revised Election Code refers exclusively to the four (4) copies explicitly prescribed in Section 150 of the Code: one for the ballot box, one for the municipal treasurer, one for the provincial treasurer, and one for the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) [6]. The phrase does not include the additional copies distributed to major political parties pursuant to a COMELEC resolution, as the lawmakers did not prescribe such copies in the Code [6].

Furthermore, Section 163 must be construed restrictively because the special authority granted therein could be used to delay the proclamation of winners, potentially leaving offices without incumbents (*Parlade v. Quicho*; *Samson v. Estenzo*) [7]. While the distribution of copies to parties is valid to deter tampering, these copies cannot serve as a statutory basis for judicial recount [8]. The petition was **GRANTED**, and the respondents were perpetually enjoined from proceeding with the judicial recount [9].
