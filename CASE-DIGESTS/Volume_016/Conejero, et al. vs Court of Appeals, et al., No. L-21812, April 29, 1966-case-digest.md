I. CAPTION
PAZ TORRES DE CONEJERO and ENRIQUE CONEJERO v. COURT OF APPEALS, VISITACION A. DE RAFFIÑAN and ENRIQUE TORRES, G.R. No. L-21812, April 29, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Paz Torres de Conejero and her brother, respondent Enrique Torres, were co-owners of a property in Cebu City. On April 3, 1951, Enrique Torres executed a deed of absolute sale selling his undivided half-interest to respondents Visitacion and Miguel Raffiñan for P28,000. Petitioners were not informed of the sale until August 19, 1952, when Enrique Torres handed a copy of the deed of sale to petitioner Enrique Conejero.

Petitioners immediately offered to redeem the property but only tendered a check for P10,000, promising to pay the balance after obtaining a bank loan. The Raffiñans rejected the offer. On October 4, 1952, petitioners filed a complaint to compel redemption. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of petitioners, treating the contract as an equitable mortgage. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, holding that the transaction was a true sale and that petitioners failed to validly exercise their right of redemption because they did not tender the full price.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the furnishing of the deed of sale to the co-owner constitutes the written notice required by Article 1623 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N the petitioners validly exercised their right of legal redemption despite paying only a portion of the price.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Article 1623 does not prescribe a specific form of notice. The Court held that furnishing the co-owner with a copy of the deed of sale is equivalent to the written notice required by law, as it provides the details and finality of the sale in an authentic manner. Consequently, the 30-day redemption period began to run on August 19, 1952, when petitioners received the copy of the deed [1-3].

2. **NO.** A bona fide redemption necessarily implies a reasonable and valid tender of the *entire* repurchase price. The Court ruled that a buyer cannot be compelled to accept payment in installments, nor is a promise to pay the balance via a future loan sufficient. While consignation is not always necessary, a valid tender of the full amount within the 30-day period is indispensable to show good faith and ability to pay. Since petitioners only offered a P10,000 check against the P28,000 price within the statutory period, they failed to validly exercise their right to redeem [4-7].

**Petition DENIED. Decision AFFIRMED.**
