**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. PEDRO CO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19502, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Pedro Co, a married man, filed a petition for naturalization to become a Filipino citizen. The Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting his petition. The Republic of the Philippines appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The evidence established that for the three years preceding the hearing, Co's average annual income was only P2,320.00 (specifically P1,800, P2,160, and P3,000 for the respective years) [1-3]. Co has a wife to support [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Pedro Co has a lucrative income sufficient to qualify for naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Pedro Co does not possess a lucrative income. Relying on established jurisprudence such as *Yu Kian v. Republic* (where a married applicant earning P400.00 monthly was held to have no lucrative trade) and *Uy v. Republic*, the Court determined that an average annual income of P2,320.00 is not lucrative, particularly because the petitioner has a wife to support [1, 2]. Since the financial capacity requirement was not met, the Court found it unnecessary to pass upon the other objections raised by the Republic [4].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED**, and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [4].
