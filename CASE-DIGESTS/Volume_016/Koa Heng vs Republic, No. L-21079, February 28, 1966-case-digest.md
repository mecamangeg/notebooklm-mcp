I. CAPTION
KOA HENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21079, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Koa Heng, a citizen of the Republic of China, arrived in the Philippines in 1934 and resided in Angeles, Pampanga since 1943 [1, 2]. He filed a petition for naturalization on July 10, 1961, stating his residence in Angeles, Pampanga, but omitting his places of residence from 1934 to 1943 [3, 4]. He claimed this omission was an oversight in good faith [4]. At the time of filing, he had a wife and seven children, and an annual net income of P6,000 from his bakery and retail business [3]. He also admitted that at least one of his children was not registered with the Bureau of Immigration [5]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga granted his petition, finding him qualified [6]. The Republic appealed, arguing fatal omission of residence, lack of lucrative trade, and reproachable conduct [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the failure to register a child with the Bureau of Immigration constitutes reproachable conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure of the petitioner to specify in his petition all different places of residence in the country, as required by Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law, is a serious flaw resulting in the denial of the petition [4]. This requirement facilitates the checking of the petitioner's activities and character by the public and government agencies [4]. The defect is fatal even if done in good faith and cannot be cured by supplying the information during trial (*Lo v. Republic*; *Dy Pek Long v. Republic*) [4].

2. **NO.** Financial capacity is determined at the time of filing [7]. The petitioner’s net income of P6,000 per annum is not considered lucrative for an applicant with a wife and seven children to support, failing the requirement of Section 2, paragraph 4 of the Revised Naturalization Law [7]. The Court cited *Keng Giok v. Republic*, where P8,687.50 was deemed insufficient for a family of six [7].

3. **YES.** The failure to register a wife or child with the Immigration Office under the Alien Registration Act constitutes reproachable and improper conduct which precludes naturalization (*Co v. Republic*; *Chung Hong v. Republic*) [5].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and the petition for naturalization denied [8].
