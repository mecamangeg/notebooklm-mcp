**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FEDERICO SECAPURI, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-17518-19, February 28, 1966, Regala, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the stormy evening of June 27, 1959, in Miagao, Iloilo, Ceferino Eulogio and his 3-year-old son, Nestorio, were killed when shots were fired into their house. Another son was wounded. Ceferino was the overseer of Dr. Salustiano Mirasol's pasture land, which was the subject of a bitter dispute with local landowners, including appellant Federico Secapuri. Prior to the incident, Mirasol had filed a malicious mischief case against Federico and his son Conrado (appellants) for uprooting a fence, with Ceferino as the principal witness.

Despite the pitch-black night, prosecution witnesses Luz Pig-ao (the victim's wife), Alejandro Juderial, and Francisco Panes identified the appellants and co-accused Mariano Escubin (at large) lingering under a *sirguelas* tree near the scene for about an hour after the shooting. They claimed to have recognized the assailants through occasional flashes of lightning. The appellants voluntarily surrendered but raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were kilometers away at the time of the crime. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted them of murder and sentenced them to death.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the prosecution witnesses could have credibly identified the assailants given the dark and stormy weather.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should prosper.
3. W/N the appellants' voluntary surrender is an indication of innocence.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While the night was dark, the Court held that the claim of physical impossibility of identification could not be entertained because occasional flashes of lightning from the raging storm invariably illumined the place [1, 2]. The Court reiterated the rule that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great weight, as the trial judge is in the best position to observe the demeanor of witnesses (*People vs. Refuerzo*, 82 Phil. 576) [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prosper against positive identification by eyewitnesses (*U.S. vs. Oxiles*, 29 Phil. 587). Furthermore, the distance of 5 to 6 kilometers between the appellants' alleged location and the crime scene did not make it clearly impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime (*People vs. Palamos*, 49 Phil. 601) [5, 6].

3. **NO.** The voluntary and free submission to authorities is not irreconcilable with the fact of guilt. The Revised Penal Code assigns to it the value of a mitigating circumstance, not an exonerating one [1, 2, 5].

The Court affirmed the conviction for murder qualified by treachery but modified the penalty. Due to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the penalty was reduced from death to an indeterminate sentence of ten years and one day of *prision mayor* to seventeen years, four months, and one day of *reclusion temporal* [7, 8].
