I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GLICERIO SALVACION, G.R. No. L-20022, April 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 28, 1958, masked men entered the house of Pio Opema and Cirila Richa in Macalibre, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. They shot and killed Pio Opema and robbed Cirila of P300.00. Investigations led to Placido Hamoy, who was identified by a witness, Isabelo Ometer, as the person seen with appellant Glicerio Salvacion near the scene earlier that day [1]. Hamoy confessed that Salvacion hired him and others to kill Opema, who was Salvacion's father-in-law. Salvacion subsequently executed a confession [2]. However, during the trial, both Salvacion and Hamoy retracted their confessions, claiming they were secured through force, violence, and intimidation by the Constabulary [3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental rejected this defense, found Salvacion guilty of murder, and sentenced him to life imprisonment [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the accused were voluntary and admissible.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the lower court correctly rejected the claim of coercion. The voluntariness of the confessions was established by the following factors: (a) they were subscribed and sworn to before the Justice of the Peace; (b) the signatures were written with a firm hand; (c) the confessions contained a profusion of details; (d) the truth of many details was confirmed by the accused during cross-examination; and (e) the accused failed to complain of maltreatment to jail authorities for over a year after being transferred from Constabulary custody [5].

Furthermore, the short period of time the accused were in Constabulary custody minimized the possibility of effective duress [6]. The alibi presented was disproven by the positive identification by witness Ometer [7]. The Court affirmed the conviction for murder, noting the presence of evident premeditation and price or reward [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Sanchez concurred. Justice Zaldivar took no part [8].
