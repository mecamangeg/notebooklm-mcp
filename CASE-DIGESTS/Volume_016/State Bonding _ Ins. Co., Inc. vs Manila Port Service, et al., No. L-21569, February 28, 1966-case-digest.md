I. CAPTION
ESTATE OF THE DECEASED MR. AND MRS. FLORENCIO P. BUAN v. PRISCILLO CAMAGANACAN, G.R. No. L-21569, February 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 14, 1954, respondent Priscillo Camaganacan was a passenger on a Philippine Rabbit bus owned by the petitioners, the Estate of Buan [1]. While driving fast in Bulacan to overtake another bus, the Philippine Rabbit bus crashed into a trailer traveling in the opposite direction, causing injuries to the respondent [1, 2]. Camaganacan filed a suit for damages [2]. The trial court ruled in his favor, awarding P2,680.00 in actual damages and P2,000.00 in attorney's fees [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, solely questioning the award of attorney's fees, arguing that the trial court failed to state the reason for the award in the body of its decision [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper when the text of the decision fails to state the factual or legal justification for the grant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the text of the decision must state the reason why attorney's fees are being awarded; otherwise, the award is disallowed [5]. Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, the award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the rule, and public policy dictates against placing a penalty on the right to litigate [6]. Even under Article 2208(11), which allows fees when "just and equitable," the court must make an express finding of facts to justify the grant [6, 7]. Without such justification, the award is a "conclusion without a premise" and is improperly left to speculation [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that P2,000.00 in fees for P2,680.00 in damages was "hardly reasonable" [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED by deleting the award of attorney's fees [8].
