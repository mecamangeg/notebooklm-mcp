I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. WILFREDO G. CAINGLET, G.R. Nos. L-21493-94, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 13, 1962, Wilfredo G. Cainglet was charged with falsification of public documents in two informations filed before the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur [1]. The prosecution alleged that on April 22, 1959, Cainglet knowingly made false statements in his Judicial Form No. 106 (Answer) filed in Cadastral Case No. N-19, claiming ownership and possession of Lots Nos. 8492 and 8479, when in fact he did not own or possess them [2-4].

Before arraignment, Cainglet filed a motion to quash, arguing that the cadastral court had already rendered a final decision on October 30, 1959, declaring him the owner of the subject lots [5, 6]. He contended that this final judgment in a proceeding *in rem* was binding on the whole world and barred the criminal prosecution under the doctrine of *res judicata* [6, 7]. The lower court granted the motion and dismissed the cases. The People appealed [1, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a final judgment in a cadastral proceeding declaring the accused the owner of the land bars his subsequent criminal prosecution for falsification or perjury committed in said proceeding.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. While a final judgment in a cadastral proceeding is *in rem* and binding on the whole world to ensure the stability of Torrens titles, this conclusiveness is not absolute [7]. Public policy demands that perjury not be shielded by technicalities, as it strikes at the administration of laws [9].

Section 116 of the Land Registration Act (applicable to cadastral proceedings via Act 2259) penalizes whoever knowingly swears falsely, without distinguishing between those who succeed in deceiving the court and those who do not [10, 11]. To grant immunity to successful deceivers would put a premium on perjury [11]. Furthermore, a prosecution for falsification or perjury is a proceeding *in personam* regarding criminal liability; it is not a collateral attack on the title, and any judgment therein leaves the cadastral title undisturbed [12].

The order of dismissal is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [13].
