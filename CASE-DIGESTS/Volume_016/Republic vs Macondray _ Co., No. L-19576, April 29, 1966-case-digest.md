I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MACONDRAY & CO., G.R. No. L-19576, April 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 11, 1955, the Bureau of Immigration fined respondent Macondray & Co. P500.00 for violating Section 44 of the Philippine Immigration Act regarding an alien stowaway [1]. On April 11, 1960, two months before the five-year prescriptive period expired, the Solicitor General demanded payment [2]. Respondent requested that action be held in abeyance pending their appeal to the Secretary of Justice, which the Solicitor General impliedly granted [2, 3]. On September 6, 1961, the Republic filed a collection suit in the Municipal Court [1]. Respondent moved to dismiss based on prescription under Section 44(f) [4]. Both the Municipal Court and the Court of First Instance dismissed the case [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent is estopped from setting up the defense of prescription.
2. W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the case without receiving evidence regarding the suspension of the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The respondent is in **estoppel** and should not be permitted to rely upon the defense of the statute of limitations [3]. The Court found that the failure to file the action within the prescriptive period was due entirely to the respondent's express request to hold the matter in abeyance [3]. Citing *Collector of Internal Revenue vs. Suyoc Consolidated*, the Court applied the principle that a debtor who induces the creditor to delay collection is estopped from pleading prescription [3].

2. **YES.** Although the complaint did not explicitly allege the suspension of the prescriptive period, the petitioner raised the necessary facts in its answer to the respondent's motion to dismiss [5]. The lower court should have resolved the motion only after taking these allegations into account or receiving evidence in connection therewith [5].

The Order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
