**I. CAPTION**
*In the Matter of the Petition of Leoncio Dy alias Lee Han Too to be Admitted as a Citizen of the Philippines: Leoncio Dy v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. L-20152, February 28, 1966, Barrera, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Leoncio Dy, also known as Lee Han Too, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan [1]. In his petition, he stated that his present residence was in Dagupan City and his former residence was in Calasiao, Pangasinan [3]. However, documentary evidence—including his Alien Certificate of Registration (1950), Immigrant Certificate of Residence (1956), and Residence Certificate (1961)—indicated that he resided at various addresses in San Nicolas, Manila, which he failed to list in his published petition [3]. Additionally, the petitioner admitted to using the alias "Lee Han Too" without obtaining judicial authority [4]. The CFI granted the petition, finding that Dy possessed all qualifications. The Republic appealed the decision [2, 5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner's failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application. [5, 6]
2. W/N the use of an alias without judicial authority disqualifies the petitioner from naturalization. [5, 7]

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the requirement under Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Act to set forth present and former places of residence is mandatory [6, 8]. Non-compliance with this requirement is fatal to the application and affects the jurisdiction of the court taking cognizance of the case [6, 8].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner's act of using an alias without first obtaining judicial authority is a violation of the Anti-Alias Law (Commonwealth Act No. 142) [4, 7]. Consequently, the petitioner cannot be considered as having conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his period of residence in the Philippines, which is a requirement for naturalization [4, 7].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the application for naturalization is **DENIED** [1, 4].
