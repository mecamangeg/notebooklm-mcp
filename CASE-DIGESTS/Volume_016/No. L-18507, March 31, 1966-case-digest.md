I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMUALDO RODRIGO, G.R. No. L-18507, March 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Romualdo Rodrigo was charged with the crime of Theft of Large Cattle. The amended complaint alleged that on or about March 8, 1960, in Masbate, Rodrigo deliberately kept in his possession a horse belonging to Felix Muertigue, knowing that the horse was stolen from Muertigue's ranch, and failed to deliver it to the authorities or its owner [1]. The Justice of the Peace Court of Pio V. Corpuz dismissed the complaint, and the Court of First Instance of Masbate affirmed the dismissal [2]. The lower courts ruled that the complaint was defective because it failed to allege "intent to gain," which they considered an essential element [3]. The Solicitor General appealed the dismissal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint for theft of large cattle is defective for failing to explicitly allege "intent to gain."

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the complaint was sufficient as it satisfied the requirements of Rule 110, Sections 5 and 8 of the Revised Rules of Court [4]. The Court clarified that the accused was charged under Paragraph 2, Subparagraph (1) of Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code (failure to return lost property), in relation to Article 310 (Qualified Theft) [4, 5].

The elements of this specific mode of theft are: (1) the finding of lost property; and (2) the failure of the finder to deliver the same to the local authorities or to its owner [6, 7]. Unlike ordinary theft under the first paragraph of Article 308, where "intent to gain" must be proven as a separate element, in this specific type of theft, "intent of gain is inferred from the deliberate failure to deliver the lost property to the proper person, the finder knowing that the property does not belong to him" [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court held that the word "lost" is generic and includes loss by stealing [9]. Since the complaint stated the acts in ordinary language sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know the offense charged, the explicit allegation of intent to gain was unnecessary [3, 10].

The order appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
