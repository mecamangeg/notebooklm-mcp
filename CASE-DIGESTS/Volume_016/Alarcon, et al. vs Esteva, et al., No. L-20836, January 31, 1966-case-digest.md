I. CAPTION
ANA ALARCON, ET AL. v. JOSE ESTEVA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20836, January 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Roman Victor acquired a parcel of land in Rizal via Free Patent. Upon his death, his heirs, petitioners Ana Alarcon and Francisco Siena, sold the land on March 12, 1937, to respondents Spouses Jose Esteva and Elena Bautista [1]. The Spouses Esteva subsequently disposed of the property to other persons, who in turn resold it, resulting in the land being distributed under twenty-two (22) different certificates of title to various individuals [1].

On March 9, 1962, petitioners filed an action against the Spouses Esteva and their vendees for the redemption and reconveyance of the land under the Public Land Act [2]. The Spouses Esteva moved to dismiss the complaint against them, arguing that they had already disposed of the land and could not be compelled to reconvey it. The Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the motion and dismissed the complaint as to the Spouses Esteva [2]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the original buyers of redeemable property who have already disposed of it are proper parties defendant in an action for redemption.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the Spouses Esteva cannot be sued for redemption because they are no longer in possession of the land. The Court applied the principle *Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur* (no one is bound to do the impossible); since the respondents had already disposed of the property, they cannot be compelled to reconvey it, rendering the action against them moot and without a valid cause of action [3].

The Court explained that the obligation to reconvey upon redemption is an obligation *ad rem* that attaches to the land itself, regardless of who possesses it [4]. This nature is identical to the right of redemption in a *pacto de retro* sale, where the action may be brought against every possessor whose right is derived from the vendee [4]. Consequently, the proper defendant is the current possessor of the land, not the previous owner who has already transferred title [4, 5]. The trial court's order of dismissal was affirmed.
