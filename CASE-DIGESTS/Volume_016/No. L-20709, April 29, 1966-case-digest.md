I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR NATURALIZATION OF ANDRONICO AUGUSTO DY. ANDRONICO AUGUSTO DY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20709, April 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Andronico Augusto Dy, a Chinese national born in Bais, Negros Oriental, applied for naturalization. He claimed to be employed as a purchasing agent for Chin Agam Bakery with a monthly salary of P350.00 [1]. The petition was published in the "Negros Bombshell," and the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros subsequently granted the petition [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed, pointing out discrepancies in the petitioner's name. While the petition was filed under "Andronico Augusto Dy," his birth certificate, baptismal certificate, Alien Certificate of Registration, and other official documents listed his name as "Augusto Andronico Dy Kusen" or "Dy Kusin" [3, 4]. The Republic also questioned the newspaper's circulation and the credibility of the petitioner's income [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition is fatally defective for failing to disclose all of the petitioner's names.
2. W/N the publication in "Negros Bombshell" satisfied the legal requirement for general circulation.
3. W/N the petitioner satisfied the lucrative income requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES** (The petition is defective). The Court ruled that where an applicant is known by a name other than his real name, he must make a full disclosure of it by applying for naturalization under both names. Since the petitioner was commonly known as "Andronico Augusto Dy Kusin" based on his official documents, but applied only as "Andronico Augusto Dy," the publication was insufficient. Relying on *Yu Seco v. Republic*, the Court held that failure to publish all appellations defeats the purpose of publication, which is to apprise the public of the pendency of the petition so that those with derogatory information may come forward [2, 4].

2. **NO**. The Court found no positive proof that the "Negros Bombshell" was circulated in the entire province of Negros Oriental. A simple certification from the publisher regarding the generality of the newspaper’s circulation does not serve as positive proof thereof [2].

3. **NO**. Considering the high cost of living, the Court held that a monthly income of P350.00 is not lucrative [6]. Furthermore, the Court found the petitioner's claim of employment incredible, noting it was doubtful a small-town bakery would need a purchasing agent in a nearby town when materials could be purchased via correspondence [5].

The decision of the lower court is REVERSED [7].
