I. CAPTION
LAM YIN alias LIM YIN v. COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, G.R. No. L-22744, March 31, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lam Yin, a Chinese national, entered the Philippines in 1953 as a transient bound for Hong Kong but overstayed. The Commissioner of Immigration ordered her deportation on August 6, 1955. However, she was released on bond and remained in the country for eight years. In 1964, she was rearrested and detained after failing to leave the country by a specific deadline. She filed a petition for *habeas corpus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ordered her release on humanitarian grounds, ruling she had been detained too long (nine years since the deportation order). The Solicitor General appealed, arguing the detention was legal and that the delay was due to ongoing diplomatic negotiations between the Philippines and Nationalist China regarding overstaying Chinese nationals.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner’s continued detention pending deportation is legal despite the delay in the execution of the deportation order.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court’s judgment. The Court ruled that as long as the continued detention of a deportee is not attributable to the fault or negligence of the Government, and deportation is not rendered impossible by the alien's citizenship status (unlike stateless aliens), the warrant for deportation stands.

Citing *Tan Seng Pao v. Commissioner of Immigration*, the Court held that the delay was not the fault of the Philippine authorities but was due to diplomatic negotiations with Nationalist China. Unlike the stateless petitioners in *Borovsky* or *Mejoff*, Lam Yin is a citizen of a known country (Formosa/Nationalist China) that may eventually accept her. Furthermore, the Court noted she had already been accorded humanitarian considerations by being released on bond for eight years, which she utilized to prolong her illegal stay. To release her again would impermissibly sanction the indefinite stay of aliens under the pretext of being transients.

The petition for *habeas corpus* was **DENIED**.
