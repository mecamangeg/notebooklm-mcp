I. CAPTION
TEODORA MATIAS DE BUENCAMINO, ET AL. v. MARIA DIZON DE MATIAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19397, April 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Hilaria and Fulgencio Matias, concerned that their son Luis might dispose of their properties in favor of his illegitimate children to the prejudice of his legitimate children (Respondents), transferred three parcels of land to their granddaughter Teodora Matias de Buencamino (Petitioner). The family agreed Teodora would hold the properties in trust for her legitimate siblings. In 1938, an *Escritura de Venta con Arrendamiento* was executed transferring the land to Teodora and her husband, who then mortgaged it to pay off an existing debt. The grandparents remained in possession until their deaths, after which Luis’s widow, Maria, took over. In 1954, Teodora took possession and asserted ownership, prompting the siblings to file suit.

The Court of First Instance ruled the *Escritura* was merely an equitable mortgage. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the judgment but modified the legal basis, declaring the transaction an implied trust and ordering the land reconveyed to all siblings upon payment of the mortgage debt. Petitioners appealed, arguing the CA erred in deciding the case on the ground of trust—which was not assigned as an error—and that the action was barred by prescription.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals may affirm a decision on a legal ground different from that relied upon by the trial court.
2. W/N the action to enforce the implied trust is barred by prescription or laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** It is not incumbent on an appellee, who occupies a defensive position and seeks no affirmative relief, to make assignments of error. When a trial judge decides a case in favor of a party on a certain ground, the appellate court may affirm the judgment based on a different point or ground which the trial court may have ignored or decided erroneously. The CA correctly reviewed the whole case and established the existence of the trust based on the evidence [1].

2. **NO.** While an implied or constructive trust generally prescribes in 10 years, this rule does not apply where a fiduciary relation exists and the trustee continuously recognizes the trust. Such continuous recognition precludes the defense of laches. The evidence showed Teodora acknowledged the trust in a 1939 letter and in conversations with her mother [2]. She is deemed to have repudiated the trust only upon filing her answer to the complaint; thus, the action has not prescribed [3].

Petition Denied. Decision affirmed.
