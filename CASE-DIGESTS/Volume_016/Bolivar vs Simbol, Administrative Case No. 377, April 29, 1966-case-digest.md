I. CAPTION
CONCEPCION BOLIVAR v. ABELARDO SIMBOL Y MANUEL, Administrative Case No. 377, April 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Concepcion Bolivar, a woman with a sixth-grade education, and Respondent Abelardo Simbol, a law student, lived together as husband and wife from April 1953 to November 1957 [1]. Relying on Simbol's repeated promises of marriage, Bolivar supported his studies and personal needs, giving him approximately P8,000.00 [2]. Simbol used various excuses to delay the marriage, such as the lack of a solemnizing officer or the need to finish his studies [3]. Unknown to Bolivar, Simbol married another woman, Lydia Lingat, on January 5, 1957, yet he continued to live with Bolivar, concealed the marriage, and demanded money from her [2, 4]. Bolivar discovered the marriage in November 1957, but even in January 1958, Simbol attempted to resume their relationship and ask for money [5].

During the disbarment investigation, Bolivar executed a sworn withdrawal and desistance following an amicable settlement [6, 7]. However, the Solicitor General filed a complaint recommending suspension [8]. Simbol failed to answer the complaint and did not appear at the Supreme Court hearing despite notices sent to his counsel and his addresses in Manila and Dumaguete [9-11].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court can proceed with the case *ex parte* despite the Respondent's failure to answer or appear.
2. W/N the Complainant's withdrawal of charges warrants the dismissal of the disbarment case.
3. W/N the Respondent is guilty of grossly immoral conduct warranting disciplinary action.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Simbol waived his right to be heard. Under Section 30, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, if an attorney fails to appear and answer after reasonable notice, the Court may proceed to determine the matter *ex parte* [6, 12]. Simbol knew proceedings were pending, and his failure to inquire about his case or update his address implies a choice to waive his opportunity to defend himself [13, 14].

2. **NO.** The power to discipline lawyers, who are officers of the court, cannot be cut short by a compromise and withdrawal of charges [15]. Citing *Katalbas v. Tupas* and *In re Davies*, the Court ruled that action will be taken regardless of the complainant's interest if the facts warrant it, as the purpose is to protect the public and the court from unworthy practitioners [15]. The withdrawal was merely part of a plan to insulate the Respondent from disciplinary action [7].

3. **YES.** The Respondent is guilty of "grossly immoral conduct" under Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court [16]. The Court found that making a dupe of the Complainant, living on her bounty while dangling the mirage of marriage, marrying another secretly, and continuing to sponge on the Complainant constitute a character not worthy of a member of the Bar [17]. He failed to maintain the highest degree of morality required of the profession [16].

Respondent Abelardo Simbol y Manuel is suspended from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years [18].
