I. CAPTION
BASIC BOOKS (PHIL.), INC. v. EMILIO LOPEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20753, February 28, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Emilio Lopez, an agent of Basic Books (Phil.), Inc., received books on consignment worth P1,548.70 but failed to account for them, leading to the filing of a criminal case for estafa against him. On December 10, 1959, to secure payment of the obligation, Lopez and Isidro C. Kintanar entered into an agreement with Basic Books, binding themselves jointly and severally to pay the amount in installments with interest. The agreement stated that Lopez entered it to avoid criminal liability and that Basic Books would petition for the dismissal of the estafa case upon the posting of a surety bond.

When Basic Books filed a complaint to recover the sum, Lopez confessed judgment, but Kintanar denied liability. Kintanar argued the contract was void because its consideration was to stifle a criminal prosecution. The Municipal Court absolved Kintanar on the ground of illegal consideration. On appeal, the Court of First Instance reversed this, holding Kintanar liable as he knew of Lopez's indebtedness. Kintanar appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the agreement is void for having an unlawful cause (stifling a criminal prosecution).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the validity of the agreement and Kintanar's liability. The Court distinguished between the **cause** of the contract and the **motives** of the parties, citing Article 1351 of the New Civil Code which states that "particular motives of the parties in entering into a contract are different from the cause thereof."

The Court held that the **cause** of the agreement was the existing account/debt of Lopez with Basic Books. While Kintanar's **motive** in assuming the obligation may have been to help save Lopez from the criminal case, this motive is distinct from the cause. Kintanar's assumption of joint and several liability was moved by mere liberality or gratuitousness, not by the alleged illegal consideration of stifling prosecution. Furthermore, the Court noted that the criminal case had not actually been dropped, indicating the civil liability did not affect the criminal prosecution.

**Decision affirmed.**
