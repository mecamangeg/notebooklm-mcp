I. CAPTION
PASTOR GAMBOA v. DIONISIO PALLARCA and THE HONORABLE JOSE M. SANTOS, G.R. No. L-20407, March 31, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dionisio Pallarca was the share tenant of petitioner Pastor Gamboa on a riceland in Nueva Ecija since the 1957-1958 agricultural year [1]. On April 11, 1961, Pallarca notified Gamboa of his desire to change their tenancy relationship from share to leasehold tenancy effective the 1961-1962 agricultural year, invoking Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Law) [1, 2]. Gamboa refused, arguing that Pallarca had abandoned the land and that Section 14 of R.A. 1199 was unconstitutional for being an invalid exercise of police power and for violating the due process, equal protection, and non-impairment of contracts clauses of the Constitution [3, 4]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) ruled in favor of Pallarca, upholding the validity of the law and fixing the leasehold rental [5, 6]. Gamboa filed a petition for review by certiorari [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, authorizing the change from share to leasehold tenancy, is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended by Republic Act No. 2263 [4]. The Court held that the specific grounds raised by the petitioner—questioning the validity of the police power exercise and alleging violations of equal protection, due process, and the non-impairment clause—had already been resolved in previous decisions [4]. Citing *Ramos v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, *Macasaet v. Court of Industrial Relations*, and *Uichangco v. Gutierrez*, the Court reiterated that the provision is constitutional and found it unnecessary to elaborate further on settled jurisprudence [4, 8].

Petition denied; decision affirmed [9].
