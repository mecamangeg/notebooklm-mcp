I. CAPTION
GREGORIO FERINION v. DIOSDADO STA. ROMANA, RESURRECCION RAMOS, BASILIA FERINION and DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-25521, February 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Gregorio Ferinion filed a complaint on February 25, 1965, seeking the annulment of a power of attorney, real estate mortgages, and the resulting Torrens Title favoring the defendants [1]. This was the **fourth** time Ferinion had filed a case involving the same parties, subject matter, and causes of action [2].

The procedural history of the previous cases is as follows:
1.  **First Case (1955):** Dismissed without prejudice due to plaintiff's non-appearance [3].
2.  **Second Case (1956):** Dismissed "with prejudice" upon plaintiff's own motion [4], [5].
3.  **Third Case (1957):** Dismissed "without pronouncement as to costs" (effectively with prejudice based on the plaintiff's prayer) upon plaintiff's motion [6].

The trial court dismissed this fourth complaint on the ground of *res judicata* [1]. Ferinion appealed, and the defendants moved to dismiss the appeal as manifestly frivolous [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the action is barred by *res judicata* and manifestly frivolous.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that *res judicata* had set in [7]. The Court noted that three previous complaints regarding the same subject matter and parties had been dismissed, two of which were with prejudice, and those orders had become final [7].

The Court emphasized that while access to the courts is guaranteed, it has limits [8]. Once a litigant's rights have been adjudicated in a valid final judgment, they cannot be granted "unbridled license to come back for another try" [8]. Public policy demands that judgments become final at a definite date to put an end to controversies [9]. The Court ruled the appeal manifestly frivolous, citing *Cruz v. Blanco* [10].

Appeal dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**J.P. Bengzon and Zaldivar, JJ.,** concurred but voted to impose treble costs against the plaintiff-appellant [10].
