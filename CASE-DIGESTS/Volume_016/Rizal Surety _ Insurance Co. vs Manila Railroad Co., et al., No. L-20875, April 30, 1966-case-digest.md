I. CAPTION
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20875, April 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Rizal Surety & Insurance Company (Rizal Surety) insured a shipment of 464 cases of corned beef consigned to Filemon Lim & Co. Upon arrival in Manila, the Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company) discharged the cargo but delivered only 440 cases to the consignee. Rizal Surety paid the consignee for the 24 missing cases and, as subrogee, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The complaint named C.F. Sharp & Co., Inc. (the shipping agent) and the Manila Port Service/Manila Railroad Company as alternative defendants, claiming P690.18.

The CFI found the Manila Port Service liable for P488.87 (the value of 17 cases) but dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. The lower court ruled that the claim against the arrastre operator fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court since the amount was less than P5,000, notwithstanding the alternative admiralty claim against the shipping agent [1-3]. Rizal Surety appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a case joining an admiralty claim with a money claim that normally falls within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI has jurisdiction. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, a party may join alternative causes of action. The cause of action against the shipping agent (C.F. Sharp) was for breach of a contract of carriage by sea (admiralty), which falls under the jurisdiction of the CFI pursuant to Section 44(d) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [3].

Although the alternative cause of action against the arrastre operator (Manila Railroad) was for a sum of money involving an amount normally within the Municipal Court's jurisdiction, the rule states that if one of the causes joined falls within the jurisdiction of the CFI, the action shall be filed in the latter court [4, 5]. The Court cited *Sapico v. Manila Oceanic Lines*, affirming that the suit should be filed in the CFI notwithstanding that one cause of action, standing alone, would fall to the inferior court [5]. Furthermore, the subsequent dismissal of the case against C.F. Sharp did not divest the CFI of jurisdiction, as jurisdiction once acquired is not lost until the case is terminated [6].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is REVERSED, and appellees Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service are ordered to pay the appellant P488.87 plus interest [7].
