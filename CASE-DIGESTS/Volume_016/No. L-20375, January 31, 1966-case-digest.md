I. CAPTION
RAFAEL PE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20375, January 31, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On October 18, 1958, Rafael Pe filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. He alleged that his residence was at 989 Folgueras St., Tondo, Manila, and that he was employed with an average annual income of P1,800.00. The CFI granted the petition on December 26, 1959. In 1962, when Pe moved to take his oath of allegiance, the Solicitor General opposed the motion on the grounds that Pe lacked a lucrative income and failed to state all former places of residence. Evidence revealed that Pe's steady income (excluding unsteady bonuses and commissions) was only around P1,680 to P1,920 per year, or less than P200 monthly. Additionally, documents showed Pe previously resided at San Fernando St., 821 Folgueras, and 113 Elcano, none of which were listed in his petition. The CFI denied the opposition and allowed Pe to take his oath. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.
2. W/N the petition is fatally defective for failure to state former places of residence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The determining factor for lucrative income is the income at the time of filing the petition (*Ong Tai v. Republic*). Pe's steady income consisted only of his salary, as bonuses and commissions are considered unsteady and unreliable. Considering the high cost of living, a single applicant with a monthly income of only around P200.00 does not possess a lucrative trade or profession (*Albert Ong Lim Chuan v. Republic*).

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) explicitly requires a petition for citizenship to set forth not only the present but also all former places of residence. Pe's failure to state his residences at San Fernando St., 821 Folgueras, and 113 Elcano violates this provision and is a fatal defect that vitiates the petition (*Keng Giok v. Republic*).

The decision is reversed, the orders are set aside, and the oath of allegiance taken by the petitioner is declared null and void.
