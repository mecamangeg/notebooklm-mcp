I. CAPTION
LEOPOLDO DIAZ v. HON. SALVADOR C. REYES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25502, February 28, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
During the canvass of votes for Congressman of the First District of Nueva Ecija, the provincial board of canvassers discovered discrepancies in the election returns for Precincts 13 and 14 of the Municipality of Quezon [1]. In Precinct 13, the copy for the provincial treasurer showed candidate Leopoldo Diaz obtained 20 votes, while the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) copy showed "twenty-nine" in words and 20 in figures [1, 2]. In Precinct 14, the treasurer's copy showed 7 votes, while the COMELEC copy showed 17 [1]. Diaz filed a petition for judicial recount with the Court of First Instance [2]. Candidate Eugenio Baltao opposed, alleging that the words "nine" and "teen" in the COMELEC copies were intercalations and falsifications [2]. The respondent Judge initially ordered a recount but later set it aside to receive evidence on the alleged tampering [3]. Diaz moved for reconsideration, arguing that under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code, the court's function is merely to recount the ballots [3]. When the motion was denied, Diaz filed this petition for prohibition to restrain the lower court from receiving evidence on falsification [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court may receive evidence of falsification or tampering of election returns before proceeding with a judicial recount.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the reception of evidence regarding the alleged falsification is proper. Section 163 of the Revised Election Code allows a recount only when "authentic copies" of the election returns are contradictory [4, 5]. The law implies that if the copy containing the discrepancy is not authentic, or is tampered or falsified, there can be no basis for a recount, as the claim of discrepancy becomes a nullity [5]. Therefore, determining the authenticity of the documents through the presentation of evidence is "necessary and imperative" before the court can proceed with a recount [5]. The Court rejected the argument that the summary nature of the proceeding precludes such evidence, stating that the requirement for priority and early disposal applies to both the recount and the determination of falsification [6].

The petition is denied, and the restraining order is set aside [7].
