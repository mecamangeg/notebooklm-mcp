I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF BENEDICTO TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. BENEDICTO TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19647, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Benedicto Tan, a 21-year-old single male, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Quezon City granted the petition over the objection of the provincial fiscal [2]. The Solicitor General appealed the decision, arguing, among other errors, that Tan did not possess a lucrative occupation [3]. It was established that Tan’s total income, including meal allowance and overtime pay, amounted to approximately P2,500.00 per annum [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income to qualify for naturalization [3].

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found that the petitioner has no lucrative employment and is therefore disqualified from becoming a Filipino citizen [3]. The Court held that an annual income of P2,500.00 is not "lucrative" [4]. Citing *Uy v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-20208) and *Uy v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-20799), the Court noted that even incomes of P3,600.00 per annum or P250.00 per month have been deemed insufficient to satisfy the lucrative income requirement [5]. Consequently, the appealed decision is reversed and the application for naturalization is denied [5].
