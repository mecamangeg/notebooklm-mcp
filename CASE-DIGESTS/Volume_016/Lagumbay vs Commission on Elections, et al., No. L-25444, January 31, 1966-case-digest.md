I. CAPTION
WENCESLAO RANCAP LAGUMBAY v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and CESAR CLIMACO, G.R. No. L-25444, January 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 175, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In the 1965 national elections, Petitioner Wenceslao Lagumbay sought the revision of a COMELEC order regarding the canvassing of senatorial votes. In approximately 50 precincts in Mindanao (specifically Lanao del Sur), the election returns presented a unique statistical anomaly: the number of registered voters equaled the number of ballots cast, and every single vote was cast in favor of all eight candidates of the Liberal Party. Conversely, all eight candidates of the Nacionalista Party received exactly zero votes [1, 2].

The Supreme Court had previously issued a resolution on December 24, 1965, upholding the COMELEC's power to reject these returns as "obviously manufactured," noting that it was statistically improbable for the Nacionalista Party, which had inspectors in every precinct, to receive absolutely no votes [1, 3]. The respondents filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that such results were theoretically possible due to political control in the localities [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC has the power to reject election returns that are statistically improbable and obviously manufactured on their face.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the general rule is that fraud in the holding of elections should be settled by Electoral Tribunals where evidence is necessary, an exception exists where the fraud is "palpable from the return itself" (*res ipsa loquitur*) [5]. In such cases, the return is not entitled to *prima facie* value.

The Court found the returns "utterly improbable and clearly incredible" [6]. It is contrary to the ordinary course of things for 100% of electors to vote for all eight candidates of one party and give zero votes to the other, especially considering the Nacionalista Party had inspectors in those precincts who would presumably vote for their own party [7]. Relying on the doctrine in *Mitchell v. Stevens*, the Court classified these returns as "obviously manufactured" or fabricated [1, 8]. The Court refused to accept that voters could be converted into "sheep or robots" and concluded that the COMELEC has the power and duty to reject returns that are manifestly fabricated [4, 9].

The Motion for Reconsideration was **DENIED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Concurring (Barrera, J.):** Agreed that a line must be drawn against the tyranny of local boards of inspectors who manufacture returns, as they are more prone to political influence than the COMELEC [10].
*   **Dissenting (Bengzon, J.P., J.):** Argued that "statistical probabilities" is a shifting, uncertain line. Unlike returns showing an excess of votes over registered voters (which is impossible), 100% voting is merely improbable but possible. The COMELEC is a ministerial body and cannot go behind the returns; the remedy lies with the Senate Electoral Tribunal [11-13].
*   **Dissenting (Regala, J.):** Emphasized that the Senate Electoral Tribunal is the *sole* judge of *all* contests relating to election returns. The Court cannot amend the Constitution to exclude "obviously manufactured" returns from the Tribunal's jurisdiction [14].
