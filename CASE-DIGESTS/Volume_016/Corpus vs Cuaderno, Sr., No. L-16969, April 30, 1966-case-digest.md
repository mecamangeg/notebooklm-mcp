**I. CAPTION**
**R. MARINO CORPUS v. MIGUEL CUADERNO, SR.**, G.R. No. L-16969, April 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner R. Marino Corpus, Special Assistant to the Governor of the Central Bank, faced administrative complaints filed by bank employees in 1955 and 1958. Based on these complaints and the recommendation of Respondent Miguel Cuaderno, Sr., the Central Bank Governor, the Monetary Board suspended and eventually removed Corpus from office (though the removal was later declared illegal in a separate case due to insufficient cause). Corpus filed a suit for damages against Cuaderno, alleging malicious machinations and professional jealousy were the true causes of his suspension.

Cuaderno counterclaimed for damages based on libel. He cited a March 21, 1958 interview in *The Manila Chronicle* where Corpus claimed a "high-ranking CB official" instigated the charges. Corpus described this official as having been "dismissed for malversation from the Philippine National Bank (PNB) before the war" and discovered "milking a sugar central," but did not explicitly name Cuaderno. The trial court dismissed Corpus's complaint and ordered him to pay damages to Cuaderno for libel.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Cuaderno is liable for damages for the alleged malicious suspension and removal of Corpus.
2. W/N Corpus is liable for libel even though he did not name Cuaderno in the defamatory interview.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Cuaderno is not liable. The Supreme Court held that under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 265 (Central Bank Charter), the Monetary Board has the exclusive power to remove officers and employees. While the Board acts "on the recommendation of the Governor," the decisive action belongs to the Board, which has the power to adopt or reject such recommendation [1, 2]. The Court found no evidence that Cuaderno instigated the administrative complaints, which were filed by Corpus's own subordinates [3]. Cuaderno acted within his official duty and honest judgment based on loss of confidence [4].

2. **YES.** Corpus is liable for libel. The Court ruled that to maintain a libel suit, it is not necessary that the victim be named; it is essential only that the victim be identifiable [5, 6]. The requirement is met if "by intrinsic reference the allusion is apparent" or if the description allows others to know who was intended [6]. Here, the specific details—being a high-ranking CB official, former PNB official, and involvement with a sugar central—pointed unmistakably to Cuaderno [7]. Third parties, such as other bank officials, testified that they immediately identified Cuaderno from the description [8].

**Judgment affirmed.**
