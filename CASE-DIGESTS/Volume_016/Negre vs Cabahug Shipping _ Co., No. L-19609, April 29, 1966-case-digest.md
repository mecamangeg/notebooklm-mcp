I. CAPTION
JOSE NEGRE v. CABAHUG SHIPPING & CO., G.R. No. L-19609, April 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 24, 1961, petitioner Jose Negre entered into a contract of transportation with respondent Cabahug Shipping & Co. to transport 211 cases of dried fish worth P3,774.90 on the latter's motorboat "Jacoba" from Santa Fe to Cebu City [1-3]. While the boat was still docked at the wharf in Santa Fe, it flooded due to the gross negligence of the officers and crew, resulting in the total destruction of the cargo [3]. Negre filed a complaint for recovery of the value of the goods in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [1]. Although the respondent admitted liability for a slightly lower amount, it moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the amount claimed did not fall within the jurisdiction of the CFI [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction [4]. Negre appealed, arguing the action is one of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction cognizable by the CFI [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an action based on an oral contract for the transportation of goods by water involving a small amount. [2]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the action is one in admiralty and therefore comes within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, irrespective of the amount or value of the cargo involved [5-7]. The Court cited Section 44 of the Judiciary Act and established jurisprudence holding that admiralty jurisdiction extends to all maritime torts and contracts related to the trade and business of the sea [2, 8]. The Court found that the oral contract for the transportation of goods by water had been partially performed by the loading of the goods and was breached by the carrier's negligence, clearly making it a maritime transaction [7, 8].

The Order of dismissal is REVERSED and the case is remanded to the court of origin for proper proceedings [9].
