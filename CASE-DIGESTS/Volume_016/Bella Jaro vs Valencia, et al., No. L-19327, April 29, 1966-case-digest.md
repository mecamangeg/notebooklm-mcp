I. CAPTION
**AMADO BELLA JARO v. HON. ELPIDIO VALENCIA, Secretary of Health and HON. JESUS NOLASCO, Director of Health Services**, G.R. No. L-19327, April 29, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Amado Bella Jaro filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against respondents to nullify Special Order No. 2, which temporarily assigned him from his station in Cateel, Davao, to Padada, Davao [1]. The CFI rendered judgment declaring the order null and void and granting back salaries, but it did not award damages or attorney’s fees, finding that the respondents were not motivated by bad faith [2, 3].

The respondents appealed the portion of the decision nullifying the transfer (docketed as G.R. No. L-18352), while the petitioner appealed the portion denying him damages (the subject of this case, G.R. No. L-19327) [4, 5]. On August 30, 1963, in the respondents' appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and held the transfer valid because petitioner's appointment was not for a specific station but generally as a physician in the Municipal Maternity and Charity Clinics, Bureau of Hospitals [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents acted in bad faith in ordering the petitioner's transfer, thereby entitling him to damages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the respondents cannot be held to have acted in bad faith.

The Court relied on its prior ruling in G.R. No. L-18352, which established that the Secretary of Health has the authority to transfer or assign a municipal health officer to any station where their services may be utilized more effectively, provided the appointment was not for a specific station [4, 6]. Since the validity of the transfer order was already upheld, there was no sufficient showing that the respondents acted arbitrarily or were inspired by purely personal motives in issuing the order [5]. Consequently, there is no basis for the award of damages.

The portion of the decision of the lower court covered by the petitioner's appeal is **AFFIRMED** [5].
