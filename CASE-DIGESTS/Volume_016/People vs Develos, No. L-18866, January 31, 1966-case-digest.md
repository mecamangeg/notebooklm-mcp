I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIOSDADO DEVELOS, G.R. No. L-18866, January 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 17, 1961, Diosdado Develos (22 years old) and Santiago Aldea, Jr. (15 years old), who were employed as houseboys by Marcelino Tan Bon Huat, killed and robbed their employer in Iloilo City. While the victim was being massaged, Aldea struck him from behind. Develos then strangulated the victim with a rope, and Aldea set the body on fire to increase the suffering. The police arrested them, and Develos confessed.

Both were charged with robbery with homicide. Develos pleaded guilty. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted Develos and sentenced him to death, appreciating the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery, abuse of confidence, abuse of superior strength, and unusual cruelty. Co-accused Aldea was granted a suspended sentence due to his minority. Develos appealed, arguing he should also receive a suspended sentence and challenging the imposition of the death penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Develos is entitled to a suspended sentence under Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the suspension of sentence under Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code applies only to minors under sixteen years of age at the date of the commission of the felony. While his co-accused Aldea was only 15 years old, Develos was already 22 years old when the crime took place; hence, he cannot invoke the same treatment.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that evident premeditation was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. In his sworn statement, Develos claimed that when Aldea proposed the plan to kill their employer that evening, he replied "not yet," but Aldea struck the victim suddenly anyway. The fact that Develos did not assent to the killing at that very instant and lacked time for cool reflection renders the attendance of evident premeditation doubtful.

However, the Court affirmed the presence of abuse of confidence (as employees living with the victim), treachery (striking from behind without warning), abuse of superior strength (two attackers vs. one unarmed victim), and unusual cruelty (strangulation and burning). Despite these circumstances, for lack of the necessary votes for the imposition of the death penalty, the Court imposed the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Judgment modified.**
