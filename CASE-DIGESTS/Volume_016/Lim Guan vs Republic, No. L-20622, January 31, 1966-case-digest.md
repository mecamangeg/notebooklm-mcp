I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. LIM GUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20622, January 31, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Lim Guan, a Chinese citizen who arrived in the Philippines in 1935, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed to have married Anastacia Tan on April 4, 1944, but due to lost records, remarried her on April 15, 1957 [1]. He has nine children. The birth certificates of the children born between 1945 and 1955 indicated they were "not legitimate" or that the parents were "single," contradicting the alleged 1944 marriage [2, 3]. Additionally, Lim Guan purchased a residential lot in 1959 and failed to register his children with the Bureau of Immigration within the first 60 days of every calendar year, registering them years late [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Romblon granted his petition, prompting the Republic to appeal [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's relationship with his wife and the discrepancies in his children's birth certificates disqualify him for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner's failure to timely register his children violated the Alien Registration Act.
3. W/N the petitioner violated the Constitution by purchasing residential land.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner's illegitimate relationship with his wife prior to the 1957 marriage defeats his petition. The birth certificates presented by Lim Guan himself indicated the children were illegitimate, estopping him from denying these facts [6, 7]. Even if he were truly married in 1944, he would be guilty of falsity regarding the status of his children in public documents, which also disqualifies him (*Lao v. Republic*) [7].

2. **YES.** Section 10 of the Alien Registration Act requires parents of alien children to report to the Bureau of Immigration within the first 60 days of every calendar year [5]. Lim Guan only registered his children, some born as early as 1945, in 1957 or later [4]. This clear violation of the law renders his conduct far from being irreproachable (*Lu Beng Ga v. Republic*) [8].

3. **YES.** The petitioner's purchase of a residential lot in 1959 constituted a palpable violation of Section 5, Article XIII of the Philippine Constitution, which prohibits aliens from acquiring agricultural (including residential) land (*Krivenko v. Register of Deeds*) [4]. Such defiance of the fundamental law is inconsistent with the requirement of respect for the principles of the Constitution [4].

**Decision reversed; petition for naturalization denied.**
