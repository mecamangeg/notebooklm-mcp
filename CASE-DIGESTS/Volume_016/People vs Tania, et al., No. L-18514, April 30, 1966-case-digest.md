I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ORLANDO TANIA, RICARDO TANIA, TEOFILO DE LA CRUZ, and SERVILLANO MATA, G.R. No. L-18514, April 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On August 15, 1959, at about 2:00 A.M. in Barrio Balza, Buguey, Cagayan, the four accused forced their way into the home of spouses Gregorio Unida and Petronila Taloza. Orlando Tania and Servillano Mata, armed with guns, and Teofilo de la Cruz, holding a bolo, entered the house while Ricardo Tania guarded the door. They demanded money and took PHP 60.00 from a trunk. When Gregorio’s father, Melecio Unida, arrived at the scene to help, Orlando Tania shot him five times, causing his death. Before dying, Melecio identified Orlando as his assailant. The spouses immediately reported the identity of the accused to the Chief of Police but were instructed to keep it confidential to prevent the culprits' escape. The accused raised the defense of alibi. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan convicted them of robbery in band with homicide and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused's defense of alibi absolves them of liability for robbery in band with homicide.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court applied the established rule that appellate courts generally do not disturb the findings of the trial court regarding the credibility of witnesses, as the trial judge is in a better position to observe their deportment, unless facts of substance were overlooked [1], [2]. The lower court correctly disbelieved the alibi in view of the positive identification by the victims [3].

The crime committed was robbery with homicide, aggravated by the circumstances of dwelling, nighttime, and band. Under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty is *reclusion perpetua* to death. Since there were aggravating circumstances and no mitigating ones, the maximum penalty of death was technically applicable. However, for lack of sufficient votes for the imposition of the death penalty, the Court affirmed the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* [4], [5].

**Judgment affirmed.**
