I. CAPTION
CONSUELO G. DIAZ v. THELMA G. SAWAMOTO, in her capacity as Administratrix of the Intestate Estate of the deceased JOSE GAMIR, G.R. No. L-22085, April 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Segunda Vda. de Gamir died in 1955, leaving two legitimate children, petitioner Consuelo Gamir Diaz and Jose Gamir (represented by respondent administratrix). Her will was allowed probate in 1956 by the Court of First Instance of Davao. In 1958, the probate court approved the final accounts and project of partition filed by Jose Gamir, which included an interchange of lots between the heirs based on a mutual agreement [1, 2].

Subsequently, a dispute arose regarding a claimed permanent right of way. Petitioner Diaz sought to amend the project of partition to reflect this encumbrance. The lower court declared itself without jurisdiction to resolve the dispute or amend the partition regarding the encumbrance [3]. Diaz appealed the order.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court has jurisdiction to resolve the existence or non-existence of an encumbrance (right of way) on real property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that a probate court has no jurisdiction to make a pronouncement regarding the existence or non-existence of an encumbrance on real property, citing *Register of Deeds of Pampanga vs. Philippine National Bank* [3, 4].

Under Article 613 of the New Civil Code, a right of way is an encumbrance upon real estate. Since the existence of the aforesaid encumbrance was a controverted matter, the probate court lacked the jurisdiction to resolve and pass upon said dispute [3].

The order appealed from is affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, and Sanchez concurred [5].
