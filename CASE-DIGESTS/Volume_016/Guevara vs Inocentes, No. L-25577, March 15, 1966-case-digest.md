I. CAPTION
ONOFRE P. GUEVARA v. RAOUL M. INOCENTES, G.R. No. L-25577, March 15, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Guevara was issued an *ad interim* appointment as Undersecretary of Labor by former President Macapagal on November 18, 1965, and took his oath on November 25, 1965. Upon assuming office, President Marcos issued Memorandum Circular No. 8 on January 23, 1966, declaring that all *ad interim* appointments extended by the former Executive had lapsed with the adjournment of the special session of Congress at midnight on January 22, 1966. Respondent Inocentes was then issued an *ad interim* appointment to the same position.

Guevara filed a petition for *quo warranto*, arguing that his appointment remained valid because: (1) the Commission on Appointments (CA) was not organized during the special session; and (2) there was no "adjournment" of Congress as contemplated by the Constitution, since the House of Representatives merely suspended its session on January 22 to resume on January 24 (the start of the regular session), while only the Senate adjourned *sine die*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner’s *ad interim* appointment lapsed upon the adjournment of the special session of Congress on January 22, 1966.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner's appointment lapsed.

Under Article VII, Section 10(4) of the 1935 Constitution, an *ad interim* appointment is effective only: (a) until disapproval by the Commission on Appointments, or (b) until the next adjournment of the Congress. The Court held that these two modes of termination are completely separate and independent of each other [1].

The phrase "next adjournment of the Congress" refers to either a regular or special session. Applying the maxim *ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemus* (where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish), the Court rejected the petitioner's claim that it applies only to regular sessions [2].

Furthermore, the adjournment of the Senate *sine die* on January 22, 1966, constituted an adjournment of Congress. The House cannot legally hold a session independently of the Senate; thus, the House's "suspension" was ineffectual to continue the session [3]. A "constructive recess" is imperative between a special and a regular session; they cannot coexist or be continuous [4]. Consequently, the failure of Congress to organize the CA during the special session did not prevent the appointment from lapsing, as the "adjournment" mode of termination operates independently [5].

Petition denied.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Concepcion, J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that the House is not "Congress" and cannot hold session alone. Noted that the "next adjournment" limitation applies even if the CA has no time to act, as the purpose is to prevent indefinite interim terms [6, 7].
*   **Dizon, J. (Concurring):** Concurred with the majority and the reasoning regarding *ad interim* appointments found in the *Aytona* case [8].
*   **Makalintal, J. (Dissenting):** Maintained his previous dissent (grounds not detailed in text) [9].
