I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF JESUS NG YAO SIONG. JESUS NG YAO SIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20306, March 31, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jesus Ng Yao Siong, a Chinese resident of Dumaguete City, filed a petition to change his name to "Keng Lee Uy." His name recorded in the Civil Register was "Jesus Ng," but he had been using various other names (Jesus Uy Keng Lee, Uy Keng Lee, Keng Lee Uy, etc.) in his school records, income tax returns, and dealings with the public without judicial authority. The title of the petition and the order published in "The Negros Time" read: "In the matter of the change of name of Jesus Ng Yao Siong, Jesus Ng Yao Siong, petitioner," omitting his civil registry name ("Jesus Ng") and his other aliases. The Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction and the validity of the cause for the name change.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the case given the defects in the published title.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of unauthorized aliases constitutes proper and reasonable cause for a change of name.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A change of name is a proceeding *in rem* where jurisdiction is acquired by strict compliance with publication requirements. The Court ruled that for a publication to be valid, the title must include: (1) the applicant's real name (the name in the civil register), and (2) all aliases used. Here, the title failed to state the petitioner's real name, "Jesus Ng," and his other aliases. This failure to provide correct information in the heading is fatal and prevented the court from acquiring jurisdiction (*Tan v. Republic*).

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's use of various names without judicial authority violated Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law). To grant the change of name would be to sanction an unlawful act. Furthermore, the argument that the change would avoid "confusion" and "embarrassment" is not a proper and reasonable cause because the confusion was created by the petitioner's own unauthorized use of multiple names.

The appealed judgment is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED**.
