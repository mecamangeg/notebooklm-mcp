I. CAPTION
VICTOR EUSEBIO v. SOCIEDAD AGRICOLA DE BALARIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21519, March 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1923, Sociedad Agricola de Balarin (Sociedad), a partnership, filed Sales Application No. 6541 for certain public lands and introduced improvements. By 1940, all original partners had died, which technically dissolved the partnership under the old Civil Code. The partners' heirs resolved to continue the partnership under the same name and pursued the application. From 1943 to 1951, the heirs were forced to vacate the land due to war and Huk dissertation. During this period, petitioner Victor Eusebio and several intervenors filed lease and homestead applications over the same lots.

The Director of Lands initially rejected Sociedad’s application due to abandonment but later reversed this, ruling the abandonment was involuntary and reinstating the application in favor of the heirs. The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources affirmed this decision, rejecting Eusebio's claim and finding he entered the land in bad faith. Eusebio filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance, which was denied. He appealed directly to the Supreme Court, arguing that the heirs’ new partnership lacked the personality to succeed the dissolved Sociedad.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the heirs of the deceased partners can be subrogated to the rights of the dissolved partnership over the sales application.
2. W/N the Statute of Frauds applies to the alleged transfer of rights from a prior applicant to the Sociedad.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the death of the partners dissolved the original partnership, this did not automatically entail the forfeiture of rights acquired through the partnership’s application, improvements, and occupancy. **Section 105 of the Public Land Act** allows heirs-at-law of a natural person to be subrogated to the applicant's rights and obligations. The Court held that there is no cogent reason why this provision should not apply by analogy to the heirs of deceased partners, as a partnership is ultimately a collectivity of natural persons banded together for a common purpose, provided the heirs cleave to the original ends of the association [1]. Furthermore, the determination of whether successors should be subrogated lies exclusively within the discretion of land authorities [2].

2. **NO.** The objection regarding the lack of a written instrument for the transfer of rights is untenable. The **Statute of Frauds** does not apply when the case is neither for a violation of a contract nor for the performance thereof [3].

Decision affirmed.
