I. CAPTION
CATALINA VDA. DE ROLDAN v. MARIANO ROLDAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19601, March 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Catalina Vda. de Roldan filed a forcible entry complaint against defendants Mariano Roldan, et al. in the Justice of the Peace Court of Libmanan, Camarines Sur, which ruled in her favor [1]. Defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1]. The CFI Clerk of Court caused the Chief of Police to serve the notices of the appealed case upon the defendants personally, which they received in September 1959 [1].

The defendants failed to file an answer and were declared in default [2]. On December 12, 1959, the CFI rendered a judgment ordering them to vacate the land and pay damages [2]. After a writ of execution was issued and plaintiff was placed in possession, defendants re-entered the property, leading to a motion for contempt [3]. On December 3, 1960, defendants filed a "special appearance" questioning the jurisdiction of the CFI [4]. They argued that the notice of appeal was defective because it was served on them personally instead of their counsel, and served via the Chief of Police instead of by registered mail [4]. The CFI denied the motion, prompting this appeal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the service of the notice of appeal on the defendants personally, rather than their counsel, is valid.
2. W/N the service of notice through the Chief of Police, rather than registered mail, acts as substantial compliance with the Rules.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Section 7, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court (then in force) expressly provides that notice of the pendency of the appeal be given to the *parties* [5]. This provision is specific and cannot be interpreted to mean notice to the lawyer alone [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that in an appeal from an inferior court, the complaint is deemed reproduced, and the notification takes the place of a summons to bring the defendant under the court's jurisdiction [6, 7]. The Court relied on the doctrine in *Valenzuela vs. Balayo* to support this ruling [7].

2. **YES.** Although Section 7, Rule 40 requires notice to be sent by registered mail, the defendants admitted they actually received the notices through the policeman [8, 9]. The Court ruled that since there was no damage or injury caused to the defendants by this mode of service, it constituted substantial compliance with the Rules [8, 9].

Order affirmed [10].
