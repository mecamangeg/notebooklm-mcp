**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CAMOLO DIGORO alias PANONDIONGAN**, G.R. No. L-22032, March 4, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 20, 1961, an amended information was filed in the Court of First Instance of Lanao against Camolo Digoro for "Illegal Possession of Counterfeit Treasury and Bank Notes." The information alleged that Digoro willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, "with intent to possess," had in his custody various counterfeit bills in violation of Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code [1, 2]. Digoro pleaded guilty to the information and was sentenced to imprisonment of six years and one day to ten years and one day [3, 4]. Digoro appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing that the information to which he pleaded guilty did not charge an offense. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an information alleging possession of counterfeit notes "with intent to possess" charges an offense under Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code sufficient to support a conviction upon a plea of guilty.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the judgment and remanded the case for new prosecution [5].

Under Article 168 of the Revised Penal Code, possession of false treasury or bank notes alone is not a criminal offense; the possession must be **with intent to use** said notes [6]. The information against Digoro merely alleged "intent to possess," which is distinct from intent to use. In fact, "intent to possess" precludes a clear inference of intent to use, as the latter entails the intent to part with possession [4].

Furthermore, the allegations that the accused possessed the notes "unlawfully and feloniously" are mere conclusions of law, not allegations of fact [4, 7]. While a plea of guilty admits the material allegations of the information, it does not admit that the facts alleged constitute an offense [8, 9]. Since the information failed to allege the essential element of "intent to use," it charged no offense, and Digoro's plea of guilty did not warrant conviction [9].
