I. CAPTION
DOROTEA BALMEO v. CRISANTO ARAGON and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, G.R. No. L-21555, April 29, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On February 12, 1963, respondent Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed a suit in the Municipal Court of Manila against petitioner Dorotea Balmeo to revive a default judgment rendered on January 30, 1953. Balmeo moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the judgment had become final on the date of rendition and the 10-year prescriptive period for revival had lapsed [1]. PNB opposed the motion, claiming that Balmeo made several installment payments upon demand, which tolled the prescriptive period [1].

The Municipal Court denied the motion to dismiss [1]. Instead of proceeding to trial, Balmeo filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and/or injunction with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition *de plano*, declaring it unsubstantial [2]. Balmeo appealed this dismissal to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for certiorari or prohibition is the proper remedy against an order denying a motion to dismiss.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court [4]. The Court held that the Municipal Court is vested with discretionary power to grant or deny a motion to dismiss, and where such discretion is not gravely abused, the appellate court cannot exercise corrective power to annul the order [2].

Furthermore, an order denying a motion to dismiss is **interlocutory** and not appealable [2]. The Court ruled that the petitioner’s efficacious remedy is to proceed with the trial and, if defeated, to appeal the judgment [2, 5]. The Court cited *Nico v. Blanco* and *Philippine Refining Co., Inc. v. Ponce* to support the principle that entertaining such petitions sanctions unnecessary delay and encourages multiplicity of suits [2].

The appealed order of the Court of First Instance is affirmed [4].
