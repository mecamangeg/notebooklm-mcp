I. CAPTION
ELENITA V. UNSON v. COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. Nos. L-25084 and L-25270, February 28, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Elenita V. Unson appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) convicting her of estafa [1]. After receiving the decision, she filed a motion for reconsideration (MR) one day later. Upon the denial of this first MR, she sought leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, which was subsequently denied [2]. Unson received the order denying her leave to file the second MR on October 6 [2, 3]. On October 11, 1965, she filed a motion with the Supreme Court requesting an extension of time to file a petition for review [1].

Initially, the Supreme Court declared her petition out of time, reckoning the appeal period from September 24, the date she received the denial of her first MR [4]. Unson moved to reconsider, submitting a CA resolution clarifying that the 15-day appeal period should be counted from October 6 (receipt of the denial of the leave for the second MR), not September 24 [2]. The CA reasoned that requiring her to file a petition with the Supreme Court while her motion for leave was pending would have constituted an abandonment of her remedies in the CA [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period for perfecting an appeal is suspended during the pendency of a motion for leave to file a second motion for reconsideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the period for perfecting an appeal is suspended during the pendency of a second motion for reconsideration (or the motion for leave to file the same). The Petitioner filed her first MR only one day after receiving the decision, leaving her with 14 days of the reglementary period [3]. This remaining period commenced to run again only upon her receipt of the denial of the leave to file the second MR on October 6 [3]. Consequently, her 14-day period would expire on October 20 [3]. Since she obtained an extension from the Supreme Court on October 11 and filed her petition within said extension, the petition was filed on time [3]. The Court accepted the CA's reasoning that the Petitioner could not be expected to file a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court while her motion for leave was pending, as doing so would automatically withdraw her petition in the lower court [2, 3].

The resolution declaring the appeal out of time was set aside, the petition for certiorari was given due course, and the cases were consolidated [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
