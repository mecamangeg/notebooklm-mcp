I. CAPTION
PRIMO GAFFUD v. MARCIANA CRISTOBAL, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17638, February 28, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Primo Gaffud filed a complaint for possession and injunction against defendants-appellants (Cristobal, et al.) regarding parcels of land covered by Original Certificate of Title No. A-110 in his name [1]. Gaffud moved for summary judgment, attaching records showing that the appellants had previously filed nine separate complaints against him for reconveyance of the same lands, claiming possession since 1894 and alleging fraud by Gaffud's predecessor [2, 3]. These nine prior complaints were dismissed by the lower court on March 14, 1956, and the appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed on September 9, 1957, for failure to pay docket fees, rendering the judgment final [2, 4].

In the present case, appellants admitted that the lands they claimed were within Gaffud’s title and that their previous actions were dismissed, but they reiterated their claims of ownership and fraud [2]. The Court of First Instance of Isabela rendered summary judgment in favor of Gaffud, declaring him the absolute owner and ordering appellants to vacate based on *res judicata* [1]. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a purely legal question [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court correctly rendered summary judgment on the ground of *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. Under Rule 34, Section 3, summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law [5].

The Court held that there was no real issue as to any material fact because the appellants admitted the land was covered by the appellee's title and that their nine previous complaints for reconveyance regarding the same land were dismissed with finality [6, 7]. All elements of *res judicata* were present: (1) the judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction; (2) it had acquired finality; and (3) there was identity of parties, subject-matter, and cause of action between the nine prior actions and the present case [6, 7]. Since the appellee was declared the owner by final judgment, he is entitled to possession [8].

The judgment is affirmed [9].
