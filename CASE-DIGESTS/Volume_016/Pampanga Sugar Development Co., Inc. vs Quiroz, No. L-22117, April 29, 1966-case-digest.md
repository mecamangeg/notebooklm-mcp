I. CAPTION
PAMPANGA SUGAR DEVELOPMENT CO., INC. v. DONATO QUIROZ, G.R. No. L-22117, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Donato Quiroz, a centrifugal operator for petitioner company, finished his shift at 5:30 a.m. Shortly after stepping out of the company gate, he stood about 2 ½ meters away, between the highway shoulder and a railroad track intersecting the highway, to wait for a ride home. While waiting, he was bumped by a jeepney, sustaining wounds and a fractured clavicle [1].

The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in favor of Quiroz, ordering the company to pay compensation [2]. The WCC noted that the company had not taken measures to make the waiting place safe [1]. The company appealed, arguing the accident did not arise out of and in the course of employment [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the injury sustained by the employee outside the company premises while waiting for transportation is compensable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the WCC decision.

The general rule is that injuries sustained by an employee outside the premises of the employer, while going to or returning from work, are not compensable [4, 5]. For off-premises injuries to be covered under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, there must be a causative connection peculiar to the employment—a "very special danger" or particular risk which the employer could have caused or allowed to exist [6].

The Court held that no such special circumstances existed in this case. There was no particular causative connection between the injury and the work; the risk of waiting by the highway was common to the public and not peculiar to the employment [6]. Unlike in *Philippine Fiber Processing Co. v. Ampil*, where the employer was liable because the employee fell into a ditch near the gate which constituted an obvious hazard the employer failed to remove, the record here did not show that the accident occurred at a "usual" waiting place or that the place was particularly unsafe [7, 8].

The petition is granted, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the petitioner is absolved from the claim [9].
