I. CAPTION
LAGUNA TAYABAS BUS CO., petitioner, v. ANTONIO TIONGSON and FELICITAS J. TIONGSON, respondents, G.R. No. L-22143, April 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 3, 1958, petitioner's bus (LTB Bus No. 204) collided with a 7-Up delivery truck in Bay, Laguna. The bus fell on its side, resulting in injuries to passengers and the death of Ricardo C. Tiongson. The respondents, heirs of the deceased, filed an action for damages for breach of contract of carriage in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan. Petitioner argued that it exercised utmost diligence and that the accident was due to force majeure or the negligence of the 7-Up truck driver and highway authorities (due to a road depression).

The CFI ruled in favor of respondents, finding the LTB driver negligent for speeding and failing to brake in time despite knowing the road's condition. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the decision, noting that petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of negligence and that the driver had a record of traffic violations, indicating petitioner's negligence in employee selection and supervision. Petitioner appealed, questioning the findings of negligence and the award of moral damages and attorney's fees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is liable for breach of contract of carriage.
2. W/N the respondents are entitled to moral damages.
3. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The liability of a carrier is contractual and arises upon breach of its obligation to exercise extraordinary diligence (Arts. 1733, 1755, and 1756, New Civil Code). In case of death or injury to a passenger, the carrier is presumed negligent and bears the burden of proving it exercised the utmost diligence of a very cautious person. The Court found that the petitioner failed to discharge this burden, as the driver was speeding and, despite being familiar with the route and the depression in the road, failed to stop or brake in time to avoid the collision.

2. **YES.** While the general rule is that moral damages are not recoverable in actions for breach of contract, an exception exists when a passenger dies due to the carrier's negligence. Under Article 1764 in relation to Article 2206, No. 3 of the New Civil Code, the spouse, descendants, and ascendants of the deceased may demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the passenger (*Necesito v. Paras*).

3. **YES.** The award of attorney's fees is justified under Article 2208, Nos. 2 and 11 of the New Civil Code. The record established that the petitioner ignored the respondents' demand for an amicable settlement of their claim, compelling them to litigate.

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
