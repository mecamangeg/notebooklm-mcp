I. CAPTION
THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. EUGENIO B. RAMOS and PILAR MIRANDA, G.R. No. L-20978, February 28, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 29, 1961, Associated Reclamation & Development Corporation (ARDC) executed a promissory note for P11,765.00, secured by a surety bond issued by petitioner Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. On April 5, 1961, respondents Spouses Ramos executed a counter-guaranty with real estate mortgage in favor of the petitioner. On April 6, 1961, the respondents and ARDC executed an indemnity agreement binding themselves "jointly and severally" to indemnify the petitioner for any loss under the surety bond.

When ARDC failed to pay the note, the petitioner paid the obligation and subsequently filed a complaint against the respondents for reimbursement. The respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that under the counter-guaranty, they were mere guarantors entitled to the benefit of exhaustion of the principal debtor's properties. The Court of First Instance of Bataan dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents are entitled to the benefit of exhaustion of the principal debtor's properties.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that under the indemnity agreement, the respondents' obligation was joint and several. Under Article 1216 of the New Civil Code, a creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors or some or all of them simultaneously. The indemnity agreement, being executed one day after the counter-guaranty, could not have been modified by the latter.

Furthermore, even under the counter-guaranty agreement, the respondents are not entitled to demand exhaustion. Under Article 2058 of the New Civil Code, guarantors have no right to demand exhaustion of the properties of the principal debtor where a pledge or mortgage has been given as a special security.

The Order of dismissal is REVERSED and the case is remanded to the court *a quo* for further proceedings.
