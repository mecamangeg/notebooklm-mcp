I. CAPTION
PROCOPIO F. ELEAZAR v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-21693, April 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Eleazar was the Manager of the Industrial Department of the Development Bank of the Philippines (formerly Rehabilitation Finance Corporation). In 1954, he was suspended due to his involvement in a criminal case regarding a loan anomaly [1]. In 1962, the Board of Governors issued Resolution No. 4505, which reinstated him with a reprimand and authorized the payment of "all his salaries corresponding to the period of his suspension" [2]. However, the Auditor disallowed the payment of other emoluments, specifically bonuses, cost of living allowances, and gift certificates amounting to P13,055.41, because the resolution did not specifically authorize them [2]. The Board denied Petitioner’s request for these amounts, and the Auditor General affirmed the denial, stating these were privileges paid out of profits for services rendered [2, 3]. Petitioner appealed the Auditor General's decision [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner is entitled to the payment of bonuses, living allowances, and gift certificates covering the period of his suspension.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Petitioner is not entitled to the additional emoluments. The Board of Governors' Resolution No. 4505 merely provided for the payment of "salaries" and did not authorize other benefits such as bonuses and allowances [4]. The Court ruled that the grant of such emoluments is not a matter of right but a mere privilege which the Board may or may not allow depending on the circumstances [4]. Under Republic Act No. 85, as amended by Republic Act Nos. 208 and 3147, the Board is invested with the exclusive power to determine the propriety of such grants [4]. Therefore, the Auditor General correctly disallowed the claim. The appeal is dismissed [5].
