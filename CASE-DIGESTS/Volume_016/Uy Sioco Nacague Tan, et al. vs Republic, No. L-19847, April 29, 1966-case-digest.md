I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CORRECTION OF CERTAIN ENTRIES IN THE REGISTER OF BIRTHS OF OZAMIS CITY. GUADALUPE UY SIOCO NACAGUE TAN, as natural guardian of LORETA, TERESITA, CORAZON, ALMA, ROSALINDA AND VICTOR, all surnamed NACAGUE TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19847, April 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Guadalupe Uy Sioco Nacague Tan filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental to correct entries in the civil register of Ozamis City regarding the births of her children [1]. She alleged that while she is a Filipino citizen, she was erroneously recorded as "Guadalupe Ong" or "Guadalupe Uy" and as a Chinese citizen in her children's birth records [2-4]. She also sought to correct errors in the recording of her children's names [2]. The lower court initially granted the petition in a summary proceeding without hearing or publication [5]. After the City Fiscal moved for reconsideration, the court set aside the order but subsequently reversed itself again, ordering the correction of the mother's name to "Guadalupe Uy" [6]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the correction involved substantial matters, such as citizenship, which cannot be effected through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N substantial corrections regarding a person's name and citizenship in the civil registry can be allowed in a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the corrections sought cannot be allowed in a summary proceeding. Under Article 412 of the Civil Code, only clerical errors of a harmless or innocuous nature, such as clear misspellings, may be corrected [7]. Changes involving the civil status, nationality, or citizenship of parents are grave and important matters that affect the citizenship of the offspring [7]. Such substantial alterations must be threshed out in an appropriate action under Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court, which requires publication and notice to the whole world to bar indifferently all who might object [8, 9]. To allow such corrections in a summary proceeding would open the door to fraud [10]. Relying on *Ansaldo v. Republic* and *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that substantial changes require an adversary proceeding with due process [7, 11].

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DISMISSED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [12].
