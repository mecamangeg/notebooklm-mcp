I. CAPTION
SUN BROS. APPLIANCES, INC. v. ANGEL AL. CALUNTAD, G.R. No. L-21440, April 30, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Sun Bros. Appliances, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint in the Municipal Court of Manila against Angel Caluntad (Defendant) for the recovery of a G.E. television set or its unpaid balance. The parties had executed a conditional sale agreement for the TV at a price of P3,440.00, payable in monthly installments. Caluntad defaulted after paying only P1,442.00.

In his answer, Caluntad claimed the transaction was actually a usurious loan disguised as a sale. He argued that the true market value of the TV was only P1,500.00, but Sun Bros. increased the price by over 150% to P3,440.00. Sun Bros. did not deny this allegation of usury under oath. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that under Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, the failure to deny the allegation of usury under oath constituted an admission that the transaction was usurious and null and void. Sun Bros. appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the increase in price in a conditional sale on installment constitutes usury.
2. W/N the failure to specifically deny the allegation of usury under oath constitutes an admission that the transaction is a loan.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that an increase in price for a sale on credit or installment is not interest within the purview of the Usury Law. The owner of property has a perfect right to name the price at which he is willing to sell, fixing one price for cash and a different, higher price for credit. Such a transaction is a valid conditional sale, not a loan, unless the buying and selling was a mere pretense (*Manila Trading & Supply Co. v. Tamaraw Plantation Co.*).

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the failure to deny the allegation of usury under oath does not admit the nature of the transaction. The rule on implied admission applies only if the contract is a loan; if the complaint alleges a conditional sale, the defendant must first prove by competent evidence that the contract was really a loan in disguise. The law cannot presume the absurdity of collecting usurious interest on a contract of sale (*Lo Bun Chay v. Paulino*). Since the transaction was a conditional sale, the dismissal by the lower court was unjustified.

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justice Dizon concurs in the result.
