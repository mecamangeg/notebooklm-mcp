I. CAPTION
THEODORE GRANT, JR., represented by the mother FRANCISCA CASTRO, guardian *ad litem*, v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23609, March 31, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner was born on April 30, 1949, to Francisca Castro. Castro alleged the father was Theodore Grant, an American soldier she cohabited with, who later left for the United States. However, the petitioner’s birth certificate listed his name as "Patrick J. Bolan" and his father as "Patrick J. Bolan," an American soldier friend who brought Castro to the hospital. Despite this, the child was baptized as "Theodore Grant, Jr." and has used this name in school and with friends. He filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to change his name from Patrick J. Bolan to Theodore Grant, Jr. The Republic opposed the petition. The CFI granted the petition, and the Republic appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has proper and reasonable cause to change his name to the surname of his putative father without legal recognition.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that for a natural child to use the surname of his father, he must be acknowledged by both parents under Articles 282 and 366 of the New Civil Code. In this case, there was admittedly no evidence of recognition by the alleged father, Theodore Grant. The Court ruled that the petitioner cannot be allowed to use the surname of his putative father through a petition for change of name when he is not permitted to do so under the substantive law on surnames.

The Court cited *Manuel v. Republic* and *Lerma Garcia v. Republic*, stating that the petitioner's proper remedy is an action for recognition, not a change of name. Additionally, the Court noted that the use of "Jr." is restricted by Article 375 of the New Civil Code to a son who bears the same name as his father, making the name change inseparable from the issue of paternity. Finally, the Court reiterated the doctrine in *Ong Te v. Republic* that the mere habitual use of a different name does not constitute proper and reasonable cause to legally authorize a change of name. The petition was denied.
