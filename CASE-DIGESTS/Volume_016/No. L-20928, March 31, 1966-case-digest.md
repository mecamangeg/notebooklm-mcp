I. CAPTION
**NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS**, G.R. No. L-20928, March 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Governor-General issued Proclamation No. 5 (1913) and Proclamation No. 48 (1922), reserving 3,500 liters per second of water from the Angat River for the Metropolitan Water District (predecessor of Petitioner NAWASA) [1, 2]. NAWASA and its predecessor used this water without objection until 1959 [3]. A later issuance, Proclamation No. 72 (1950), reserved water for the Angat River Irrigation System [1]. The Respondent Secretary of Public Works and Communications issued an administrative decision adverse to NAWASA regarding the water rights [4].

NAWASA appealed the Secretary's decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI) by sending a complaint via registered mail on the 30th and last day of the reglementary period provided by the Irrigation Act [4]. The Respondent contended that the appeal was not filed on time because the docket fees were not paid simultaneously with the mailing [5]. The CFI reversed the Secretary's decision, upholding NAWASA's rights [6]. The Secretary appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing late filing and that NAWASA had not acquired the right to use the water by concession or prescription [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeal to the trial court was timely filed despite the docket fees not being paid simultaneously with the registered mailing.
2. W/N NAWASA acquired a valid right to the use of the Angat River waters.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that under the Rules of Court, the date of mailing by registered mail is considered the date of filing of any petition or pleading [7]. Regarding the docket fees, the Court applied Rule 141, Section 3 by analogy, stating that failure to pay fees in appealed cases does not automatically result in dismissal; rather, dismissal is discretionary [8]. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the appeal.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that NAWASA acquired the right through both administrative concession and prescription.
   
   First, the Governor-General’s Proclamations constituted a valid administrative concession [9]. Since the Governor-General exercised executive control over the Director of Public Works, applying for a permit to the Director would have been a "useless ceremony" as the Director could not refuse the Chief Executive's reservation [10]. NAWASA's grant is entitled to priority over the 1950 reservation for the Irrigation System because it was made twenty-eight years earlier [9].
   
   Second, the Court held that the Irrigation Law (Act No. 2152) did not invalidate prescription as a mode of acquiring title to public waters [11]. Both the Civil Code of 1889 (Art. 409) and the Law of Waters of 1866 (Art. 194) recognized prescription for 20 years, and the Civil Code of 1950 (Art. 504) reduced this to 10 years [11]. NAWASA and its predecessors had used the water for well over the required period [3]. The Court also noted that while prescription does not run against the State, NAWASA was not asserting adverse possession against the Government (who granted the right), but against the competing Angat River Irrigation System [12].

   **Decision affirmed.**
