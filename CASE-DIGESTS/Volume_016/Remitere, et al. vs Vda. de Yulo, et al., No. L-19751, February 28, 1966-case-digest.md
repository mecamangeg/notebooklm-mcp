I. CAPTION
ALFREDO REMITERE, ET AL. v. REMEDIOS MONTINOLA VDA. DE YULO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19751, February 28, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On December 6, 1961, petitioners Alfredo Remitere, et al. filed a complaint against respondent Remedios Montinola Vda. de Yulo and the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental, seeking the reconveyance of two lots originally registered to Gregorio Remitere [1, 2]. The complaint alleged that after Gregorio's death in 1914, the Provincial Sheriff conducted a public auction sale of the lots in 1918 to Mariano Yulo, from whom the respondent Remedios derived her title [3, 4]. The petitioners claimed that this 1918 sale was "absolutely a void sale" and did not pass title, but the complaint failed to state the specific facts or circumstances explaining why the sale was void [5, 6].

The respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no cause of action and that the action had prescribed [7]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental dismissed the complaint on these grounds [7]. The petitioners appealed, arguing the complaint sufficiently narrated facts constituting a cause of action [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint states a cause of action when it merely alleges a contract is "void" without narrating the ultimate facts constituting such invalidity.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action [9, 10].

A cause of action is an act or omission of one party in violation of the legal rights of the other [11]. Under the Rules of Court, a pleading must state the "ultimate facts" essential to the rights of action, distinguishing them from mere conclusions of fact or law [12]. The Court ruled that the allegation that the 1918 public sale was "void" is a mere conclusion of law [6]. Because the complaint did not allege the specific wrongful acts, omissions, or circumstances that rendered the sale void, it failed to assert the ultimate facts necessary to establish a right of action [6, 12]. Since the lack of cause of action was evident on the face of the complaint, the dismissal was proper [8].

The Order of dismissal was affirmed [10].
