I. CAPTION
THE CHIEF OF THE PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY, et al. v. THE JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, CALOOCAN CITY, et al., G.R. Nos. L-22308 and L-22343-4, March 31, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Ordinances were enacted in Caloocan City, Parañaque, and Pasay City authorizing the holding of cockfights on ordinary days (e.g., Wednesdays), in addition to the days allowed by the Revised Administrative Code (RAC). Pursuant to these ordinances, cockpit operators (Leon Roque, et al.) secured permits. When the Philippine Constabulary (PC) interfered with and stopped the operations on unauthorized days, the operators filed civil cases in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal. The respondent Judges (Valero and Bautista) issued writs of preliminary injunction restraining the PC from enforcing the RAC. The PC filed these petitions for certiorari to annul the injunctions. During the pendency of the proceedings, the cockpit operators moved to dismiss their cases in the lower courts, rendering the injunctions dissolved. However, the Supreme Court proceeded to decide the legal issue to address the theory that such ordinances are presumed valid until adjudged otherwise.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N municipal ordinances may validly authorize licensed cockpits to hold cockfights on days other than those prescribed in Sections 2285 and 2286 of the Revised Administrative Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Municipal councils cannot authorize cockfighting at any time other than those authorized in Sections 2285 and 2286 of the Revised Administrative Code (legal holidays and local fiestas for not more than 3 days).

The Court relied on the doctrine in *Quimsing v. Lachica*, holding that the authority of local governments under Republic Act No. 938 to regulate the "establishment, maintenance and operation of cockpits" does not include the power to regulate "cockfighting" (the frequency and days thereof), except that it must take place in a licensed cockpit. The power under RA 938 is limited to regulating the location, construction, and safety of cockpits.

Furthermore, RA 938 did not impliedly repeal the RAC provisions. Repeals by implication are not favored, and grants of power to local governments must be strictly construed against them. Consequently, the ordinances involved were declared null and void, and the respondent Judges gravely abused their discretion in issuing the injunctions.

The cases were dismissed, as the underlying lower court cases had already been dismissed by the respondents, but costs were taxed against the main respondents.
