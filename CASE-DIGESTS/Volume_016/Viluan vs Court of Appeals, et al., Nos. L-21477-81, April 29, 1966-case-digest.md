I. CAPTION
FRANCISCA VILUAN v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PATRICIO HUFANA and GREGORIO HUFANA, G.R. Nos. L-21477-81, April 29, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On February 16, 1958, a passenger bus owned by petitioner Francisca Viluan and driven by Hermenegildo Aquino crashed and caught fire in Bangar, La Union, killing seven passengers and injuring thirteen. The accident occurred while Aquino was racing an overtaking bus owned by respondent Patricio Hufana and driven by respondent Gregorio Hufana. The heirs of the victims sued Viluan and Aquino for breach of contract of carriage. Viluan filed a third-party complaint against the Hufanas.

The Court of First Instance found the drivers concurrenty negligent and held all parties (Viluan, Aquino, and the Hufanas) jointly and severally liable. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the finding of concurrent negligence but modified the judgment, holding Viluan solely liable. The CA absolved the Hufanas because the plaintiffs did not amend their complaints to assert a claim against them as third-party defendants, citing Section 5, Rule 12 of the old Rules of Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the third-party defendants can be held liable to the plaintiffs despite the latter's failure to amend the complaint to assert a claim against them.
2. W/N the common carrier and the third-party defendants (owner and driver of the other vehicle) are solidarily liable for the injuries.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The rule requiring a plaintiff to amend their complaint to assert a claim against a third-party defendant applies only when the third party is impleaded on an allegation of liability to the *defendant* (e.g., for indemnity or subrogation). It does not apply where the third-party defendant is impleaded on the ground of *direct liability* to the plaintiff, as was the case here where the third-party complaint alleged the accident was due to the Hufanas' negligence. In cases of alleged direct liability, the subject matter is already contained in the pleadings, and insisting on an amendment is merely a matter of form inconsistent with the liberal spirit of the Rules of Court [1], [2], [3].

2. **YES.** Where an injury to a passenger is caused by the concurrent negligence of the driver of the carrier and the driver of another vehicle, the drivers and owners of both vehicles are jointly and severally liable for damages. This solidary liability applies even if the carrier's liability arises from contract while the other party's liability arises from quasi-delict, as established in *Gutierrez v. Gutierrez* [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED**. Petitioner Viluan and respondents Patricio and Gregorio Hufana are declared jointly and severally liable for the damages awarded by the trial court [5].
