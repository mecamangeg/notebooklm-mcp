I. CAPTION
YU AN KIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21333, January 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu An Kiong filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1, 2]. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses: Jose B. Ramos and Pedro B. Reyes [3, 4]. Ramos, a former tutor, knew the petitioner since 1947 and visited the petitioner's house three times a week [3]. Reyes, a friend of the petitioner's father, met the petitioner in 1947 and they occasionally went to movies and restaurants together [4]. Both witnesses admitted they resided elsewhere and had no knowledge of the petitioner’s reputation in the specific vicinity where he lived [5, 6]. Additionally, while the petitioner listed his residences at 425 San Fernando and 908 San Nicolas, Manila, exhibits (such as income tax returns) revealed he had also resided at 827 San Fernando and 1045 Folgueras, Manila, which were not disclosed in his application [7]. The CFI granted the petition and allowed the petitioner to take his oath [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, questioning the competency of the witnesses and the failure to state all former residences [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses presented were competent and credible to vouch for the petitioner.
2. W/N the failure of the petitioner to state all his former places of residence in the application is fatal to his naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the character witnesses were not "credible witnesses" as contemplated by the Naturalization Law [10]. To be competent, witnesses must be able to testify on the petitioner's character and good moral conduct during the *entire period* of his residence in the Philippines [6, 10]. The witnesses in this case only knew the petitioner during periodic visits or social outings, which constitutes a "meager acquaintance" insufficient to vouch for his irreproachable conduct [6, 10]. Furthermore, they admitted lacking knowledge of his reputation in the community where he actually lived [6]. The Court cited *Chan Pong v. Republic* to support this requirement [10].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the failure to state all former places of residence is a fatal defect in an application for naturalization [7]. The exhibits showed the petitioner resided at 827 San Fernando and 1045 Folgueras, neither of which was mentioned in his petition [7]. This omission warrants the denial of the petition.

Accordingly, the decision and order appealed from are **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [11].
