I. CAPTION
CLARA SALAZAR, ESTER ORTIZANO, ET AL. v. FILEMON Q. ORTIZANO, G.R. No. L-20480, April 29, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Clara Salazar and Filemon Ortizano were married in 1926 and had five children. On November 1, 1960, Clara and her children filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Agusan against Filemon for support, custody of their two minor children, and separation of property based on a "Mutual Agreement" executed in 1957. The petitioners alleged that Filemon maltreated and abandoned Clara to live with a concubine in the conjugal home, and refused to provide support or surrender custody of the minors [1, 2]. The "Mutual Agreement" contained stipulations allowing both spouses to live with other partners without retaliation [3, 4]. Filemon moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing it was based on an illicit and immoral consideration. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the petition, ruling that the action rested entirely on the void "Mutual Agreement" [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition states a valid cause of action despite the illicit "Mutual Agreement" between the spouses.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the dismissal was erroneous because the petition alleged causes of action distinct from the "Mutual Agreement." While the agreement's illegality might affect the specific cause of action for separation of property based *solely* on that contract, it does not impair the other independent grounds alleged [6].

The Court found sufficient independent legal bases for the petitioners' claims:
1.  **Separation of Property:** The allegation of abandonment by the husband authorizes separation of property under the second paragraph of Article 191 in relation to Article 178, No. 3 of the Civil Code [7].
2.  **Support:** Article 291 of the Civil Code obliges a husband to support his wife. Furthermore, a wife is entitled to separate maintenance when the husband commits repeated acts of infidelity (*Dadivas de Villanueva v. Villanueva*) [7].
3.  **Custody:** The allegation that the minor children are living with the respondent's concubine supports awarding custody to the mother under Article 363 of the Civil Code, which treats the children's welfare as the paramount consideration (*Cortes v. Castillo*) [7].

Finally, regarding the lower court's intimation of a misjoinder of parties, the Court ruled that such a defect is not a ground for dismissal under Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court [8].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [8].
