I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LEON C. SO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEON C. SO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21762, April 29, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellee Leon C. So obtained a favorable decision for his naturalization application from the Court of First Instance of Pampanga in 1960. In 1962, he moved to take his oath. During the hearing, he testified that he worked as a sales clerk in a grocery store owned by his widowed mother, earning P300.00 a month, and claimed his mother owned land in Angeles, Pampanga. Noting that So was married with six children, the lower court doubted the sufficiency of his income and held the oath-taking in abeyance. Shortly thereafter, So presented a new contract dated October 25, 1962, increasing his salary to P900.00 a month effective November 1, 1962. Relying on this increase and considering him a co-owner of the land, the trial court authorized the oath-taking. The Republic appealed, arguing So lacked a lucrative trade or profession.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner failed to prove he possessed a lucrative trade or profession. The sudden increase in salary from P300.00 to P900.00 was deemed dubious and made for the sole purpose of satisfying the legal requirement of a lucrative trade [1]. The Court observed that the employer was the petitioner's own mother, and there was no logical explanation for the salary being suddenly trebled other than to adjust the evidence to the lower court's view [1]. The Court cited *Velasco v. Republic* and *Cu v. Republic* in rejecting such unexplained increases [1]. Furthermore, the claim of land co-ownership was contrary to petitioner's own testimony that the land belonged to his mother and she alone received the income [2]. Accordingly, the order appealed from was **REVERSED** and the petitioner's motion to take his oath was **DENIED** [3].
