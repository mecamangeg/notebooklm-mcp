I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GREGORIO RODRIGUEZ, G.R. No. L-18967, January 31, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Gregorio Rodriguez obtained two loans from the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. in 1943: one maturing on June 30, 1944, and another payable on demand. On January 21, 1946, these unpaid assets were vested in the United States Government via the Alien Property Custodian. Subsequently, on July 20, 1954, the loans were transferred to the Philippine Government under a Transfer Agreement. The Republic made demands for payment in 1954 and 1958, and eventually filed a complaint for recovery in June 1960. The Justice of the Peace Court and the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental both dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, reasoning that more than ten years had elapsed since the loans became due [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government's action to collect the loans has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The action has not prescribed. While the prescriptive period for this obligation is ten years, the running of this period was suspended by the Moratorium Law (Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32). The Court held that the Moratorium Law tolled the prescriptive period while the credits belonged to the Bank of Taiwan [5, 6]. Furthermore, after the United States acquired the credits in 1946, it was legally barred from suing due to the Moratorium Law until the law was struck down in *Rutter v. Esteban* in May 1953; this period of approximately seven years must also be deducted from the computation [7]. Consequently, less than ten years had elapsed when the Republic acquired the notes on July 20, 1954. Once the Republic became the owner, the statute of limitations stopped running entirely because prescription does not run against the State pursuant to Article 1108 of the New Civil Code [4, 6, 7].

The Order of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the record remanded for further proceedings [8].
