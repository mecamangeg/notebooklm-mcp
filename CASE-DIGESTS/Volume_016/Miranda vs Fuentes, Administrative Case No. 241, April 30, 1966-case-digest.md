I. CAPTION
MRS. REBECCA M. MIRANDA v. ATTY. FRANCISCO FUENTES, Administrative Case No. 241, April 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On November 4, 1953, spouses Jose Ramilo and Consuelo Borres presented a "Mutual Agreement" to respondent Atty. Fuentes for notarization [1, 2]. The document stipulated that the spouses renounced any claim for support and agreed not to live together [3]. Paragraph 4 stated they were "free to choose... their own ways of life, both having the freedom of living with anyone... nor the other having any claim or right to prosecute the first as a result of the exercise of such freedom" [3]. Complainant Miranda filed a disbarment suit against Fuentes for malpractice and unethical conduct for acknowledging an immoral contract [1].

Fuentes admitted acknowledging the document but denied drafting it [4]. He testified that he crossed out the words "marrying or" from the original draft and explained that the parties merely intended to formalize their separation without authorizing immoral acts [2, 5]. Evidence further revealed that Miranda filed the complaint out of revenge because Fuentes refused to pressure his sister to drop immorality charges previously filed against Miranda [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent is guilty of malpractice and unethical conduct for notarizing the "Mutual Agreement."

IV. RULING
**NO** (but Respondent was reprimanded). The Court held that the provision giving the parties "freedom of living with anyone" did not necessarily mean they authorized each other to commit immoral acts or live maritally with others [7]. While the clause waiving the right to prosecute could be interpreted as allowing acts punishable by law, the Court resolved the doubt in favor of the respondent, considering his explanation and the fact that the complaint was filed in bad faith for purposes of revenge [6, 7]. However, the Court **reprimanded and admonished** the respondent to be more careful in the future in the acknowledgment of documents similar in kind to the one involved in the case [6].
