I. CAPTION
AURORA C. MALLARI, et al. v. VICTORY LINER, INC., G.R. No. L-22043, February 28, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Jose Mallari, a driver for Victory Liner, Inc., died of "bangungot" on the evening of September 12-13, 1956, while sleeping inside the defendant's bus as required by his employment [1]. His widow, Aurora C. Mallari, and their minor children filed a claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Act (WCA). The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded them P4,000.00 plus attorney's fees [2]. Victory Liner appealed this award to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-20110), but the appeal was unsuccessful [2, 3].

Subsequently, the Mallaris filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales to enforce the WCC award pursuant to Section 51 of the WCA [4, 5]. The CFI rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering Victory Liner to pay the amounts due [4]. Victory Liner appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law, arguing that Section 51 of the WCA is unconstitutional because it effectively vests judicial powers in the WCC, thereby infringing on judicial prerogatives and independence [3, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 51 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act is unconstitutional for violating the principle of separation of powers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Section 51 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act is not violative of the principle of separation of powers [3, 6]. The Court reasoned that under the said provision, the award of the WCC was appealable to courts of justice [3]. If an award is favorable to the claimant and affirmed on appeal, or not appealed at all, it merely gives the claimant a cause of action for a judicial decision by a court of justice [3]. Crucially, it is the court's decision or judgment, not the administrative award itself, that is enforced by a writ of execution issued by the court [3, 7].

In this specific case, the WCC award had already been upheld by the Supreme Court in the previous case of *Victory Liner, Inc. vs. Aurora C. Mallari* (G.R. No. L-20110) [3]. Therefore, the appealed order of the CFI merely sought to enforce the decision effectively incorporated therein [3].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
