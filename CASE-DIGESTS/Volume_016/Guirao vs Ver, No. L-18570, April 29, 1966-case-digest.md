I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME GUIRAO v. EVARISTO VER, G.R. No. L-18570, April 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On April 11, 1957, petitioner Bartolome Guirao, a lawyer, filed a complaint against respondent Evaristo Ver to recover professional fees for services rendered between 1948 and 1950. Ver moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prescription, citing Article 1145 of the Civil Code which sets a six-year limit for actions on oral contracts. On May 11, 1957, the trial court issued an order dismissing the complaint. Unaware of this order, Guirao filed an Amended Complaint on May 18, 1957, clarifying that the fees were contingent on the successful termination of the case, which only occurred in October 1956. The trial court denied the motion to admit the amended complaint, ruling that it had lost jurisdiction over the case upon issuing the order of dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court retained jurisdiction to admit the amended complaint despite the prior issuance of an order of dismissal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction simply by issuing the order of dismissal. Under Rule 36, Sec. 2 in relation to Rule 41, Sec. 3, an order becomes final only upon the expiration of the 30-day period to appeal. Since the parties had not yet received the order and the period had not expired, the court retained the power to reconsider. Furthermore, Rule 10 allows a party to amend their pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served. Citing *Ong Peng v. Custodio*, the Court reiterated that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading. The amendment, which merely clarified the accrual of the cause of action, should have been admitted to serve the ends of justice.

The orders appealed from are set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
