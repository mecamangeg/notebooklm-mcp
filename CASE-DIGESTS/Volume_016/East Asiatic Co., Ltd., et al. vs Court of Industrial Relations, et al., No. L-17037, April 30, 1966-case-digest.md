I. CAPTION
THE EAST ASIATIC CO., LTD., E. JAKOBSEN, P. H. SORENSEN and K. R. NIELSEN v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, THE EAST ASIATIC CO. EMPLOYEES’ UNION (PTUC) and SOLEDAD A. DIZON, G.R. No. L-17037, April 30, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Soledad Dizon had been employed by petitioner East Asiatic Co., Ltd. for seven years, receiving yearly salary increases. In March 1958, the Asiatic Employees Union was organized, and Dizon became a member. On August 29, 1958, her immediate superior, petitioner P.H. Sorensen, scolded her for not finishing assigned tasks (letters of credit) on time, calling her inefficient compared to when she was not yet a union member. On August 30, following a heated exchange where Sorensen made sneering remarks about her "private business," Dizon left the office crying.

On September 4, 1958, petitioner Jakobsen, a manager, asked Dizon to resign voluntarily to avail of the Provident Fund, stating she had become inefficient due to union activities. When she refused, she was dismissed effective September 1, 1958. The Union and Dizon filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of Dizon, ordering her reinstatement with back wages. The CIR *en banc* denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration without allowing them to present oral arguments. Petitioners appealed, claiming a violation of due process and questioning the finding of ULP.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR's refusal to hear oral arguments on the motion for reconsideration violated due process.
2. W/N the CIR erred in finding the petitioners guilty of Unfair Labor Practice (illegal dismissal due to union activities).

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Hearing oral arguments on a motion for reconsideration rests upon the sound discretion of the Court. Its refusal does not violate the due process requirement in the absence of a showing of abuse of discretion (Sec. 6, Republic Act No. 875; *Manila Trading & Supply Co. v. Manila Trading Laborers' Association*). The CIR noted that the arguments in the parties' memoranda were exhaustive and sufficient to resolve the motion.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's finding of ULP. The factual findings of the CIR are conclusive if supported by some evidence in the record. The Court found that Dizon's delay was not habitual and she had been employed for seven years with satisfactory service. It was only after she joined the union that she was reproached for matters that might otherwise have been overlooked. The root cause of the dismissal was her concern for the new labor association, not the alleged inefficiency or discourtesy.

**Judgment affirmed.**
