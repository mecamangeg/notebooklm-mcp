I. CAPTION
NAMARCO EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS ASSOCIATION v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE EMILIANO TABIGNE OF THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and THE NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION, No. L-23294, April 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On July 8, 1964, petitioner Namarco Employees and Workers Association (NEWA) declared a strike against respondent National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO). On July 16, 1964, NAMARCO filed an unfair labor practice charge and an urgent *ex parte* petition for injunction with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to restrain NEWA from committing acts of coercion. Respondent Judge Tabigne issued a temporary restraining order on July 20. On July 30, NAMARCO filed a second petition alleging defiance of the first order. Judge Tabigne issued a second restraining order on August 3, 1964. Instead of filing a motion for reconsideration with the CIR *en banc*, NEWA filed a petition for certiorari directly with the Supreme Court on August 4, 1964, questioning the validity of the second order. On September 4, 1964, during the pendency of the case, the parties signed a return-to-work agreement ending the strike.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner can file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court against an order of a single CIR judge without first resorting to the CIR *en banc*.
2. W/N the case has become moot.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that only an award, order, or decision of the CIR *en banc*, and not that of any of its judges, is appealable to the Supreme Court (*Broce vs. CIR*). Failure to present a motion to reconsider before the CIR *en banc* is fatal to a petition for certiorari. The Court reasoned that while CIR rules require time for an answer to a motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* has the implied power to stay or suspend the enforcement of a trial judge's order pending the resolution of such motion to prevent it from becoming nugatory (Sec. 20, Com. Act No. 103).

2. **YES.** The dispute became moot and academic because the strike, from which the incidents arose, had been settled and the parties had entered into a return-to-work agreement on September 4, 1964.

The petition is dismissed.
