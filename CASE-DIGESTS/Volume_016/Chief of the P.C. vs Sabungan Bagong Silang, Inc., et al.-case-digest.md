I. CAPTION
THE CHIEF OF THE PHILIPPINE CONSTABULARY v. SABUNGAN BAGONG SILANG, INC., ARTEMIO PAGUIA and THE HON. GUILLERMO TORRES, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VIII (Pasig), G.R. No. L-22609, February 28, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Municipality of Mandaluyong, Rizal enacted Ordinance No. 1, Series of 1963, authorizing the holding of cockfighting (*pintakasi*) on days other than those authorized by law (such as Wednesdays) for charitable purposes, subject to the Mayor's discretion. Sabungan Bagong Silang, Inc. (Corporation), a licensed cockpit operator, obtained permits to hold cockfights on Wednesdays. The Chief of the Philippine Constabulary (Petitioner) threatened to prevent these events and prosecute the Corporation for violation of the law.

The Corporation filed a case in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 7544). On January 30, 1963, Respondent Judge Torres issued a restraining order preventing Petitioner from interfering. Petitioner moved to dismiss the case and lift the restraining order, arguing the ordinance was invalid. The hearing was postponed multiple times, and the Respondent Judge failed to resolve the motion to lift the restraining order or the main issue for an extended period. Petitioner filed this original action for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Municipal Ordinance authorizing cockfights on days other than those authorized by law is void.
2. W/N the Respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion by failing to resolve the issue for over three years.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Ordinance is void. It violates Sections 2285 and 2286 of the Revised Administrative Code, which restrict cockfighting to specific days. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Quimsing vs. Lachica*, holding that while Republic Act No. 938 authorizes municipalities to regulate the operation of cockpits, it does not allow them to authorize cockfights on days prohibited by the general law.

2. **YES.** The Respondent Judge’s inaction constitutes grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The Judge failed to resolve the issue of whether the restraining order should be set aside for over three years from its issuance on January 30, 1963, despite Petitioner's repeated pleas.

Motion granted; the writs of certiorari and prohibition are issued.
