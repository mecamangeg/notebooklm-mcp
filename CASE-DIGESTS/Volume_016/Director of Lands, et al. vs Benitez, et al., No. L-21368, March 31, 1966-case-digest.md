I. CAPTION
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ET AL. v. EMILIO BENITEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21368, March 31, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In cadastral proceedings in Leyte (1925-1928), respondents Emilio Benitez and Eulalia Brillo were declared owners of Lot No. 2157 via a decision rendered on December 29, 1932. Twenty-six years later, on June 19, 1958, respondents filed a petition to reopen the proceedings under Republic Act No. 931, claiming that an adjacent portion of 1,805 sq. m. was omitted from the original survey due to oversight. The Court of First Instance admitted the petition and eventually rendered a decision on April 14, 1962, declaring respondents the owners of an additional 3,745 sq. m. portion.

When respondents moved for execution in June 1962, the Solicitor General and about 62 occupants opposed. The occupants claimed they held permits and lease applications from the Bureau of Lands. The Solicitor General argued the 1962 decision was void for lack of publication and jurisdiction. The lower court denied the opposition and the motion to set aside the judgment. The Director of Lands and the adverse claimants filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court acquired jurisdiction to award the additional land to respondents by reopening the cadastral proceedings without new publication.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court's decision was a nullity. An order in a cadastral case amending the official plan to include land not previously included is void unless a new publication is made as a preliminary step. Publication is an essential basis for the court's jurisdiction in land registration and cadastral cases (*Philippine Manufacturing Company v. Imperial*; *Escueta v. Director of Lands*).

Furthermore, Republic Act No. 931 allows reopening only for lands that have not been "alienated, reserved, leased, granted, or authorized provisionally or permanently disposed of by the Government." Since the land in question was occupied by persons holding permits and paying rentals to the Bureau of Lands, the claim cannot be resolved in a reopened cadastral proceeding with limited jurisdiction but must be threshed out in a separate action with due notice to the adverse claimants and the Director of Lands.

The petition was granted, and the decision of April 14, 1962, was declared null and void.
