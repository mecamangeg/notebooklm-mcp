I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NORIL SAMPANG, JAMA-A CABANG and JALILOLA CAWANG, G.R. No. L-15843, March 31, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of November 13, 1957, in Basilan City, Helen Van Short, Percy Vicroy, Baby Short, and Jumadil Badul were ambushed at the gate of the Balas Plantation after returning from selling copra. Vicroy and Helen Van Short were killed, while Baby Short was wounded. The bandits took the copra proceeds and other valuables. Eyewitnesses Jumadil and Baby Short identified the accused Noril Sampang, Jama-a Cabang, and Jalilola Cawang as the perpetrators. The accused claimed alibi and questioned the witnesses' credibility due to initial failures to reveal their identities to the police. The Court of First Instance found the accused guilty of robbery with homicide and sentenced them to death.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused were positively identified as the perpetrators of the crime beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the accused were positively identified by the eyewitnesses. Specifically, Baby Short's revelation to the plantation helpers immediately after the ambush, identifying Noril and the other accused, constitutes part of the *res gestae* and affords strong evidence of participation [1, 2]. This positive identification overcomes the defense of alibi, especially given that the accused were located only seven kilometers from the crime scene [2]. The Court accepted the explanation that the witnesses' initial silence or inconsistencies were due to fear and shock, reiterating the doctrine in *People v. Gamlot* that trial judges' conclusions on witness credibility are usually not disturbed [3, 4]. The judgment of conviction was affirmed, but the penalty was modified to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of sufficient votes for the death penalty [4].
