**I. CAPTION**
CLETO ASPREC v. VICTORIANO ITCHON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21685, April 30, 1966, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Jacinto Hernandez filed an administrative complaint for unprofessional conduct against petitioner Cleto Asprec, a surveyor, before the Board of Examiners for Surveyors (the Board). Hernandez charged that Asprec failed to deliver an agreed plan for a lot survey despite payment and the lapse of four years. Asprec claimed he delivered a plan, but Hernandez alleged it was merely a copy of a survey made for another person, not the original survey agreed upon. The Board found Asprec guilty of deceit and revoked his certificate of registration [1, 2].

During the administrative proceedings, hearings were postponed several times. The hearing set for March 11, 1959, was rescheduled to May 11, 1959, upon the agreement of all parties because Asprec's counsel was ill. However, on May 11, neither Asprec nor his counsel appeared. The Board proceeded and rendered a decision revoking his license [3, 4]. Asprec filed a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, claiming he was denied his day in court and that the Board abused its discretion. The trial court dismissed the petition [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner was denied due process when the Board proceeded with the hearing in his absence.
2. W/N the Board of Examiners for Surveyors acted with grave abuse of discretion in revoking the petitioner's license instead of merely suspending him.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner was not denied due process. Due process in administrative proceedings generally requires that parties be given notice of the trial and an opportunity to be heard [4]. The presence of a party at trial is not the essence of due process; rather, it is the *opportunity* to be present. Since Asprec and his counsel agreed to the May 11 hearing date and had notice of it, their failure to appear without justification constituted a forfeiture of the right to be heard [4]. This rule applies even to quasi-criminal proceedings [6]. Furthermore, technical rules of procedure are not applied with rigidity in administrative bodies composed of technical men rather than trained judges [7].

2. **NO.** The Board acted within its authority. Petitioner argued that under the Surveyor's Administrative Order No. 1, a license could only be revoked after three suspensions. However, Section 10 of Act 3626, as amended by Act 3889, expressly grants the Board ample discretion to "suspend or revoke" the license for unprofessional conduct [8, 9]. The Court ruled that in a clash between a statute (the Act) and an administrative order issued in pursuance thereof, the statute prevails [9].

**Decision affirmed.**
