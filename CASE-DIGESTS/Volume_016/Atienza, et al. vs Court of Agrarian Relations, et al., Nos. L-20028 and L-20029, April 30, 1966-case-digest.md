**I. CAPTION**
GREGORIO ATIENZA, ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-20028 and L-20029, April 30, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Forty-four share-tenants (Petitioners) filed a claim against the Ascue spouses (Respondents) before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for the refund of amounts deducted from their shares for sugar cane hauling expenses [1, 2]. The spouses had charged half of these expenses to the tenants based on an agreement with Central Azucarera Don Pedro [2]. The CAR denied the tenants' claim, ruling that the spouses represented the tenants in dealings with the Central [3]. The tenants appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, arguing that a verbal agreement existed wherein the spouses agreed to shoulder all hauling expenses [3]. The appeal raised questions of fact regarding this agreement and involved a monetary claim of approximately 5,000 pesos [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the appeal involved questions of fact—specifically the existence of a verbal agreement regarding hauling expenses—and the monetary demand amounted to only about 5,000 pesos [3, 4]. Under Section 156 of the Land Reform Code (Republic Act No. 3844), such cases fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4]. Consequently, the case was referred to the Court of Appeals for decision [4].
