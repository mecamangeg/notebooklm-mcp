I. CAPTION
MANILA CORDAGE COMPANY v. FERNANDO VIBAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21663, March 31, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
A strike was declared by the Manila Cordage Workers Union against the petitioner on August 19, 1949 [1]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) declared the strike "highly unjustified and unreasonable" in an order dated September 16, 1949 [1]. As an act of grace, the CIR ordered the strikers to return to work within two days from receipt of the order; otherwise, the company was authorized to replace them [1]. The strikers received the order on September 17, 1949, making the deadline September 19, 1949 [2].

On October 27, 1958, respondents (strikers) filed a complaint alleging they attempted to return in accordance with the order but were refused admission [3]. In 1963, the CIR denied reinstatement but awarded backwages [4]. The petitioner appealed, arguing the CIR could not amend a final order and that the strikers failed to return within the deadline, evidenced by an injunction issued against them on September 28, 1949, and their own admissions that they offered to return only "sometime in October 1949" [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has the power to modify its decision after it has become final.
2. W/N the respondents are entitled to backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Industrial Relations retains the power to modify its decisions, orders, and awards, even after their finality, to accord substantial justice to the parties [7]. This power is derived from Sections 7 and 17 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 [8]. The Court held that where a matter comes into existence only *after* the rendition of a decision (such as inquiring whether the condition of returning to work was met), the CIR retains jurisdiction to amend its decision [9].

2. **NO.** The respondents are not entitled to backwages because they failed to comply with the return-to-work order [10]. Evidence showed that instead of returning by the September 19 deadline, the respondents continued their illegal strike, necessitating an injunction on September 28 and seeking clarification in November [5, 6]. Furthermore, their own bill of particulars admitted they tried to return only "sometime in October 1949" [6]. Since the return-to-work order was an act of grace, the respondents' failure to take advantage of it made them undeserving of further consideration, and the petitioner cannot be penalized for exercising its right to replace them [10, 11].

The decision awarding backwages is **REVERSED** [12].
