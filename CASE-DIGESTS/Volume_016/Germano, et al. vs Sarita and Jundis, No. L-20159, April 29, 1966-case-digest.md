I. CAPTION
MIGUEL GERMANO, ET AL. v. ERENEO SURITA and CANDIDA JUNDIS, G.R. No. L-20159, April 29, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On February 24, 1961, petitioners Miguel Germano, et al. filed a complaint to recover a parcel of land in Leyte from respondents Ereneo Surita and Candida Jundis [1]. Petitioners alleged that their deceased mother, Silvestra Zarco, delivered possession of the land to Teodoro Jundis in 1939 to secure a P60.00 indebtedness [1]. They claimed to have tendered payment to Jundis’ heirs after World War II and deposited the amount in court in 1959, but respondents refused to return the property [1, 2]. Respondents moved to dismiss, arguing the 1939 transaction was a sale, not a mortgage, and that the action was barred by prescription and laches as they had been in possession since 1939 [2]. The trial court, without receiving evidence, dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription, ruling that the lapse of time barred the action under the Civil Code [3, 4]. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, contending that respondents' possession as mortgagees was not in the concept of an owner, but the motion was denied [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on the ground of prescription without a trial on the merits.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order of dismissal was improper [6]. The pleadings posed a specific question of fact: whether the transaction between the parties' predecessors was an equitable mortgage or a sale [7]. The determination of the respective rights of the parties, including the applicability of prescription, depends entirely on resolving this factual issue [7]. If the transaction was a mortgage, the nature of the respondents' possession would differ from that of a sale. Therefore, the trial court should have granted the motion to reset the case for hearing to enable the parties to present evidence [7]. The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [8].
