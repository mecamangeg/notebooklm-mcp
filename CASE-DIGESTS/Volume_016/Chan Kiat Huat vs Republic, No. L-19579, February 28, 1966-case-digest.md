I. CAPTION
CHAN KIAT HUAT v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19579, February 28, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Chan Kiat Huat, a Chinese national born in 1919, arrived in the Philippines in 1925. He resided in Manila until 1953, after which he moved to Bacolod City. He married Felipa Te and they have nine children. Chan operates a wholesale general merchandise business called "Golden Light Trading" with a reported net income of P6,571.86 for the year 1960. Eight of his children were enrolled at Tay Tung High School in Bacolod City, a school predominantly attended by Chinese students.

On January 31, 1961, Chan filed a petition for naturalization. In his petition, he listed Bacolod City as his residence but failed to state that he had previously resided in Manila and Umingan, Pangasinan. The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros granted the petition. The Republic appealed, challenging Chan's financial capacity, the sincerity of his intention to embrace Filipino culture due to his children's schooling, and the jurisdictional defect regarding his undisclosed residences.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the enrollment of petitioner's children in a Chinese school is a ground for disqualification.
3. W/N the failure to state former places of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's annual income of P6,571.86 does not rise to the level of a lucrative business [1]. Considering the high cost of living, the low buying power of money, and the fact that the petitioner must support himself, his wife, and nine children, this income is insufficient [1]. The Court relied on the standard set in *Keng Giok vs. Republic* [1].

2. **YES.** The enrollment of the applicant's children in a Chinese school (Tay Tung High School) raises the inference that he has not evinced a sincere desire to embrace Philippine customs, traditions, and ideals [2]. This constitutes a disqualification in a citizenship application as held in *Lim Yuen vs. Republic* [2].

3. **YES.** Section 7 of the Naturalization Act makes it mandatory for a petitioner to set forth "his present and former places of residence" [3]. Chan's failure to state his former residences in Manila and Pangasinan is a fatal defect that affects the jurisdiction of the court (*Yao Long vs. Republic*) [3]. This omission deprives the public and the government of a fair opportunity to check the petitioner's past activities and register objections to his application (*Cheng vs. Republic*) [3].

Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the petition for naturalization is denied [4].
