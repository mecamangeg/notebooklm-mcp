I. CAPTION
CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. CONSTANTINO DERPO and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-19698, January 31, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Constantino Derpo worked as a casual laborer for Caltex since October 1953, performing tasks such as drum filling, soldering, and painting, which exposed him to waste, oil, and fumes from burnt acid, paint, and thinner [1, 2]. On February 16, 1959, he was separated from service after a medical examination revealed he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. Derpo filed a claim for compensation under Act 3428. The hearing officer dismissed the claim, but the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision, awarding disability compensation and attorney's fees [3, 4]. The WCC found that since Derpo was healthy upon employment, his work conditions contributed to his illness [2, 5]. Caltex petitioned for review, arguing the illness was not work-related and questioning the award of attorney’s fees [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Derpo's tuberculosis is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the award of attorney’s fees against the employer is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the WCC's finding that the illness was compensable. Derpo’s pre-employment examination showed he was healthy and fit for work [5]. The fact that he later contracted tuberculosis, absent other circumstances, indicates that the nature and conditions of his employment—specifically the daily exposure to fumes and chemicals—caused or at least contributed to his illness [2, 5]. Thus, he is entitled to benefits under Act 3428, as amended [7].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that under Article 2208, paragraph 8 of the New Civil Code (Act No. 386), in relation to Article 2253, a claimant is entitled to attorney’s fees chargeable against the employer in actions for indemnity under the Workmen’s Compensation Law [6].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is affirmed [6].
