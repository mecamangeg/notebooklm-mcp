I. CAPTION
ANITA BUENSUCESO DE LAMERA v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, Eighth Regional District, and JUDGE VALERIANO A. DEL VALLE, G.R. No. L-20299, May 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Anita Buensuceso de Lamera sought to dispossess her tenant, respondent Silderico Buensuceso, from her 4.2225-hectare landholding in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, on the ground of personal cultivation. On December 17, 1960, she sent a notice to the tenant of her intention to cultivate the land personally, which the tenant received on December 20, 1960. As the tenant refused to vacate, the petitioner filed a complaint for ejectment with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) on January 2, 1962. The tenant opposed the ejectment, arguing that the petitioner and her husband were full-time public school teachers incapable of personal cultivation and that the notice was written in English, a language he did not know [1-4].

The CAR denied the petition, ruling that the petitioner could not personally cultivate the land due to her full-time job and that the notice requirement was not met because it was in English, which the tenant did not understand. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has the *bona fide* intention to personally cultivate the land as required by law to justify dispossession.
2. W/N the notice of dispossession served to the tenant complied with the legal requirements.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner lacked the requisite *bona fide* intention for personal cultivation. Under Section 50 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act (R.A. 1199), dispossession is allowed only if the landowner or their relative within the first degree intends to cultivate the land "personally or through the employment of farm machinery and implements." The petitioner admitted that she and her husband would not work the land themselves but would employ "hargas" or paid helpers. The law excludes cultivation by hired helpers to prevent circumvention of the tenant's security of tenure [5].

2. **NO.** The notice did not satisfy the legal requirement that it be in a language or dialect known to the tenant. Although the action was brought within the statutory period (more than one year but less than two years from notice), the notice was written in English, which the tenant did not know. The CAR's factual finding that the tenant did not know English—despite having finished fourth grade in the 1920s and serving as an election inspector—was supported by substantial evidence and is binding on appeal [6-8].

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed [8].
