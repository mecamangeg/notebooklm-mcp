I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. MARITIME COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL., MANILA PORT SERVICE AND/OR MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22534, August 9, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Standard Chemical Co., Inc. shipped 1,300 packages of raw materials from New York to Ed. A. Keller & Co., Ltd. (consignee) in Manila aboard the SS "Philippine Bataan" [1]. The vessel arrived on May 10, 1962, and the consignee, upon learning of loss or damage, immediately filed a provisional claim with the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), on that same day [1, 2]. The discharge of the cargo was completed three days later, on May 13, 1962 [1]. A subsequent bad order examination confirmed damage to the goods [3].

When MPS failed to pay the formal claim, the Insurance Company of North America (insurer) paid the consignee and sued MPS and the Maritime Company of the Philippines as subrogee [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila absolved the Maritime Company but ordered MPS to pay [5]. MPS appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was premature and invalid under Section 15 of the Arrastre-Management Contract because it was filed before the discharge of the last package [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed by the consignee before the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel is premature and invalid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that the provisional claim was timely and valid [7, 8].

The Court held that the purpose of the 15-day period in Section 15 of the Arrastre-Management Contract is to afford the arrastre operator a reasonable opportunity to check the validity of claims while facts are fresh [7]. A strict and literal application of the proviso should not be followed if it defeats this purpose [2]. Relying on *Yu Kimteng Construction Corp. v. Manila Port Service*, the Court ruled that the period for filing a claim commences from the date the consignee learns of the loss, damage, or misdelivery, not necessarily from the date of discharge [2].

Since the consignee acquired knowledge of the damage during the discharge and immediately filed a claim, the purpose of the requirement was served, and the act constituted diligence rather than prematurity [2, 7]. The Court distinguished this from claims filed before the vessel's arrival or before the consignee had any knowledge of damage, which are considered premature [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred. Justice Barrera took no part [8].
