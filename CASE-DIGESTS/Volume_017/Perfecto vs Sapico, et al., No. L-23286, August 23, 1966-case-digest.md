I. CAPTION
QUERUBIN PERFECTO v. ALFREDO SAPICO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23286, August 23, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections, Querubin Perfecto and Alfredo Sapico ran for Vice-Mayor of Caramoran, Catanduanes. The Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Sapico the winner with 817 votes against Perfecto’s 813. Perfecto filed an election protest regarding Precinct No. 16. After revision, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Catanduanes credited Perfecto with 826 votes and Sapico with 818, declaring Perfecto the winner.

Sapico appealed, arguing that the CFI erred in: (1) rejecting Exhibit N, a ballot containing "Sasablo," which Sapico claimed read "Sasapco" and was *idem sonans* with his surname; and (2) validly crediting ballots (Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9) containing "Ruben" or its variations to Perfecto. Sapico alleged these were marked ballots because Perfecto admitted "Ruben" was used to identify voters.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI erred in rejecting Exhibit N ("Sasablo") as a stray vote.
2. W/N the CFI erred in crediting votes for "Ruben" to Perfecto.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The appeal on this point raises a question of fact, which is not allowed. Under Section 178 of Republic Act No. 180, decisions of the Court of First Instance in election protests affecting the position of vice-mayor in regular municipalities are not appealable except on pure questions of law (*Calano v. Cruz*; *Tumakay v. Orbiso*). The determination of whether a name written on a ballot is "Sasablo" or "Sasapco" is a question of fact (*Florido v. Velez*). Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that the ballot clearly read "Sasablo," which is not *idem sonans* with Sapico.

2. **NO.** Sapico's claim that Perfecto admitted to using the name "Ruben" to identify voters is without merit. The Court clarified that Perfecto’s testimony meant that the *candidate* voted for could be identified when "Ruben" was written, not the *voter*. The Court held that "Ruben" is *idem sonans* with Querubin, and the variations found on the ballots (e.g., "R. Ferfecto", "Roben") were valid votes for Perfecto.

**Decision affirmed.**
