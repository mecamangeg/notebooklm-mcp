I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MODESTO R. RAMOLETE and QUIRICO DEL MAR, G.R. No. L-24672, August 12, 1966, 17 SCRA 892, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Quirico Del Mar filed a petition for mandamus against the Philippine Veterans Administration (PVA) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu (presided by Respondent Judge Ramolete) to compel payment of back pensions, which were discontinued because he received similar benefits from the U.S. Government [1]. The CFI rendered judgment ordering the PVA to pay the back pensions [2]. The Solicitor General, representing the PVA, filed a notice of appeal [2]. Del Mar moved for execution, arguing that the appeal was not perfected because the PVA failed to file an appeal bond [2]. The CFI ruled that the PVA was not exempt from filing an appeal bond and subsequently declared the judgment final and executory [2]. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul the CFI's orders and compel the judge to give due course to the appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Philippine Veterans Administration (PVA) is exempt from filing an appeal bond.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the PVA is an entity or agency of the Republic of the Philippines embraced within the term "Government of the Philippines" [4]. Under Republic Act No. 2664, the PVA is under the Office of the President and performs governmental functions relating to the administration of veterans' benefits [5], [4].

The Court applied the doctrine that a charge against the Government involving public funds is a suit against the Government itself [6]. Since the suit for back pensions is effectively against the Republic, the PVA shares the Government's exemption from filing an appeal bond pursuant to Section 16, Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court [6]. Consequently, the CFI erred in declaring the judgment final. The petition was granted, the challenged orders were set aside, and the respondent court was ordered to certify the appeal [7].
