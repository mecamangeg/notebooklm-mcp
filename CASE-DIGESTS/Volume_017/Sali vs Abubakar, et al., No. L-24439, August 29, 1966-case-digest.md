I. CAPTION
GOVERNOR HADJI ABSAD SALI vs. BENJAMIN ABUBAKAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24439, August 29, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In an election protest filed by Benjamin Abubakar against Governor Hadji Arsad Sali regarding the office of Provincial Governor of Sulu, the Court of First Instance of Sulu authorized Abubakar to avail of handwriting and thumbmark experts to examine the contested ballots. Abubakar secured the services of experts from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). Subsequently, Sali filed a separate petition (Special Remedy No. 92) to enjoin the NBI agents from conducting the examination and to declare their findings null and void. The lower court ruled in favor of Sali, declaring the NBI examination null and void. It held that under Republic Act No. 157, the NBI is only authorized to extend technical aid to government entities and law enforcement, not to private litigants in civil cases. Abubakar appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the expert examination of ballots conducted by NBI agents at the request of a private litigant is null and void.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court reasoned that the question of whether a public official, such as an NBI agent, may be permitted by his superior to examine documents for a private litigant is essentially administrative in character. It is within the competence of the Bureau Director or Department Head to decide and is independent of the validity of the examination itself [1].

Even assuming, arguendo, that the NBI is not legally authorized to aid private litigants, this does not nullify the examination results. The purpose of such examination is to assist the court in settling the correct issues relative to the documents [2]. The Court held that any person, expert or not, may testify on matters within their personal knowledge relevant to a suit. Such testimony is subject to the judicial authority to determine its credibility and weight, not its validity based on administrative permissions [1].

The order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the complaint dismissed.
