I. CAPTION
**ANG PUE (alias VICENTE TAN) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-16459, July 26, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 24, 1958, Ang Pue, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed to have arrived in the Philippines in 1933 and resided in Iloilo City for at least one year prior to the petition. He was married to a resident of Hong Kong and had two children, born in China in 1941 and 1945, respectively. His children never stayed in the Philippines, as he claimed to have come to the country alone [1]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo admitted him to Philippine citizenship [2]. The Republic appealed, contending that Ang Pue failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of enrolling his children in Philippine schools [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from naturalization due to his failure to enroll his minor children in Philippine schools.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that Section 2, paragraph 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, which requires an applicant to enroll his minor children of school age in recognized Philippine schools where Philippine history, government, and civics are taught, is mandatory [3]. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes a valid ground for denying the petition [3].

The Court reiterated that excuses such as the civil war in China or the strictness of Philippine immigration laws are not valid justifications for non-compliance, citing *Chan v. Republic*, *Tan v. Republic*, and *Sy Kiap v. Republic* [3]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the birth of the petitioner's children in China in 1941 and 1945 contradicted his claim of continuous residence in the Philippines since 1933 [4].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the application for naturalization is dismissed [4].
