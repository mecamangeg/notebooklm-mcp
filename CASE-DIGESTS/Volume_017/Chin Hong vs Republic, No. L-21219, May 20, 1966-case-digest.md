I. CAPTION
**UY CHIN HONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21219, May 20, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Uy Chin Hong (baptized Jaime Uy), a Chinese national born in Cebu City in 1938, filed a petition for naturalization. He claimed exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention, asserting birth in the Philippines and completion of primary and secondary education at Cebu Chinese High School and the University of Southern Philippines. He presented Eustacio Chiong Veloso as a character witness. Veloso was the auditor of the petitioner's family business, received "good pay" from them, and admitted testifying because the petitioner was one of the owners. Veloso had only met the petitioner once or twice a month and did not know basic details such as the petitioner's college course or the correct number of his siblings. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing the petitioner was not exempt from filing the declaration and that the witness was not credible.

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention.
2. W/N the character witness is credible and competent.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not exempt. The Court held that to be exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention, an applicant must prove that the school where they attended elementary education was not limited to any race or nationality. The record was bereft of evidence that the Cebu Chinese High School was not limited to any race or nationality or had Filipino students at the time the petitioner studied there. Citing *Lee Ng Len v. Republic*, the failure to prove this requirement defeats the exemption.

2. **NO.** The character witness was not credible. The Court found that a vouching witness must have intimate knowledge of the applicant. Eustacio Chiong Veloso's acquaintance with the petitioner was slight and based primarily on professional dealings, which *Tan San v. Republic* establishes is insufficient. Furthermore, Veloso was biased due to his employment with the petitioner's family business and his testimony was generalized and rote.

Accordingly, the decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED**.
