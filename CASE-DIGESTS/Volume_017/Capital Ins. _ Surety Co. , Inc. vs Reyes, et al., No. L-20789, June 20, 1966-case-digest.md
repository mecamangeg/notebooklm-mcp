I. CAPTION
CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC. v. HON. LUIS B. REYES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20789, June 20, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Pacita Tuason-Principe and Federico Principe filed an unlawful detainer case against Isidra de Leon in the Municipal Court of Manila. The court ruled in favor of the spouses, ordering De Leon to vacate and pay back rentals [1]. De Leon appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) and filed a supersedeas bond posted by petitioner Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. to stay execution [2]. The bond stipulated that the surety would pay the judgment if it was "affirmed in whole or in part," or if the appeal was abandoned, withdrawn, dismissed, or declared improperly allowed [2, 3].

During the appeal, the spouses moved for execution against De Leon for failing to deposit rentals accruing during the pendency of the appeal. The motion was granted. Subsequently, the spouses filed a motion for execution *against the Surety* on the supersedeas bond, which respondent Judge Reyes granted [4]. The Surety filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge acted in excess of jurisdiction because the conditions of the bond had not yet been met [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the supersedeas bond may be executed against the surety due to the defendant-appellant's failure to pay current rentals while the appeal is still pending.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the obligations of the surety are strictly governed by the specific terms and conditions of the supersedeas bond [5]. The bond in this case conditioned liability on the judgment being "affirmed in whole or in part," or the appeal being abandoned, withdrawn, dismissed, or declared improperly allowed [5].

At the time the execution order was issued, the appeal was still pending in the CFI; none of the stipulated conditions had materialized [5]. While Section 8 of Rule 70 allows for execution of judgment against a *defendant* who fails to pay current rentals during an appeal, this rule does not automatically extend to the *surety* if the bond's contractual terms do not cover such a scenario [5, 6]. The Court distinguished the present case from *Romero v. Pecson* and *Villaroman v. Abaya*, noting those cases involved the liability of defendants, not sureties [5].

Petition granted; the writ of execution is set aside.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J.** (Concurring):
Justice Dizon concurred solely because the surety's liability is determined by the specific terms accepted in the bond. However, he noted that the bond's terms were actually defective and not in accordance with Rule 70, Section 8, which intends for the supersedeas bond to secure rents and damages down to the time of the judgment. Nonetheless, since the surety cannot be held liable beyond the terms it signed, the writ was properly set aside [7, 8].
