I. CAPTION
GREGORIO V. GAERLAN, JR. v. LUIS C. CATUBIG, G.R. No. L-23964, June 1, 1966, 17 SCRA 377, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the 1963 elections for the eight-seat City Council of Dagupan City, respondent Catubig obtained the third-highest number of votes and was proclaimed elected. Petitioner Gaerlan, a fellow candidate, lost and placed 16th. Gaerlan filed a petition for *quo warranto* challenging Catubig's eligibility on the ground of non-age. At the time of filing his candidacy, the election, and his assumption of office, Catubig was 24 years old. Catubig argued that under the Dagupan City Charter (R.A. 170), the minimum age is 23. Gaerlan argued that R.A. 2259, a later law, raised the age limit to 25. Catubig also questioned Gaerlan’s standing, arguing that since Gaerlan lost badly, he had no claim to the office even if Catubig was ousted. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Gaerlan, declaring Catubig ineligible.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a losing candidate who has no right to succeed to the office has standing to file a *quo warranto* petition against an elected official.
2. W/N the respondent is disqualified from the position of City Councilor due to age.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 173 of the Revised Election Code expressly allows "any registered candidate for the same office" to contest the right of a person elected to a provincial or municipal office on the ground of ineligibility [1, 2]. The law does not require that the contestant be entitled to occupy the office should the *quo warranto* prosper [2]. The Court distinguished this from *quo warranto* involving appointive offices; in elective offices, the issue is solely the eligibility of the candidate-elect, not who is entitled to the seat [3].

2. **YES.** R.A. 2259, which mandates that city councilors must be at least 25 years of age, impliedly repealed the inconsistent provision of the Dagupan City Charter (R.A. 170) which set the age at 23 [4, 5]. R.A. 2259 is a later general law intended to apply to all chartered cities not expressly excepted, and Dagupan was not excepted [5]. Furthermore, since councilors may succeed the City Mayor (who must be 25), the legislative scheme requires uniformity in age to avoid an anomaly where a successor-Mayor is underage [6]. Respondent was under 25 at all material times and is thus disqualified [7].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
