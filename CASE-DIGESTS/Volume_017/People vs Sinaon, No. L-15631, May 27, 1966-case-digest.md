I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HERMOSO SINAON, G.R. No. L-15631, May 27, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On July 18, 1958, at around 7:00 P.M., four malefactors, three of whom were armed, broke into the house of Manuel Isogan in Jaro, Iloilo. One robber, Jose Solatorio, demanded money from Manuel. As Manuel handed over P33.00, the appellant Hermoso Sinaon entered through the kitchen, snatched the money, and dragged Manuel's daughter, Felisa, to the balcony where he removed her pants and attempted to abuse her. Manuel ordered his sons, Juan and Marcos, to fight the intruders. During the struggle, Marcos Isogan and Bonifacio Galas were wounded, and Rogelio Gregory sustained gunshot wounds from Solatorio’s carbine, causing his death two days later. Juan Isogan managed to kill Solatorio, while Sinaon and the other companions escaped.

Sinaon was later arrested and positively identified by the victims. He interposed the defense of alibi, claiming he was in another barrio delivering *tuba* and sleeping at his grandmother’s house. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted him of robbery with homicide and physical injuries, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. Sinaon appealed, questioning the credibility of the witnesses.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in convicting the appellant based on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses over the defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The Court reiterated the rule that appellate courts generally do not disturb the trial court's findings on witness credibility, as the trial judge is in a better position to observe the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying [1]. The appellant was positively identified by the victims—Juan, Marcos, and Felisa Isogan—as the intruder who entered through the kitchen, snatched the money, and attacked Felisa [2]. This positive identification prevails over the appellant's weak and unconvincing alibi [3, 4].

The Court found the appellant guilty of robbery with homicide and physical injuries, aggravated by **nocturnity** (as the malefactors took advantage of the 7:00 P.M. darkness), **dwelling**, and **abuse of superior strength** [5]. Although these aggravating circumstances justified the death penalty, the lack of necessary votes resulted in the imposition of the next lower penalty, *reclusion perpetua* [6]. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed [6].
