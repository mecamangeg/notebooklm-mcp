I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VENANCIO SULLANO**, G.R. No. L-18209, June 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Venancio Sullano was the Secretary-Treasurer of the Santa Barbara Farmers Cooperative Marketing Association (FACOMA), which was organized in February 1956 but only registered its Articles of Incorporation and affiliated with the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA) on May 11, 1956. An audit by ACCFA examiners revealed that Sullano had a cash shortage of P5,070.98 as of May 31, 1957. Despite demands from ACCFA to account for and restore the missing funds, Sullano failed to do so.

Sullano was charged with *estafa* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo. In his defense, he argued that certain funds (totaling P2,000.00) included in the shortage computation were deposited with the Municipal Treasurer "for safekeeping" prior to the FACOMA's affiliation with ACCFA on May 11, 1956. He contended these were not ACCFA funds. The CFI convicted Sullano of *estafa*. He appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the funds deposited prior to the FACOMA's registration and affiliation with ACCFA are considered ACCFA funds for the purpose of the *estafa* charge.
2. W/N the prosecution sufficiently proved misappropriation despite not pinpointing the specific items or time of conversion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that prior to the registration of its Articles of Incorporation on May 11, 1956, the Santa Barbara FACOMA had no legal personality or existence under Section 3 of Public Act 3425 (Cooperative Marketing Law). Consequently, the funds deposited earlier with the Municipal Treasurer were merely held for safekeeping for the proposed association. Since the FACOMA affiliated with the ACCFA on the same day it acquired legal existence, these pre-existing funds were correctly treated as ACCFA funds. Sullano, as Secretary-Treasurer, withdrew these funds after the FACOMA was legally established and was accountable for them.

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that it was not necessary to pinpoint the specific items misappropriated or the specific time of misappropriation. It suffices that the accused was shown beyond reasonable doubt to be short in his cash accountability. Citing *Tubb v. People* (101 Phil. 114), the Court reiterated that failure to account upon demand for funds or property held in trust constitutes circumstantial evidence of misappropriation. Sullano's inability to explain or cover the P5,070.98 shortage upon demand established his liability.

**Judgment affirmed.**
