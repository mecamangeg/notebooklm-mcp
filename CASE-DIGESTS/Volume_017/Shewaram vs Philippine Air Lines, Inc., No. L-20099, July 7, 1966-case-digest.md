**I. CAPTION**
PARMANAND SHEWARAM v. PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC., G.R. No. L-20099, July 7, 1966, Zaldivar, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
On November 23, 1959, Parmanand Shewaram was a passenger on a Philippine Air Lines (PAL) flight from Zamboanga City to Manila. He checked in a suitcase which was mistagged by PAL personnel to Iligan instead of Manila [3]. The suitcase arrived in Manila the following day, November 24, but Shewaram discovered that his Transistor Radio 7 and Rollflex Camera were missing [3, 4]. The trial court found that the suitcase had been tampered with and the items lost due to the negligence of PAL employees [5, 6].

Shewaram filed suit for damages. The Municipal Court of Zamboanga City awarded actual damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees [2]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zamboanga City modified the judgment, awarding Shewaram Php 373.00 in actual damages (the value of the lost items) and attorney's fees, but eliminating exemplary damages [7]. PAL appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law, arguing that under the conditions printed at the back of the ticket stub, its liability was limited to Php 100.00 unless a higher value was declared [3, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Shewaram is bound by the provision printed at the back of the airline ticket limiting PAL's liability to Php 100.00. [8, 9]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that Shewaram is not bound by the liability limitation.

Under Article 1750 of the New Civil Code, a contract limiting a common carrier's liability must be "reasonable and just under the circumstances and has been fairly and freely agreed upon" [9, 10]. The Court found that these requirements were not met because the conditions were printed at the back of the ticket stub in letters so small that they were hard to read [10]. Consequently, it cannot be presumed that the passenger was aware of the conditions or that he "fairly and freely agreed" to them, especially since he did not sign the ticket [10].

Furthermore, the Court held that PAL is liable under Articles 1734 and 1735 of the New Civil Code, which presume common carriers to be at fault or negligent when goods are lost, unless they prove extraordinary diligence [11, 12]. Since the loss was due to the negligence of PAL's employees, the carrier cannot limit its liability. Citing *Ysmael and Co. v. Barreto*, the Court reiterated that a carrier cannot lawfully stipulate for exemption from liability for loss caused by its own negligence [13, 14].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [15].
