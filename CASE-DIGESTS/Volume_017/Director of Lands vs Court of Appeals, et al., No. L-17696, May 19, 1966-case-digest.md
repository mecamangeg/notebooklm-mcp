I. CAPTION
DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. THE COURT OF APPEALS, BRAULIO COSME and DAMASO A. ACOSTA, G.R. No. L-17696, May 19, 1966, 17 SCRA 71, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In 1926, Benito Tolentino filed a sales application for a tract of agricultural land in Isabela. The land was awarded to him in 1928 following a public bidding. By 1950, Tolentino had complied with all requirements, and the Director of Lands signed the order for the issuance of a patent. However, it was discovered that a portion of the land (Lot No. 8091) had been applied for as a homestead by respondent Braulio Cosme in March 1949. A homestead patent and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-880 were issued to Cosme in November 1949.

Upon investigation verifying that Cosme's patent covered land previously awarded to Tolentino, the Director of Lands filed an action in 1953 to cancel Cosme's patent and title. Intervenor Damaso Acosta claimed he purchased the lot from Cosme in 1957. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ordered the cancellation of Cosme's title and the reversion of the land to the public domain. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, ruling that under Section 38 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), Cosme’s title became incontrovertible after the lapse of one year from its issuance.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government can cancel a homestead patent and certificate of title after the lapse of one year from its issuance on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the one-year period provided in Section 38 of Act No. 496 regarding the incontrovertibility of a certificate of title does not apply when the action is for the cancellation of a patent and title on the ground that they are void because the Bureau of Lands had no jurisdiction to issue them [1-3].

The Court explained that the award of the land to Tolentino in 1928 conferred upon him the right to take possession and effectively withdrew the land from the disposable public domain [4]. Consequently, when Cosme filed his application in 1949, the Director of Lands no longer had jurisdiction to dispose of the land [3, 5]. Unlike a title acquired through judicial proceedings, a certificate of title based on a patent is still subject to certain restrictions and may be cancelled if the land was not disposable at the time of issuance [6].

The Court distinguished this case from *Lucas v. Durian*, noting that the indefeasibility doctrine applies only when the land disposed of is really part of the disposable public domain [4, 7]. Furthermore, intervenor Acosta was not an innocent purchaser for value as he bought the land three years after the cancellation suit was filed [8].

**The amended decision of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED and the decision of the Court of First Instance is AFFIRMED.**
