I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CESAR REYES Y ENGRESO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19894, May 27, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 20, 1958, robbers entered the Pangan residence in Quezon City, threatened the family, and looted valuables. During the incident, Dr. Manuel Pangan was shot and killed in the driveway [1, 2]. Police found two empty cartridges at the scene [2]. Months later, appellant Cesar Reyes was arrested for illegal possession of firearms. Ballistics tests confirmed the empty cartridges found at the crime scene matched the gun confiscated from Reyes [3]. Reyes executed an extrajudicial confession in the presence of police and newspaper reporters, admitting his participation, and later affirmed the same before the City Fiscal [3, 4].

The Court of First Instance convicted Reyes of robbery with homicide, relying primarily on his confession and the ballistics evidence. Reyes appealed, claiming his confession was coerced through maltreatment and setting up the defense of alibi [5-8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confession was voluntarily executed and sufficient to sustain a conviction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found the confession to be voluntary. Reyes signed the confession in the presence of reporters and affirmed it before the City Fiscal, failing to present medical evidence of the alleged maltreatment [4, 9].

An extrajudicial confession suffices to convict if corroborated by evidence of *corpus delicti* (Section 3, Rule 133, Rules of Court) [7]. The *corpus delicti*—the fact of robbery with homicide—was established by the testimony of the victims and the medico-legal report [6]. The confession was corroborated by physical evidence, specifically the ballistics match between the shells found at the scene and the gun in Reyes' possession, as well as the correspondence between the stolen articles and those mentioned in the confession [10]. Consequently, the defense of alibi failed in the face of the voluntary confession and corroborating evidence [8].

The judgment of the lower court imposing *reclusion perpetua* is affirmed [11, 12].
