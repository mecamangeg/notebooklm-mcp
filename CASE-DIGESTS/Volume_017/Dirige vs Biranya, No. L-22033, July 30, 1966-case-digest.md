I. CAPTION
MARIA FLOR V. DIRIGE v. VICTORIANO BIRANYA, G.R. No. L-22033, July 30, 1966, 17 SCRA 840, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Dirige appealed a forcible entry case dismissal to the Court of First Instance (CFI). On October 30, 1959, the notice of the appealed case was received by the son of defendant Biranya. Biranya failed to answer the complaint. On July 8, 1960, the trial court declared Biranya in default. On July 21, 1960, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, and the judgment was **entered** by the Clerk of Court on the same day.

On February 24, 1961, Biranya filed a petition for relief from judgment. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that the six-month reglementary period had elapsed counting from the date of the default order (July 8, 1960). Biranya appealed, arguing that: (1) the default was void because notice was sent to him personally rather than his lawyer; and (2) the petition was timely because the six-month period should be counted from the finality of the judgment, not the default order.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the notice of the appealed case sent to the party personally, instead of his counsel, is valid.
2. W/N the petition for relief was filed within the reglementary period of six months.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 7, Rule 40 of the old Rules of Court (applicable at the time), once a case is docketed on appeal, it is the duty of the clerk to notify the **parties** of that fact. This provision is express and specific and cannot be interpreted to mean notice to the lawyer alone. Furthermore, the record showed that Biranya's counsel had not entered a formal appearance in the lower court; appearance at trial alone is insufficient to entitle counsel to notice.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court clarified divergent jurisprudence and ruled that under Section 3, Rule 38, the six-month period for filing a petition for relief is reckoned from the date the judgment or order was **entered**. The rule strictly states "entered," not rendered or finalized. Since the judgment was entered on July 21, 1960, and the petition was filed on February 24, 1961, more than six months had elapsed. Consequently, the remedy was lost. The Court also noted that mere forgetfulness of the party (or his son) does not constitute excusable negligence.

The Order of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
