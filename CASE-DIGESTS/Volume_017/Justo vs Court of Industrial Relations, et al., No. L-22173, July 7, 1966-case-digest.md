I. CAPTION
JUAN JUSTO v. THE HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TEODORO SEMODIO, G.R. No. L-22173, July 7, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Teodoro Semodio filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against Petitioner Juan Justo, a rice mill owner, for the recovery of differential pay, overtime pay, and separation pay [1, 2]. Semodio alleged he was summarily dismissed without just cause or notice [3]. Crucially, the original complaint did not include a prayer for reinstatement [4]. Justo filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, which the CIR denied [5]. Subsequently, Semodio moved to amend his petition to include a claim for reinstatement to confer jurisdiction upon the CIR [5]. Over Justo's opposition, the CIR admitted the amendment and eventually rendered a decision ordering reinstatement and payment of overtime pay [5-7]. Justo appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over money claims where the employer-employee relationship has ended and no reinstatement is sought.
2. W/N the complaint could be amended to confer jurisdiction upon the court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction over cases for recovery of differential pay, separation pay, and overtime pay where the employer-employee relationship has terminated and the petitioner does not ask for reinstatement [8, 9]. Because the original petition nowhere stated a claim for reinstatement, the CIR was devoid of jurisdiction from the outset [4].

2. **NO.** The Court applied the settled rule that where it appears from the face of the complaint that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, an amendment of the complaint so as to confer jurisdiction upon the court cannot be allowed [4, 10]. Citing *Rosario v. Carandang* and *Campos Rueda Corp. v. Bautista*, the Court reasoned that since the CIR had no jurisdiction to act in the case at all, it had no jurisdiction to allow amendments of pleadings therein [4, 11].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the petition is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction [11].
