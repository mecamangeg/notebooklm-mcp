I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. JULIO LIM alias JUAN TAN alias JULIONG LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20811, July 26, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Julio Lim (also known as Juan Tan, Juliong Lim, and Julio Y. Lim) filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance. The Republic appealed the decision on three grounds. First, regarding his finances, the petitioner had a wife and four children but only earned an average monthly income of P300.00 (P250.00 at the time of filing). Second, the petitioner used multiple names and aliases, including "Juliong Tan" in a NICA check-up, without judicial authorization. Third, although the petitioner was born in Malitbog, Leyte, he failed to present evidence of his actual name as recorded in the civil register.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner met the lucrative income requirement for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner's unauthorized use of aliases is a violation of the law.
3. W/N the failure to prove one's true name in the civil register bars the grant of citizenship.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual income of P3,600.00 does not meet the statutory requirement of a lucrative income, even for a single individual (*Uy v. Republic*). The petitioner, having a wife and four children to support, is in a significantly worse position [1].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the petitioner's use of diverse names without judicial authorization constitutes a violation of Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 142, which regulates the use of aliases. This violation is sufficient ground to deny naturalization (*Wayne Chang v. Republic*) [2].

3. **YES.** The Court established that for legal purposes, a person's real name is that which appears in the civil register (*Ng Yao Siong v. Republic*). Consequently, the absence of sufficient evidence regarding the petitioner's true name as recorded in the civil register bars the grant of citizenship [3].

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed; petition denied. Costs against petitioner.
