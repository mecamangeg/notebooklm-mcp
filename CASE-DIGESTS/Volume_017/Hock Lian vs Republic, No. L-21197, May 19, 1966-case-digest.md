I. CAPTION
ONG HOCK LIAN *alias* JULIAN ONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21197, May 19, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ong Hock Lian, a citizen of the Republic of China, arrived in the Philippines in 1927 and has resided in Dumaguete City since 1940. He is a merchant with a store selling rice and corn, owning two cargo trucks. He is married with three children. His reported net income was P5,939.36 in 1958, P4,114.49 in 1959, and P5,659.30 in 1960 [1]. Aside from his name "Ong Hock Lian," he uses the alias "Julian Ong" [2].

He filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental granted. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing, among others, that the petitioner used an alias without authority and lacked a lucrative occupation [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner violated the Anti-Alias Law.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner violated the Anti-Alias Law (Commonwealth Act No. 142). The law prohibits using any name different from the one with which a person was christened, known by since childhood, or authorized by a competent court. There was no evidence that the petitioner was baptized as "Julian Ong," known by it since childhood, or authorized by a court to use it [2].

2. **NO.** The petitioner failed to satisfy the requirement of a lucrative occupation. With a wife and three children to support, he earned less than P6,000 a year, and his income actually decreased from 1958 to 1960 [4]. The Court cited *Tan v. Republic* (L-16013), holding that an income of P6,300 for an applicant supporting a wife and one child falls short of the legal requirement [4]. Although the petitioner claimed he drew a salary of P300 a month from his store, he failed to report this in his income tax returns. Consequently, this amount could not be considered part of his income, and the failure to report it cast grave doubt on his veracity [5].

**judgment reversed and petition denied.**
