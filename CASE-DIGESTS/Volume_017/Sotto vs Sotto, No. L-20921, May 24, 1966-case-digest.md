I. CAPTION
MARCELO SOTTO v. FILEMON SOTTO, G.R. No. L-20921, May 24, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Marcelo Sotto filed a complaint against Filemon Sotto to be declared an illegitimate (spurious) son based on his continuous possession of the status of an acknowledged spurious child. Due to Filemon’s advanced age and mental incapacity, he was represented by guardians, including the appellant Dr. Suga Sotto Yuvienco. The trial court found that Filemon, while married, cohabited with Marcelo's mother, Jovita Butalid; that Marcelo was born of this union; and that Filemon supported Marcelo’s education and treated him as a son [1-3]. The trial court ruled in favor of Marcelo. Yuvienco appealed directly to the Supreme Court, assailing the lower court's factual findings and the denial of her motion to reopen the case [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appellant may raise questions of fact in a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N an action to declare a child illegitimate (spurious) is maintainable despite the lack of an explicit legal provision.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** When a decision of the Court of First Instance is appealed directly to the Supreme Court, the appellant is deemed to have waived the right to raise issues of fact [7, 8]. The appeal must be confined to questions of law; otherwise, jurisdiction would lie with the Court of Appeals [8]. Consequently, the Court is bound by the lower court's findings—supported by uncontradicted testimony—that the plaintiff enjoyed the continuous status of an acknowledged spurious child [5].

2. **YES.** Although there is no legal provision explicitly authorizing an action to declare a child an illegitimate one, there is likewise no law to the contrary [9-11]. While there are doubts as to whether a spurious child may establish filiation based on possession of status *after* the alleged father's death (*Zuzuarregui v. Zuzuarregui*), this limitation does not apply where the action is instituted during the lifetime of the putative father (represented here by guardians) to establish status for future rights [11].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [12].
