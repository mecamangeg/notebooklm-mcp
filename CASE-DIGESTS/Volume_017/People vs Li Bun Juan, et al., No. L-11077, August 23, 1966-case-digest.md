I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LI BUN JUAN alias BUN HUAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11077, August 23, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 13, 1946, Dr. Yu Kiatming was shot and killed at his home in Manila. The crime remained unsolved until October 22, 1953, when appellant Li Bun Juan was arrested by police for acting suspiciously and concealing a weapon. A search of his person revealed a note in Chinese characters linking him to the pistol used in the 1946 murder. Confronted with this, Li Bun Juan broke down and executed three extrajudicial confessions admitting his participation.

The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted Li Bun Juan of murder, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. On appeal, Li Bun Juan argued that his confessions were obtained through violence and intimidation. He also contended that the trial court should have disregarded the testimony of the arresting officers under the principle of *falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus*, as their testimony regarding a co-accused (Ong Tong To) was not given full credit resulting in that co-accused's acquittal. Finally, he argued that the court failed to consider his minority, as he was only 14 years, 9 months, and 9 days old at the time of the commission of the crime.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the extrajudicial confessions of the appellant were voluntary and admissible.
2. W/N the principle of *falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus* applies to disregard the testimony of the police witnesses.
3. W/N the appellant is entitled to a penalty reduction due to the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found the confessions to be voluntary. The appellant had ample opportunity to complain to the administering Notary Public regarding the alleged intimidation but instead affirmed the truth of his statements. Furthermore, the Court noted that the confessions contained details that could only be known by the perpetrators and not fabricated by the police. A trial court’s factual conclusion on the voluntariness of a confession is generally not disturbed on appeal unless facts of weight were overlooked.

2. **NO.** The principle *falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus* is not an absolute rule of law. It is perfectly reasonable for a court to believe the testimony of a witness with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts. The fact that the trial court had doubts regarding the evidence against the co-accused Ong Tong To does not automatically discredit the testimony of the police officers regarding Li Bun Juan, especially where their testimony was accepted as truthful by the trial judge.

3. **YES.** The records show the appellant was under 15 years old (specifically 14 years, 9 months, and 9 days) at the time of the crime in 1946. This constitutes a privileged mitigating circumstance entitling him to a one-degree reduction of the penalty. While the crime was Murder (attended by evident premeditation and treachery), the penalty is reduced from *reclusion temporal* in its maximum period to death, down to *prision mayor* in its maximum period to *reclusion temporal* in its medium period.

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Li Bun Juan is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 12 years and one day of *reclusion temporal*.
