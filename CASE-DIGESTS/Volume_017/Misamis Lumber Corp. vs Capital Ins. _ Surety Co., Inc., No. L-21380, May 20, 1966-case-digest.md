I. CAPTION
MISAMIS LUMBER CORPORATION v. CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21380, May 20, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Misamis Lumber Corporation insured its motor vehicle with defendant Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. The insurance policy stipulated that the insured may authorize repairs necessitated by damage provided the estimated cost does not exceed the authorized limit of P150.00, and a detailed estimate is forwarded to the insurer without delay. On November 25, 1961, the insured vehicle was damaged when it hit a water hole. Misamis Lumber had the car repaired by Morosi Motors for P302.27 without notifying the insurer. The accident was reported to Capital Insurance only on November 29, 1961, after repairs were completed. Capital Insurance admitted liability for P150.00 but refused to pay the excess [1-3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Misamis Lumber for the full amount, reasoning that absolving the insurer would render the contract one-sided [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurer’s liability is limited to P150.00 based on the policy stipulation regarding repairs authorized by the insured.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the literal meaning of the policy stipulation must control as it is the actual contract expressly provided for (Art. 1370, Civil Code) [3, 4]. The policy gave the insurer the option to undertake repairs itself, but it was deprived of this option when Misamis Lumber authorized the repairs without prior notice [5, 6]. Consequently, the provision limiting liability to P150.00 applies. The Court emphasized that the fact that an insurance contract is onerous does not justify the abrogation of its express terms which the insured accepted and which constitute the law between the parties [6, 7]. Furthermore, it is unjust to require the insurer to prove the cost of repairs was unreasonable when it was not given the opportunity to inspect the damage [8, 9].

The appealed decision is MODIFIED, ordering Capital Insurance to pay not more than P150.00 to Misamis Lumber [9].
