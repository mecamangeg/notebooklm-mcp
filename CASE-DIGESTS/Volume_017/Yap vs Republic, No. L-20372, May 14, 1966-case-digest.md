I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN YAP alias UY WEI KIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20372, May 14, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benjamin Yap, a citizen of the Republic of China born in Cebu City, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. At the time of filing on December 29, 1960, he was employed at San Su Trading, a firm owned by his uncle, receiving a monthly salary of P200.00 with free board and lodging worth P50.00 [2-4]. He presented Vicente P. Tantuico, the firm's bookkeeper, and Florencio Campos, a former employee, as character witnesses [5]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the character witnesses were not credible and that the petitioner lacked lucrative employment [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s character witnesses were qualified to testify on his character and conduct.
2. W/N the petitioner possessed a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the character witnesses were not qualified because their testimony did not show that their relations with the petitioner were sufficient to enable them to observe his behavior, character, beliefs, and social contacts [4, 7]. Witness Tantuico only saw the petitioner "from time to time" or casually, while witness Campos only saw him during meals or when dropping by the store [8].
2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the possession of a lucrative trade or occupation is determined as of the time of the filing of the petition [4, 9]. Since the petitioner was receiving only P200.00 a month when he filed the petition in 1960, his employment was not considered lucrative, even with free board and lodging [3, 4, 9]. The Court cited *Senecio Dy Ong v. Republic* and *Yap v. Republic* to support this principle [4, 9].

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [10].
