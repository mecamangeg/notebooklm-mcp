I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANG DIT KUE alias ATCHAY ANG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANG DIT KUE alias ATCHAY ANG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15795, June 20, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ang Dit Kue, born in Sulu in 1936, filed a petition for naturalization in 1958. To prove his financial capacity, he claimed he was employed as a bookkeeper earning P250.00 per month, and later employed in a "temporary capacity" at his aunt’s store earning P120.00 per month. He admitted he did not file income tax returns because he was not yet liable for it. To support his petition regarding his moral character, he presented vouching witnesses Luisa Roldan and Tomas Paredo. The Court of First Instance of Sulu granted the petition. The Republic appealed, challenging the reliability of the witnesses and the sufficiency of the petitioner's income.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the vouching witnesses were competent and credible.
2. W/N the petitioner met the requirement of having a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the witnesses were not credible persons within the meaning of the Naturalization Law. Witness Roldan admitted a total absence of knowledge regarding the petitioner's qualifications and disqualifications, which incapacitated her as a vouching witness. Furthermore, the statements made by the witnesses in their joint affidavit varied significantly from their testimonies in court, rendering their words unreliable. The Court cited *Ong v. Republic* (103 Phil. 964), ruling that such variance prevents witnesses from being considered "credible persons."

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner failed to satisfy the statutory requirement of a lucrative calling. Citing numerous precedents, the Court held that an income of P250.00 a month is not sufficient. The petitioner's failure to file an income tax return confirmed that his income was low. Moreover, his employment by his aunt was admittedly "temporary" and uncertain, making the likelihood of him becoming a public charge not far-fetched despite his savings and education.

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED**.
