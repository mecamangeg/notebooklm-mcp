I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ARMANDO FAJARDO Y GALANG and VICENTE LIWANAG Y MARCELO, G.R. No. L-18257, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Defendants Fajardo and Liwanag were charged with violation of Section 878 of the Revised Administrative Code for illegal possession of a "paltik" (homemade revolver) [1, 2]. After pleading not guilty, they filed a motion to quash, arguing that two persons cannot be held responsible for possessing one firearm and that a "paltik" is not a firearm for which a license can be issued [2, 3]. The trial court found the motion meritorious and ordered the Assistant Fiscal to file an amended information within five days [4]. When the Fiscal failed to amend, the court dismissed the case provisionally [5]. The prosecution appealed, but the defendants argued the appeal would place them in double jeopardy [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a "paltik" is a firearm and if two persons can be charged with its illegal possession.
2. W/N the prosecution's appeal of the dismissal constitutes double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A "paltik" is a firearm because it discharges bullets by means of gunpowder, falling under the definition in Section 817 of the Revised Penal Code [7]. Furthermore, two persons can be guilty of illegal possession of one firearm because the law punishes not just physical possession but also constructive possession or subjection of the thing to the owner's control [8]. Therefore, the original information charging conspiracy was valid [7, 8].

2. **YES.** The appeal places the defendants in double jeopardy. Under the Rules of Court, the prosecution cannot appeal if it places the defendant in double jeopardy [6]. Here, the dismissal was without the express consent of the accused [9]. While they moved to quash or for reinvestigation, the court granted neither, instead ordering an amendment [9]. The subsequent dismissal due to the prosecution's failure to amend was effectively a denial of the motion to quash and was not an action requested by the accused [9]. Since the information was valid and sufficient, the erroneous dismissal without the defendants' consent bars further prosecution [9].

Appeal dismissed [10].
