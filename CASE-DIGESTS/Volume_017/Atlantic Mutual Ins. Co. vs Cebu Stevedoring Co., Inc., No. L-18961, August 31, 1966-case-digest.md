I. CAPTION
ATLANTIC MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY and CONTINENTAL INSURANCE COMPANY v. CEBU STEVEDORING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-18961, August 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Atlantic Mutual and Continental Insurance are foreign corporations existing under the laws of the United States. They sued Respondent Cebu Stevedoring Co., Inc., a domestic common carrier, for the recovery of P15,980.30 representing the value of damaged copra petitioners paid to the consignee as insurers/subrogees. The Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Petitioners had no legal personality to appear before Philippine courts, arguing that the complaint failed to allege compliance with Section 69 of the Corporation Law, which requires a license for foreign corporations to transact business in the Philippines.

The Court of First Instance of Cebu found the complaint deficient for failing to state that the plaintiffs were duly licensed to transact business in the Philippines and ordered them to amend it. The Petitioners refused to amend, contending that foreign corporations not engaged in business in the Philippines can sue on isolated transactions without a license. Consequently, the lower court dismissed the complaint.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a foreign corporation must affirmatively plead facts showing its capacity to sue (i.e., its license or the isolated nature of the transaction) in its complaint to avoid dismissal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal.

While it is settled that a foreign corporation not "transacting business" in the Philippines may sue on a singular, isolated transaction without a license (*Marshall-Wells Co. v. Elser & Co.*), the plaintiff's capacity to sue must still be affirmatively pleaded. The complaint in this case merely averred that petitioners were foreign corporations. This averment allows for two possibilities: either they are engaged in business in the Philippines (requiring a license) or they are not (requiring the transaction to be isolated).

The Court ruled that the qualifying circumstance—either the possession of a license or the fact that the transaction is isolated—is an essential element of the plaintiff's capacity to sue. Since Section 69 of the Corporation Law denies foreign corporations the right to maintain suits unless they comply with legal requirements, compliance or exemption becomes a necessary averment. It would be unfair to impose the burden on the defendant to prove the plaintiff lacks capacity. This principle is consistent with Section 4, Rule 8 of the Revised Rules of Court, which mandates that facts showing the capacity of a party to sue must be averred.

The orders appealed from are affirmed.
