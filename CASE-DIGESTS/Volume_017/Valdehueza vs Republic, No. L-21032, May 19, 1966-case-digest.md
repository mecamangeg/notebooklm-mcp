I. CAPTION
FRANCISCA GALEOS-VALDEHUEZA, et al. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, et al., G.R. No. L-21032, May 19, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1938, the Government instituted expropriation proceedings over Lots 932 and 939 in Lahug, Cebu, owned by Gervasia and Eulalia Denzon, for a military reservation [1]. After depositing P9,500, the Government took possession [2]. In 1940, the CFI ordered the Republic to pay the owners P4,062.10 [3]. This judgment became final in 1948 after an appeal to the Court of Appeals was dismissed [4]. The records did not show that the Government actually paid the owners, though the deposit was disbursed [5].

In 1961, the petitioners (successors-in-interest of the Denzons) obtained Transfer Certificates of Title over the lots, which bore annotations regarding the Government's right to acquire them [6]. They filed a suit against the Republic and the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) seeking recovery of possession and payment of rentals [7]. The CFI ruled that while the petitioners remained registered owners due to non-payment, they could not recover possession as the lots were subject to the expropriation judgment. The court ordered the Government to pay an adjusted market value of P16,248.40 plus interest, but denied the claim for rentals [8, 9]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners are entitled to recover possession of the expropriated lots due to non-payment of the judgment price.
2. W/N the petitioners are entitled to rentals for the use of the land.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that while the petitioners are still the registered owners because no transfer was effected, they are not entitled to recover possession. The lots were condemned for public use by a final and executory judgment in expropriation proceedings and are currently devoted to public use as an airport [11]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Alfonso v. Pasay City*, stating that a registered owner of property taken for public use is entitled only to demand the fair market value of the property, not the restoration of possession [12].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that in expropriation, compensation for the use of land after taking is not in the form of rentals, but by way of interest from the date the entity takes possession [13]. Citing *Republic v. Garcellano*, the Court affirmed that interest runs until the amounts are paid or deposited in court [13]. Since a deposit was made prior to the final judgment, the lower court correctly awarded interest starting from the date of the final judgment in 1948 [13].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [14].
