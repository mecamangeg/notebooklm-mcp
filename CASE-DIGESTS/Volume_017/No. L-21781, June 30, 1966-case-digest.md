**I. CAPTION**
DELGADO BROTHERS, INC. and DELGADO BROKERAGE CORPORATION v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21781, June 30, 1966, Regala, J. [1, 2]

**II. FACTS**
A shipment of relief supplies consigned to the Catholic Relief Services arrived in Manila on July 4, 1959, with the last package discharged on July 6, 1959 [2]. On July 8, 1959, the plaintiffs filed a provisional claim with the arrastre contractor, Manila Port Service (MPS) [3]. MPS did not act on the claim immediately. On March 17, 1961, MPS finally rejected the claim, arguing it had prescribed because no suit was filed within one year from the date of discharge [3]. Delgado Brokerage paid the consignee for the shortage and filed a complaint against MPS and Manila Railroad Company on May 6, 1961, in the Municipal Court of Manila [4]. The Municipal Court and subsequently the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Delgado Brothers [4, 5]. MPS appealed, contending the suit was barred by the Management Contract, which requires filing suit within one year from the date of discharge or one year from the date of rejection of the claim [5, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the complaint filed on May 6, 1961, was barred by prescription under the Management Contract. [5]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding the suit was filed within the prescriptive period [7, 8].

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Continental Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service*, which interprets the Management Contract's two prescriptive periods: (1) one year from discharge, or (2) one year from rejection of the claim [7, 9]. The Court held that when an arrastre contractor fails to act on a claim within one year from the date of discharge, the claim is deemed constructively rejected as of the expiration of that one-year period [7].

In this case, the date of last discharge was July 6, 1959 [2]. Since MPS failed to act within a year, the claim was deemed rejected on July 6, 1960 [7]. The plaintiffs had one year from this constructive rejection to file suit. The complaint filed on May 6, 1961, was well within one year from July 6, 1960 [7]. Therefore, the action had not prescribed.

**Judgment affirmed.** [8]
