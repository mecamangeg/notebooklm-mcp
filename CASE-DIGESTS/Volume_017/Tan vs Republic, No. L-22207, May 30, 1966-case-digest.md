I. CAPTION
NERIO TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22207, May 30, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Nerio Tan filed an application for naturalization. In his petition, he listed his present residence as Garcia Hernandez, Bohol, but did not state any former places of residence [1]. However, it was established that Tan actually resided in Cebu City for three years while completing a one-year course for radio mechanic (ending March 1958) and a two-year course for radio operator (ending March 1960) [1]. Regarding his financial capacity, Tan's income at the time of filing was an annual salary of P2,400.00 plus a P600.00 commission [2]. The Court of First Instance of Bohol rendered a judgment adverse to Tan [3], [1]. Tan appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to allege a former place of residence (Cebu City) is fatal to the petition.
2. W/N the petitioner's income is lucrative.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the failure to allege a former place of residence is fatal. Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires the petition to state the "present and former places of residence" [4]. The term "residence" encompasses all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided [5], [4]. Cebu City, where the petitioner studied for three years, falls within this scope because information regarding the petitioner and objections to his application are apt to be provided by people in his actual, physical surroundings [6], [4]. The Court cited *Qua v. Republic* and *Chang v. Republic* to support this strict requirement [5], [7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner's income was not lucrative. By judicial standards, an annual income of P2,400.00 for a single individual is below the level of lucrative due to the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of money [8]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the P600.00 commission cannot be included in reckoning income because it is contingent and speculative, citing *Ong Tai v. Republic* [9], [2].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioner [8].
