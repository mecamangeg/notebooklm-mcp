I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ALBINO CHING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-22394, July 9, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 5, 1961, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, Branch VIII, granted petitioner Albino Ching’s application for naturalization [1]. Two years later, Ching filed a motion to present evidence of compliance with Republic Act No. 530 to take his oath of allegiance [1]. By then, the presiding judge of Branch VIII had changed to Judge Barcelona. However, the Secretary of Justice issued Administrative Order No. 28 authorizing Branch II, presided by Judge Leuterio, to hear all cases of Branch VIII during May 1963 [1].

Judge Leuterio set the hearing for June 8, 1963. However, on May 29, 1963, Ching presented his evidence before Branch VI (presided by Judge Cloribel), allegedly with the Solicitor General's consent [2]. Judge Cloribel allowed Ching to take his oath. The next day, Judge Leuterio issued an order nullifying the proceedings before Judge Cloribel for lack of authority [3]. Ching did not appeal this order [4].

In July 1963, hearings resumed before Branch VIII (Judge Barcelona). Evidence revealed Ching had criminal records for traffic violations and faced a reckless imprudence charge [5]. On August 24, 1963, Ching’s counsel sought a postponement, claiming Ching was in Surigao. Judge Barcelona denied the postponement as a delay tactic and dismissed the motion to take the oath [6]. Ching appealed, questioning Judge Leuterio’s authority to annul Judge Cloribel’s order and Judge Barcelona’s denial of the postponement [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the annulment by Judge Leuterio of the proceedings had before Judge Cloribel was proper.
2. W/N Judge Barcelona abused his discretion in denying the motion for postponement and dismissing the petition to take the oath.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that Judge Leuterio had the authority to control the proceedings. First, the petitioner did not appeal Judge Leuterio’s orders, rendering them not subject to review [4]. Second, the case was duly assigned by the Secretary of Justice to Branch II (Judge Leuterio) for that period. Thus, Judge Leuterio had the "bounden duty" to perform his authority, and Judge Cloribel could not deprive him of this power without his consent, nor arrogate such authority to himself [4].

2. **NO.** Motions for postponement are addressed to the "sound discretion of the courts" and should not be interfered with unless abused [8, 9]. The Supreme Court found the discretion was wisely exercised because the postponement was "patently to delay" the disposition of the case [10]. The evidence showed the petitioner had criminal records for speeding, reckless driving, and driving without headlights, which contradicted his qualification for naturalization [5].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, and Sanchez concurred. Justices Zaldivar and Castro took no part [11].
