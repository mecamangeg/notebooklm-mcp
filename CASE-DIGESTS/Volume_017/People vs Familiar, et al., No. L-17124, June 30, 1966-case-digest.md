I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FAMILIAR, et al., G.R. No. L-17124, June 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Rural Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. posted a P6,000 bail bond for the provisional liberty of accused Bonifacio Soriano y Pañgan. On October 24, 1958, Soriano failed to appear for his hearing despite notice [1]. The trial court issued a warrant for his arrest, confiscated the bond, and gave the surety 30 days to produce the accused and show cause why judgment should not be rendered on the bond [1].

On November 18, 1958, within the 30-day period, the surety surrendered Soriano and petitioned to lift the confiscation order, which was initially denied [2]. Upon a motion for reconsideration, the surety agreed to refund the premiums paid by the accused, who claimed he had not been notified of the hearing date [3, 4]. Based on this promise, the court agreed to reconsider [3]. However, the surety failed to refund the premiums [5]. Consequently, the trial court rendered judgment on the bond but reduced the liability from P6,000 to P1,000 [5]. The surety appealed, arguing for total exoneration and questioning the condition to refund premiums [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in making the refund of premiums a condition precedent to lifting the order of confiscation.
2. W/N the surety is entitled to total exoneration because it surrendered the accused within the 30-day period.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the surety is bound by its representative's voluntary agreement to refund the premiums to the accused [7]. The trial court entertained the motion to reconsider the confiscation specifically in consideration of this promise [7]. As the engagement was not shown to be illegal or void, the surety must comply [8, 9].

2. **NO.** Under Section 16(a) of Rule 114 (formerly Rule 110) of the Revised Rules of Court, the cancellation of a bail bond upon surrender of the accused is not ministerial once an order of confiscation has been issued; the provision contemplates surrender *before* default [9, 10]. While courts generally exercise liberality toward bondsmen, this does not extend to totally exonerating a surety who fails to produce the accused when required, thereby causing delay in the trial [10, 11]. Since the surety breached its obligation, it is not entitled to total exoneration, and the reduction of liability to one-sixth of the original amount was proper [11].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [12].
