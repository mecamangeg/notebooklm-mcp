I. CAPTION
TEODORA V. PALISOC v. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21889, July 26, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teodora V. Palisoc was convicted of estafa by the Court of First Instance of Manila and appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The case was originally assigned to the CA's Sixth Division (composed of Justices Peña, Hernandez, and Amparo), where it was orally argued and submitted for decision [1]. However, Justice Peña died on April 20, 1961 [2]. On April 25, 1961, Palisoc's counsel wrote to the Clerk of Court requesting a new oral argument before the division to which the case would be reassigned [2].

The case was subsequently reassigned to the Fifth Division (Justices Lanting, Angeles, and Victoriano). On May 25, 1963, the Fifth Division rendered a decision affirming Palisoc's conviction without conducting the requested second oral argument [2]. Palisoc filed a motion to set aside the decision, arguing she was deprived of her day in court because the deciding Justices were not present during the original hearing [2, 3]. After her motions were denied, she filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Justices of the Fifth Division could validly render a decision on the case despite not being present during the oral argument.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 1, Rule 53 of the Old Rules of Court, any Justice who is a member of the court at the time of adjudication may participate in the decision, regardless of whether they were present at the date of submission [4, 5].

The Court explained that the only exception is when a party files a written manifestation *at the date of submission* specifically requesting that only the Justices present during oral argument participate in the decision [5]. Palisoc failed to file such a manifestation at the time of submission [5].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the denial of the prayer for a second hearing did not constitute a deprivation of due process [6]. Palisoc had already been afforded the right to argue her case orally through counsel in the first hearing [6]. The Court cited *Domingo v. David* (68 Phil. 134), ruling that a denial of a motion for a second oral argument does not violate due process [6].

The petition for certiorari is **DENIED** [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [7].
