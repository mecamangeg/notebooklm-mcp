I. CAPTION
LUZ M. GIGARE v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-21376, August 29, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On April 19, 1957, customs agents searched the vessel F/S "Bais" docked in Jolo and discovered 519 cartons of "Chesterfield" cigarettes concealed in different parts of the ship. The cigarettes bore "blue seals" indicating US manufacture but lacked the required Philippine internal revenue strip stamps. Petitioner Luz M. Gigare, a transient in Jolo, eventually claimed ownership of the goods, alleging she purchased them in the open market of Jolo. However, she had initially denied ownership when questioned, admitting she feared detention. The Commissioner of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the cigarettes for violation of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC) and the Tax Code. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the forfeiture. Gigare appealed, arguing that she was a mere buyer in good faith and that the foreign character and illegal importation of the goods were not proven.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cigarettes are subject to forfeiture despite the petitioner being a mere buyer in the open market.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the forfeiture, ruling that the cigarettes constituted "merchandise of prohibited importation" under Sections 1363 and 1364 of the Revised Administrative Code because the internal revenue tax had not been paid. The presence of blue seals and the absence of Philippine internal revenue stamps satisfactorily proved that the goods were foreign products imported without passing through a customhouse.

The Court rejected the defense that the petitioner was merely a buyer in the open market. Forfeiture proceedings are instituted against the *res* (the goods themselves), regardless of the possessor's role [1]. Under Section 1364 of the RAC, forfeiture applies even if the merchandise is in the hands of a buyer, provided they have knowledge of the illegal importation. In this case, knowledge was imputed to the petitioner because the goods were concealed on the vessel, and she initially denied ownership due to fear of detention—behavior inconsistent with innocence. To rule otherwise would allow accessories to smugglers to operate with impunity. The petition was denied, and the judgment affirmed.
