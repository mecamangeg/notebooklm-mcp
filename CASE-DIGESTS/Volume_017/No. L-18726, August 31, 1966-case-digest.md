I. CAPTION
THOMAS M. GONZALEZ v. DEMETRIO B. ENCARNACION and VENANCIO H. AQUINO, G.R. No. L-18726, August 31, 1966, 17 SCRA 1028, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On September 6, 1960, plaintiff Thomas M. Gonzalez filed a complaint for damages (libel) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cagayan against Demetrio B. Encarnacion and Venancio H. Aquino. Gonzalez alleged that Encarnacion, a resident of Cavite, filed a "Reply and Answer to Counterclaim" in a separate civil case (Civil Case N-151) pending before the CFI of Cavite which contained libelous and derogatory words against Gonzalez.

Encarnacion moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of improper venue and lack of cause of action, arguing that under Republic Act No. 1289, the claim should have been filed in the CFI of Cavite where Civil Case N-151 was pending to avoid multiplicity of suits, and that the Cavite court had acquired jurisdiction to the exclusion of others. The CFI of Cagayan initially denied the motion but later reversed itself and dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action should have been brought in Cavite. Gonzalez appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the venue for the civil action for libel was properly laid in the CFI of Cagayan, the residence of the plaintiff, despite the alleged libelous statements being published in a pleading filed in the CFI of Cavite.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal order. Under Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1289, civil actions for damages in cases of written defamation "shall" be filed with the Court of First Instance of the province or city in which "any of the accused or any of the offended parties resides."

Applying the doctrine in *Dizon v. Encarnacion* (G.R. No. L-18615, 1963), the Court held that the statute gives the plaintiff the choice of venue: either the court of his residence or that of the accused. The plaintiff is not compelled to file the action where the libel was published (in this case, Cavite) unless he chooses to do so under the specific exception where the libel is published in a place where neither party resides. The provision stating that the court where the action is first filed acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of others refers to the specific libel action itself, not the distinct civil case (Case N-151) in which the libelous pleading was filed. Thus, Gonzalez properly exercised his option to file suit in his province of residence.

The Order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings.
