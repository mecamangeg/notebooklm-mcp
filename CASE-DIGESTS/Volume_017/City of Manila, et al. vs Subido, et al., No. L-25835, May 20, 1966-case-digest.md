I. CAPTION
CITY OF MANILA and MAYOR ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, et al., G.R. No. L-25835, May 20, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
In March 1966, petitioner Mayor Antonio J. Villegas submitted appointments for approximately 500 city employees to respondent Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido for approval. Subido refused to act on the appointments and returned them, asserting that Villegas was no longer the Mayor of Manila. Subido claimed that Villegas had vacated his office and abandoned his post when he assumed the position of Director of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) in June 1965. Villegas had assumed the NAWASA post pursuant to a designation by the President as an "Acting Member" of the Board. Villegas subsequently resigned from NAWASA in early 1966 but continued acting as Mayor. Villegas filed a petition for Mandamus to compel the Commissioner to act on the appointments.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service has the power or jurisdiction to declare the position of Mayor vacant.
2. W/N Mayor Villegas abandoned his office as Mayor by accepting the designation as Acting Director of NAWASA.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Commissioner of Civil Service has no power or jurisdiction to indirectly oust an incumbent official by refusing to approve appointments extended by the latter. The law provides that an official actually performing his duties may only be ousted by *quo warranto* proceedings initiated by the Solicitor General or the party entitled to the office (*Nacionalista Party v. Bautista*; *Nacionalista Party v. De Vera*). The Commissioner’s authority is limited to verifying compliance with Civil Service Law and determining if the *office* itself possesses the prerogative to issue the appointment; he cannot pass upon the tenure or qualification of the person making the appointment (referencing the "de facto officer" principle).

2. **NO.** Petitioner did not abandon his office as Mayor because he was merely *designated* as an *Acting* Member of the NAWASA Board, not appointed to it. A designation to act in a temporary capacity does not constitute abandonment of the original office (*Santiago v. Agustin*, 46 Phil. 14). Consequently, Villegas remained the lawful Mayor of Manila.

Petition is **GRANTED**. The Commissioner of Civil Service is required to act on the appointments.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, and Makalintal concurred. Justices Regala, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez took no part.
