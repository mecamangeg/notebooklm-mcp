I. CAPTION
*Testate Estate of Jose Castillo y Refuerzo; Beatriz M. Vda. de Castillo, et al. v. Blanca Castillo, et al.*, G.R. No. L-20821, August 31, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
After the death of Jose Castillo, his legitimate daughters, Blanca et al. (appellants), sought to probate a 1928 will. The surviving widow, Beatriz, and other children (appellees) opposed this and presented a 1945 will. To settle the dispute, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement on April 15, 1955, withdrawing both wills and stipulating the specific liquidation and distribution of the estate [1, 2]. The probate court approved the agreement and appointed the Philippine National Bank as administrator [3].

Years later, appellees moved for the delivery of properties specifically assigned to them under paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the agreement. Appellants opposed, arguing that the agreement was a bilateral contract requiring simultaneous performance and that partial distribution was improper prior to the final liquidation of the estate [4, 5]. The lower court granted the partial distribution. Appellants appealed, claiming the order was injurious to their rights [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the probate court may validly order the partial distribution of the estate properties based on a compromise agreement prior to the final liquidation of the estate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that where heirs enter into a compromise agreement approved by the probate court, partial distribution may be ordered without waiting for final liquidation if no prejudice is shown [7, 8]. The Court noted that the appellants were already in possession of the properties assigned to them under paragraph 7 of the agreement; thus, the partial distribution to the appellees merely tended to minimize the disparity between the groups [9].

However, the Court ruled that the fruits of the properties distributed must share in the burden of administration expenses until final liquidation. Therefore, the distributees must post a bond to guarantee payment of their share in these expenses [10]. To ensure full parity, the Court also ordered the distribution of the properties listed in paragraph 6 to the appellants [9].

The order is **MODIFIED** to require the bond and include the distribution of paragraph 6 properties; affirmed in all other respects [11, 12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred. Justice J.B.L. Reyes did not take part. Justice Regala was on leave [11, 12].
