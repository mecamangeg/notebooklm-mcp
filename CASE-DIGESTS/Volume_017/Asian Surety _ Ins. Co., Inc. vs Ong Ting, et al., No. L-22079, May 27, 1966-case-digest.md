I. CAPTION
ASIAN SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. ONG TING, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22079, May 27, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Asian Surety & Insurance Company, Inc. filed an action for collection of sums of money against Ong Ting and Ricardo Relucio. Summons were served on both defendants, but neither filed an answer. Consequently, the trial court declared them in default and rendered judgment on March 6, 1963, holding them jointly and severally liable for the amounts claimed.

Relucio subsequently filed a motion to lift the order of default and set aside the judgment, alleging "accident, mistake and/or excusable negligence." In support, his wife, Avelina Manapat, executed an affidavit stating that she received the summons on September 24, 1962, while Relucio was in the province. However, she delivered the summons to co-defendant Ong Ting, who assured her he would settle the case amicably. Relying on this, she forgot to inform her husband about the suit until a writ of execution was served on their business. The trial court denied the motion for lack of merit.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure of the defendant's wife to inform him of the summons constitutes excusable negligence sufficient to lift the order of default.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the negligence was not excusable. The record showed that the defendant's wife was a literate business owner who understood the import of the summons [1]. Instead of entrusting the matter to a co-defendant, she should have immediately communicated with her husband, who was in the province, via wire or letter [1]. There was no showing that the defendant could not have been reached in time to file an answer or ask for an extension [1].

Citing *Manzanillo v. Jaramilla* (84 Phil. 809), the Court reiterated that in motions to lift an order of default, the moving party bears the burden of affirmatively showing diligence [2]. The defendant failed to discharge this burden. Consequently, the Court affirmed the order denying the motion.
