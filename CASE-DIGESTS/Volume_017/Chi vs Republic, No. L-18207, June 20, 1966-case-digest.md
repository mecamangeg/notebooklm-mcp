I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JOVENCIO CHI TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES: JOVENCIO CHI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-18207, June 20, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 23, 1959, Jovencio Chi filed a petition for naturalization. In his petition, he stated his present residence at 1028-G Benavides, Manila, and a former residence in Tabaco, Albay. However, during his testimony, he admitted that he resided at 1078 Padre Algue, Manila, from 1952 to 1955. This former residence was not included in his petition. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition. The Republic appealed, contending that the failure to state all former places of residence was a fatal defect. Chi argued that the omission was not fatal because the authorities could have investigated his activities at the omitted address, claiming it was noted in his Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR).

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's failure to state all former places of residence in the petition for naturalization is a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The failure to specify *all* former places of residence in the petition for naturalization—even those situated within the same city—is a fatal defect that cannot be cured by supplying the data during the trial [1].

Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law requires former places of residence to be stated to ensure that, upon publication, the authorities and the public are accorded the opportunity to investigate the applicant's conduct in those places [2, 3]. The Court held that this purpose is not satisfied by what appears in the Alien Certificate of Registration (ACR) [2]. Furthermore, the Court found that Chi's ACR did not actually mention the omitted address [4].

The Court distinguished this case from *Peregrina Tan v. Republic*, where the omission concerned a residence during war-time evacuation when the applicant was only 14 years old. In contrast, Chi failed to report a residence where he lived for three years while he was between 24 and 27 years of age [5].

The judgment of the lower court is **REVERSED** [6].
