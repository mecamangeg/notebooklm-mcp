I. CAPTION
RENATO D. TAYAG, ET AL. v. THE ANGELES ELECTRIC CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-22549, May 19, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 18, 1951, Renato D. Tayag and others filed a complaint against Angeles Electric Corporation for the abatement of a nuisance allegedly caused by the latter’s electric light and power plant [1]. Years later, on February 15, 1963, the plaintiffs filed a motion for the admission of an amended complaint, which sought to drop some original plaintiffs and include four new persons as defendants [2].

The defendant corporation opposed the admission of the amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to secure prior court permission in violation of the Rules of Court, and that the amendment added new causes of action and parties without the defendant's consent [2]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga admitted the amended complaint on November 14, 1963, and denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration [2, 3]. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in admitting the amended complaint on the ground that plaintiffs failed to obtain prior leave of court.
2. W/N the consent of the original defendant is required to drop or add parties in an amended complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the claim of lack of permission was without merit because the trial court had expressly granted the plaintiffs 30 days to file said amended complaint pursuant to a request they had previously made [4]. The permission granted by the court specifically stated that all parties concerned be notified of the order, confirming that leave of court was properly secured [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the dropping or adding of parties does not require the previous consent of any party [5]. Citing Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, the Court emphasized that "Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just" [5]. The amendment was allowed at an early stage of the proceedings where the defendant could still file pleadings to protect its interest; instead, the defendant attempted to thwart the amendment on mere technical grounds [5]. Regarding the argument that the new defendants were merely stockholders with no interest in the case, the Court noted this was a matter of defense that did not defeat the plaintiffs' right to amend [6].

The order appealed from is affirmed [7].
