I. CAPTION
GREGORIO VILLARTA, GLICERIO VILLARTA and MARINA VILLARTA v. FAUSTA CUTAMORA VDA. DE CUYNO, et al., G.R. No. L-20682, May 19, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property originally belonged to Isidoro Cuyno, who died prior to 1936 [1]. For failure to pay real estate taxes, the 14.84-hectare portion of the land was forfeited to the Government in 1936 [2]. To avoid its sale at public auction, Marciano Cuyno (Isidoro’s son) asked petitioner Gregorio Villarta, whose wife is Isidoro's granddaughter, to pay the delinquent taxes [2]. Gregorio paid the taxes from 1936 to 1937, but the receipts were issued in the name of the deceased Isidoro Cuyno [2, 3].

In 1946, Gregorio declared the land in his name under Tax Declaration No. 13462 [4]. In 1961, Gregorio and his children filed an action for ownership and possession against the heirs of Marciano Cuyno, claiming they were forcibly deprived of possession in 1953 [4]. The Court of First Instance of Bohol declared Gregorio owner of a small portion but dismissed the case regarding the 14.84-hectare lot because the other heirs of Isidoro Cuyno were not impleaded as parties [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Gregorio Villarta acquired ownership of the land by paying the delinquent taxes to the government.
2. W/N petitioners acquired ownership through acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that paying delinquent taxes does not transfer ownership to the payor. Since the delinquent taxpayer was the estate of Isidoro Cuyno, Gregorio’s payment merely subrogated him into the rights of the Government as a *creditor* for the delinquent taxes under Article 1236 of the Civil Code [3, 7]. The fact that Gregorio accepted receipts in Isidoro's name proves he made payments for the benefit of the deceased owner, effectively becoming a trustee for Isidoro’s heirs [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that petitioners' possession was insufficient for prescription. First, as a trustee paying taxes for Isidoro, Gregorio’s possession is deemed held in trust and not adverse until clearly repudiated [8]. Second, even assuming adverse possession began when he declared the land in his name in 1946, the ten-year prescriptive period was interrupted by the filing of Civil Case No. 292 by the defendants in 1948 and the dispossession in 1953 [4, 8]. Furthermore, the Court affirmed the dismissal regarding the larger parcel because the determination of shares requires the joinder of all co-heirs of Isidoro Cuyno, who were not made parties to the case [9, 10].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [10].
