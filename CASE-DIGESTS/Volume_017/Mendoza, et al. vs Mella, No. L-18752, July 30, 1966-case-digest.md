I. CAPTION
CATALINA MENDOZA and RODOLFO PAREJA v. TEMISTOCLES C. MELLA, G.R. No. L-18752, July 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The subject property (Lot No. 3390-B, Sorsogon cadastre) was originally owned by Paciano Pareja, who donated it to his son Gavino Pareja in 1939 [1]. Gavino lived there with his common-law wife, petitioner Catalina Mendoza, and their son, petitioner Rodolfo Pareja [1]. Gavino disappeared in 1943 and was presumed killed by guerillas that same year [1, 2]. In 1948, Paciano sold the lot to respondent Temistocles Mella [3]. Petitioners remained in possession until Mella demanded they vacate in 1952; Mella subsequently filed a complaint for recovery of possession in 1955 [3]. Petitioners claimed ownership through Rodolfo's succession from Gavino and by adverse possession [3]. The Court of First Instance and Court of Appeals (CA) ruled in favor of Mella [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing for the first time that under Article 390 of the Civil Code, Gavino should be presumed dead only after 10 years (i.e., 1953), making the 1948 sale by Paciano valid only if Gavino was still alive, or void if Rodolfo inherited [2, 4]. They also argued Rodolfo was an acknowledged natural child based on his birth certificate [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners can raise the application of Article 390 (presumption of death) for the first time on appeal.
2. W/N Rodolfo Pareja is an acknowledged natural child entitled to succession based on his birth certificate.
3. W/N petitioners acquired the property through acquisitive prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The issue regarding the applicability of Article 390 was not raised in the trial court or the Court of Appeals [6]. Records showed the parties had previously agreed and admitted that Gavino died in 1943 [2, 6]. Issues not raised in the lower courts cannot be raised for the first time on appeal [6].

2. **NO.** Rodolfo was born in 1935, after the enactment of the Registry Law (Act No. 3753) [7]. Under Section 5 of Act No. 3753, for a birth certificate to serve as proof of acknowledgment, the parents must sign and swear to its contents [7]. Rodolfo’s birth certificate did not show that his parents signed it [7]. Furthermore, under Article 131 of the Old Civil Code, a public document must contain a clear statement of recognition to effect voluntary acknowledgment, which was absent in this case [8]. Thus, Rodolfo was not proven to be an acknowledged natural child [8].

3. **NO.** The Court of Appeals found that the petitioners' possession of the property was merely by tolerance of Paciano Pareja, and therefore was not adverse prior to the sale in 1948 [8]. From the 1948 sale until the filing of the complaint in 1955, only seven years had elapsed, which is insufficient for acquisitive prescription [8].

The petition is denied and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [9].
