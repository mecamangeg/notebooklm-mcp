I. CAPTION
PEDRO ARCE v. THE CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-28501, September 30, 1966.

II. FACTS
Pedro Arce (plaintiff-appellee) brought an action against The Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (defendant-appellant) seeking to recover proceeds under an insurance policy. The insurance company refused to pay, contending that the insured failed to pay the premiums on the policy [1]. The available sources do not detail the lower court's specific findings, but the insurer appealed the case to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the insurance contract is effective and the insurer is liable to pay proceeds when the insured has failed to pay the premiums.

IV. RULING
**NO** (qualified). The Court held that unless the premium is paid, the insurance contract is not effective. The insurance company is relieved of the obligation to pay insurance proceeds under the policy for the insured's failure to pay premiums on the policy [1]. The Court noted that under the Insurance Act and the stipulation of the parties, time is of the essence regarding premium payments [2]. (Note: While the legal doctrine cited favors the insurer, the source metadata indicates the disposition as "Judgment affirmed," [1] which typically implies the lower court's decision was upheld).
