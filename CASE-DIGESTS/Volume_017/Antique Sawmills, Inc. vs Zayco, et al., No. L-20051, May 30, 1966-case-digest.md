I. CAPTION
ANTIQUE SAWMILLS, INC. v. AQUILES R. ZAYCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20051, May 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1954, the Bureau of Forestry conducted a public bidding for a 12,680-hectare forest area. The Director of Forestry awarded the bid to respondent Aquiles Zayco [1]. Petitioner Antique Sawmills, Inc. and other losing bidders appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR). Initially affirming the award to Zayco, the Secretary later modified the decision on July 14, 1955, upon a motion for reconsideration, awarding the area in equal portions to Zayco and Antique Sawmills [2].

Zayco filed a motion for reconsideration on August 20, 1955, which was denied. He filed a second motion for reconsideration on December 19, 1955 [2, 3]. The Secretary of Agriculture denied the second motion on February 15, 1956, ruling that it was filed out of time, as fifty (50) days had elapsed since Zayco received the order—well beyond the 30-day reglementary period prescribed by Forestry Administrative Order No. 6-2 [3]. Consequently, the Secretary declared the July 14, 1955 order final and executory [3].

Despite this, Zayco appealed to the Office of the President. On August 27, 1956, the Executive Secretary reversed the DANR decision and awarded the entire concession to Zayco, reasoning that technical rules could be relaxed in the interest of justice [4, 5]. Antique Sawmills filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance of Manila, which dismissed the petition [6]. Antique Sawmills appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Office of the President has jurisdiction to review an administrative decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources that has already become final and executory.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that compliance with the period provided by law for the perfection of an appeal is not merely mandatory but also a jurisdictional requirement [7]. 

The Court emphasized that administrative rules and regulations, such as Forestry Administrative Order No. 6-2, have the force of law [8]. Zayco's failure to perfect his appeal within the 30-day reglementary period rendered the DANR decision final, and jurisdiction was lost [9]. The Court rejected the argument that the period was a mere technicality that the Office of the President could ignore. Citing the rule of *non quieta movere*, the Court held that public policy demands finality in administrative proceedings just as in judicial controversies; proceedings already terminated should not be altered [10].

The decision of the Court of First Instance was reversed, and the order of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources dated July 14, 1955, was declared valid, effective, and subsisting [11].
