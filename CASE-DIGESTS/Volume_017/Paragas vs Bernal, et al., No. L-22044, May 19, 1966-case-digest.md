I. CAPTION
ZOILO PARAGAS v. HON. ESTANISLAO R. BERNAL, et al., G.R. No. L-22044, May 19, 1966, 17 SCRA 150, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Zoilo Paragas was appointed *ad interim* Chief of Police of Dagupan City by President Garcia on November 6, 1961, and was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on May 3, 1962. On September 11, 1962, respondent Assistant Executive Secretary Bernal directed Paragas to desist from performing his duties. Paragas filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus to prevent his ouster and compel payment of his salary. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition, ruling that while Paragas’ appointment was valid, under the Dagupan City Charter (R.A. No. 170), the Chief of Police holds office "at the pleasure of the President." Paragas appealed, arguing that the "at pleasure" provision was repealed by R.A. No. 2259 and the Civil Service Act (R.A. No. 2260), which prohibit removal except for cause, citing *Libarnes v. Executive Secretary*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's services as Chief of Police were validly terminated by the President without cause.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the petitioner's services were validly terminated because his term had expired. Under Section 19 of the Dagupan City Charter (R.A. No. 170), the Chief of Police "holds office at the pleasure of the President." Consequently, the term of office expires at any time the President may so declare.

The Court distinguished this case from *Libarnes v. Executive Secretary*. In *Libarnes*, the charter authorized the President to "remove at pleasure," which constitutes a removal prohibited by R.A. No. 2259 without cause. In contrast, holding office "at the pleasure of the President" involves the expiration of term, not removal. Removal entails the ouster of an incumbent before the expiration of his term (*Manalang v. Quitoriano*), whereas in this case, the tenure simply ends upon the President's declaration (*Alba v. Alajar*). Thus, petitioner's term expired upon receipt of the directive to desist.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
