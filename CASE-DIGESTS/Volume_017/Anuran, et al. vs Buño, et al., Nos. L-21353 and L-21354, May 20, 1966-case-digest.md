I. CAPTION
GREGORIO ANURAN, et al. v. PEPITO BUÑO, et al., G.R. Nos. L-21353 and L-21354, May 20, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 12, 1958, a passenger jeepney owned by spouses Pedro Gahol and Luisa Alcantara, and driven by Pepito Buño, was parked on the road to Taal, Batangas. The jeepney was parked improperly with its left wheels on the asphalt pavement and was overloaded with passengers. A speeding motor truck negligently bumped the jeepney from behind, causing it to turn turtle. As a result, three passengers died and two others were injured [1-3].

The victims' representatives filed suits for damages against the drivers and owners of both vehicles. The Court of First Instance of Batangas absolved the jeepney driver and owners, holding only the truck driver and owners liable. The Court of Appeals affirmed this exoneration, reasoning that although the jeepney driver was negligent in parking improperly, the truck driver had the "last clear chance" to avoid the collision and was the efficient cause of the accident [2-4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting that the jeepney driver and owners should also be held liable [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the doctrine of "last clear chance" exempts the common carrier (jeepney driver and owners) from liability to its passengers.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the principle of "last clear chance" applies only in a suit between the owners and drivers of two colliding vehicles. It does not apply where a passenger demands responsibility from the carrier to enforce its contractual obligations [6-8].

Under the New Civil Code, common carriers are obligated to transport passengers safely with "utmost" diligence (Art. 1755) and are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted negligently unless they prove they observed extraordinary diligence (Art. 1756) [9, 10]. Since the jeepney driver was admittedly negligent by parking improperly on the pavement, he and the owners must answer for the injuries to their passengers. It would be inequitable to exempt the negligent carrier on the ground that the other driver was also negligent [7-9].

Accordingly, the Supreme Court **GRANTED** the modification requested. The driver and owners of the jeepney were declared solidarily liable with the driver and owners of the truck for the damages awarded [5, 6].
