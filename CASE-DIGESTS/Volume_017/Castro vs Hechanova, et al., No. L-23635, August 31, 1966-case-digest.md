I. CAPTION
TEODORO M. CASTRO v. RUFINO G. HECHANOVA, et al., G.R. No. L-23635, August 31, 1966, 17 SCRA 1023, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teodoro M. Castro, the Internal Revenue Regional Director for Southern Luzon (San Pablo City), was relieved of his duties and directed to report to the central office as "Revenue Operations Head, Inspection Department" pursuant to Travel Assignment Order No. 100-64 issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on August 14, 1964 [1, 2]. Castro sought reconsideration, arguing that his transfer from "field" to "desk" work without a corresponding appointment amounted to a removal without just cause [3]. The respondents denied his request, maintaining that the assignment was temporary, authorized under Section 12 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code), and actually constituted a promotion in rank based on WAPCO ratings [4]. Castro filed a petition for prohibition, mandamus, and *quo warranto* before the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the temporary assignment of the petitioner to a position other than that to which he was appointed constitutes a removal without cause in violation of his security of tenure.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the assignment was valid, provided it complies with administrative limitations on duration. Under Section 12 of the Tax Code, the Commissioner may assign employees to "special duties" without a change in official character or salary if the exigencies of the service require it [5]. The Court defined "special duties" not as extraordinary tasks requiring special talent, but simply as functions different from those regularly discharged by the employee [6]. Consequently, such assignments are temporary and do not violate the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure [6, 7].

However, the Court held that while the transfer was lawful, it must conform to Administrative Order No. 42, series of 1937, which limits special assignments to thirty (30) days unless approved by the President [8, 9]. Although the disputed Travel Order did not specify a duration, it is deemed subject to this limitation [10].

The petition was dismissed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. (Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred) [11].
