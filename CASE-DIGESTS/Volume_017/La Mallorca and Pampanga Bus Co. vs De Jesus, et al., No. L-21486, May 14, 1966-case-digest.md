I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA and PAMPANGA BUS COMPANY v. VALENTIN DE JESUS, MANOLO TOLENTINO and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21486, May 14, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On the morning of October 8, 1959, in Marilao, Bulacan, a head-on collision occurred between a bus owned by petitioner La Mallorca and Pampanga Bus Company (La Mallorca) and a freight truck traveling in the opposite direction [1]. The accident resulted in the death of Lolita de Jesus, a 20-year-old passenger, who was the daughter of respondent Valentin de Jesus and wife of respondent Manolo Tolentino [1]. The immediate cause of the collision was a sudden blowout of the bus's left front tire, causing the driver to lose control [1].

Evidence revealed that the inner tube of the tire was pressed between the inner circle of the left wheel and the rim, which had slipped out [2]. The bus was also found to be running fast, and the tire was not new [3]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan held La Mallorca liable for actual, compensatory, and moral damages, as well as counsel fees [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [4]. La Mallorca appealed, arguing that a tire blowout is a *caso fortuito* (fortuitous event) that should exempt them from negligence liability [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tire blowout constitutes a *caso fortuito* exempting the common carrier from liability.
2. W/N the common carrier is liable for moral damages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The tire blowout was not a fortuitous event. The Court held that the cause of the blowout—the inner tube being pressed between the wheel's inner circle and the rim—was a mechanical defect or fault in equipment [2]. This defect would have been easily discoverable had the bus been subjected to a thorough or rigid check-up before the trip [2]. Furthermore, the bus was running fast and the tire was not new [3]. A mechanical defect that is discoverable through regular maintenance does not constitute *force majeure* [5].

2. **YES.** Under Philippine jurisdiction, moral damages are recoverable for the death of a passenger caused by a common carrier's breach of contract [3]. The Court applied Article 1764, in relation to Article 2206, of the Civil Code, citing established jurisprudence such as *Necesito v. Paras* and *Villa-Rey Transit v. Bello* [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED, with costs against petitioners [5].
