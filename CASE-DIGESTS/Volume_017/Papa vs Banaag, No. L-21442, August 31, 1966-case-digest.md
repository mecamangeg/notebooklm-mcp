I. CAPTION
SALUD S. PAPA v. GERVACIO S. BANAAG, G.R. No. L-21442, August 31, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 9, 1960, Respondent Banaag obtained a P400.00 loan from Petitioner Papa, secured by a chattel mortgage on a piano. Upon Banaag's default, Papa attempted to foreclose the mortgage extrajudicially. To prevent this, Banaag filed Civil Case No. Q-6004, alleging Papa granted him an indefinite extension. Papa prevailed, and the case was dismissed [1, 2]. However, the extrajudicial foreclosure could not proceed because Banaag refused to surrender the piano [3]. Papa then filed the present action (Civil Case No. 52464) to collect the debt and claim damages [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Papa’s claim was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been set up in the previous Civil Case No. Q-6004 and was now barred by *res judicata* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to collect the principal debt is barred by the rule on compulsory counterclaims.
2. W/N the claims for damages arising from the previous litigation are barred.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action to collect the debt is not barred. While the claim strictly partakes of the nature of a compulsory counterclaim under the Rules of Court, the Chattel Mortgage Law grants a substantive right to extrajudicial foreclosure which the Rules cannot repeal or abrogate [6, 7]. Banaag defeated the extrajudicial remedy by refusing to surrender the chattel [3]. The Court likened the situation to an alternative obligation under **Article 1205 of the Civil Code**: since the debtor rendered the option of foreclosure impossible, the creditor may claim the subsisting alternative of judicial collection [3].

2. **YES.** The claims for actual, moral, and exemplary damages resulting from the filing of the previous suit (Civil Case No. Q-6004) are barred. These claims were necessarily connected with the previous litigation and constituted compulsory counterclaims that should have been raised in that case pursuant to **Section 4, Rule 9 of the Revised Rules of Court** [8].

The decision is **AFFIRMED** as to the damages but **SET ASIDE** regarding the collection of the debt, and the case is **REMANDED** for further proceedings [9].
