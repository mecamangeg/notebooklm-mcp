I. CAPTION
ONG SIU, ET AL. v. HON. ANTONIO P. PAREDES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21638, July 26, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ong Siu, et al. were charged with slight physical injuries and light threats in the Municipal Court of Manila. These cases were jointly tried with the counter-charges of serious and slight physical injuries filed against respondents Charlie Fung and Benjamin Lu. Judge Sta. Maria heard the cases and signed a decision on July 7, 1962. However, on July 9, 1962, before the decision could be promulgated, Judge Sta. Maria assumed the position of CFI Judge of Mindoro.

Subsequently, respondent Judge Paredes, the new Municipal Judge, scheduled the promulgation of Judge Sta. Maria’s decision. The decision was read to the petitioners, purportedly acquitting them. However, upon a petition by respondents Fung and Lu, the CFI declared the decision void because Judge Sta. Maria was no longer a judge of the Municipal Court at the time of promulgation. Consequently, Judge Paredes ordered a retrial. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to restrain the retrial, arguing that since the decision acquitting them had been promulgated, a retrial would subject them to double jeopardy. The CFI dismissed their petition, ruling that the prior judgment was void.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the promulgation of a decision signed by a judge who had ceased to hold office at the time of promulgation is valid.
2. W/N the scheduled retrial constitutes double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Section 6 of Rule 116 (now Rule 120) of the Rules of Court, which allows a decision to be read by the clerk of court when the judge is "absent or outside of the province or city," refers only to physical absence, not to the cessation of or removal from office. A decision may be promulgated in the judge's absence only if he is still a judge of that court (*Lino Luna v. Rodriguez*). It is well-settled that to be binding, a judgment must be duly signed and promulgated during the incumbency of the judge who signed it. Since Judge Sta. Maria had already vacated his post as Municipal Judge to become a CFI Judge when the decision was promulgated, there was no judgment validly entered (*People v. So*).

2. **NO.** For the defense of double jeopardy to lie, there must be a valid judgment acquitting or convicting the accused or terminating the case without their consent (Section 9, Rule 117). Since the decision penned by Judge Sta. Maria was void for lack of valid promulgation, there was no valid acquittal or conviction. The retrial does not place the accused in double jeopardy but is merely a continuation of the trial, similar to the reconstitution of lost evidence (*People v. Dagatan*).

Petition denied. Decision of the CFI affirmed.
