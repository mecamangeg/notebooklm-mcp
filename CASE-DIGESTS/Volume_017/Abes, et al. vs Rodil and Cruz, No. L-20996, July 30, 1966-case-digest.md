I. CAPTION
ALEJO ABES, ET AL. v. TOMAS RODIL and CATALINA CRUZ, G.R. No. L-20996, July 30, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the Peñaranda cadastral proceedings (Cadastral Case No. 61), spouses Tomas Rodil and Catalina Cruz claimed ownership of certain lots [1]. Alejandro Abes, the ancestor of the petitioners (Alejo Abes, et al.), also claimed the same lots [1]. On October 11, 1958, the cadastral court adjudicated the lots to the Rodil spouses, and a Torrens title was issued to them on December 10, 1958 [1].

On February 26, 1959, the heirs of Alejandro Abes filed a petition for review of the registration decree, alleging that the award was secured through fraud [2]. The cadastral court heard the case, receiving oral and documentary evidence from the heirs [2]. On July 7, 1961, the court denied the petition, ruling that the heirs failed to overcome the evidence of the Rodil spouses [2]. The heirs did not appeal this order [3].

Instead, on September 4, 1961, the heirs filed a civil suit (Civil Case No. 3728) against the Rodils for reconveyance of the titled properties and damages, again alleging fraud, misrepresentation, and the use of falsified deeds [3]. The Rodils moved to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata* [3]. The lower court dismissed the complaint [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reconveyance is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that all the requisites of *res judicata* were present: (a) the order denying the petition for review in the cadastral case was final; (b) the cadastral court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties; (c) the original judgment was on the merits; and (d) there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action between the cadastral case and the present civil case [4].

The Court applied the test: "Would the same evidence support and establish both the present and former cause of action?" [5]. It answered in the affirmative, noting that the evidence in both proceedings was directed at the question of ownership [5]. The Court rejected the petitioners' argument that the petition for review was merely a preliminary step, noting that they were given full opportunity to present evidence on ownership during the hearing on the petition for review [6]. Although the first case was a cadastral proceeding (*in rem*) and the second was for reconveyance, the underlying issue litigated in both was ownership [7]. Where fraud is alleged in the first case and the same fraud is relied upon in the second, the former judgment operates as *res judicata* (citing *San Diego v. Cardona*, 70 Phil. 281) [5, 8].

The orders appealed from are affirmed.
