I. CAPTION
OSCAR N. JACOB v. THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, G.R. No. L-20798, June 21, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Oscar N. Jacob, an employee of the Bureau of Lands in Camarines Norte, faced administrative charges for allegedly submitting false investigation reports that led to the erroneous issuance of free patents to Angel Ables and Cleto Asprec. The administrative complaint against him was signed by the Assistant Director of Lands but was not under oath. Jacob filed a petition for declaratory relief and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Camarines Norte to stop the investigation. He argued that under Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959), no complaint against a civil service employee should be given due course unless it is in writing and sworn to by the complainant. The CFI ruled in Jacob's favor, prohibiting the investigation because the complaint was unsworn. The Director of Lands appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an administrative complaint filed by the head of an office against a subordinate must be subscribed under oath.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that under Executive Order No. 370, series of 1941, administrative proceedings may be commenced by the head or chief of a bureau *motu proprio*. In such cases, the written charge need not be sworn to because the head of office is deemed to be acting in his official capacity and under his oath of office [1]. The Court explained that the requirement in Section 32 of R.A. 2260 for a sworn complaint applies only when the charge is filed by a private person, a provision intended to protect government employees from malicious complaints filed for harassment [1]. Citing *Maloga v. Gella* and *Esperanza v. Castillo*, the Court reiterated that it would be illogical to require the head of the bureau to swear to a complaint he filed himself in the performance of his duties [1, 2].

The decision appealed from was **REVERSED**, and the Director of Lands was allowed to proceed with the investigation [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [3].
