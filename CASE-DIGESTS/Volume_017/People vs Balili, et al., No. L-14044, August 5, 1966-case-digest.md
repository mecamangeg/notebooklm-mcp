**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENEDICTO BALILI, et al., G.R. No. L-14044, August 5, 1966, Makalintal, J.**

**II. FACTS**
On September 10, 1956, in Tandag, Surigao, Federico So was found dead with multiple wounds in his store, and P1,000.00 was missing. There were no eyewitnesses to the actual killing. The prosecution relied on the testimony of a policeman who saw appellant Benedicto Balili lurking near the victim's house at the time of the crime, and Balili’s own extrajudicial confession (Exhibit C) where he admitted accompanying the perpetrators ("Moros" and "Big Boy") but claimed he was forced to do so under threat of death. Balili later retracted Exhibit C, alleging he signed it under duress, presenting a subsequent affidavit (Exhibit 6) allegedly signed after maltreatment. The Court of First Instance of Surigao found Balili guilty as a principal of robbery with homicide and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. He appealed, arguing his confession was involuntary and that he did not conspire with the group [1-5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the appellant's extrajudicial confession (Exhibit C) was voluntary and admissible.
2. W/N the appellant is criminally liable as a principal for robbery with homicide.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the confession was voluntary. Although it is possible that the appellant's *subsequent* affidavit (Exhibit 6) was signed under duress, this possibility does not justify a similar inference regarding the first confession (Exhibit C). The Justice of the Peace affirmed the affidavit was voluntary. Furthermore, the Court held that even if an extrajudicial confession contains exculpatory statements (like the claim he was threatened with a dagger), the Court is not required to believe the confession in its entirety (*People v. Villanueva*). The Court found the claim of coercion to be an afterthought [4, 6, 7].

2. **NO.** The appellant is liable only as an **accomplice**. There was no evidence that the appellant conspired with the malefactors or actually participated in the commission of the robbery and killing. However, by accompanying them knowing their criminal intention, and staying outside the house while the others committed the crime, he effectively supplied the criminals with material and moral aid.

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. Appellant is found guilty as an **ACCOMPLICE** in the crime of robbery with homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* [8-10].
