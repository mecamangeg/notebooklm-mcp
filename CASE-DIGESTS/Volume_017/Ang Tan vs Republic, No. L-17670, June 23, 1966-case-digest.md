I. CAPTION
CHING CHONG ANG TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17670, June 23, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ching Chong Ang Tan, a citizen of Nationalist China, filed a petition for naturalization in 1959 [1]. He was married to a Filipino citizen and had two minor children [1]. He claimed to be employed as the Assistant Manager of the New Philippine Lumber Company with an average annual income of approximately P6,000.00 [1]. During the trial, a character witness died and was substituted, which the Republic opposed due to lack of new publication [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas granted the petition [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the petitioner was not engaged in a lucrative occupation [4]. Evidence revealed that his actual fixed salary was only P150.00 per month (P1,800.00 per annum), while the rest of the alleged income consisted of profits earned as a partner in the company [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative occupation to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the petitioner cannot be considered as being engaged in a lucrative occupation [4]. His fixed salary amounted to a mere P150.00 per month, or P1,800.00 per annum [4]. The Court reasoned that the remaining portion of his income, derived from alleged profits as a partner, was "purely of a contingent character" and thus does not satisfy the statutory requirement for a lucrative trade or profession [4].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [5].
