I. CAPTION
BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC. and HON. JOSE F. FERNANDEZ v. CAPITOL SUBDIVISION, INC. and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-25887, July 26, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co. (Central) operated a railway for transporting sugar cane over "Hacienda Mandalagan," owned by Respondent Capitol Subdivision, Inc., pursuant to a milling contract granting a right of way. The contract expired on September 30, 1965. Upon expiration, the Subdivision demanded the removal of the tracks and threatened to close the passage. On October 10, 1965, the Central filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental to establish a compulsory legal easement and prayed for a preliminary injunction, which the CFI granted on October 13, 1965. The Subdivision questioned this order via certiorari before the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA issued a resolution enjoining the enforcement of the CFI's preliminary injunction, reasoning that the Central's contractual right had already expired and its right to a legal easement was not yet proven. The Central filed the present petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court to annul the CA's resolution.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI properly issued the preliminary injunction to enforce the Central's right of way after the expiration of the contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals. The Court held that the Central's contractual right to the easement expired on September 30, 1965 [1]. Thereafter, its claim relied strictly on a compulsory easement under the Civil Code, which requires the concurrence of four requisites under Articles 649 and 650: (1) the estate is surrounded by other immovables without adequate outlet to a public highway; (2) payment of proper indemnity; (3) the isolation is not due to the proprietor's own acts; and (4) the right of way is at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate [2].

The Central failed to prove these preconditions, specifically the prepayment of indemnity, rendering the injunction improvident [3]. An injunction cannot issue to protect a right *not in esse* or a contingent right; it requires a clear legal right [4, 5]. Furthermore, the function of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the *status quo* at the time of issuance [6]. Since the contract had already expired when the writ was issued, the court could not extend the contract term via injunction [6]. Finally, the Court ruled that the Central was guilty of laches for failing to take seasonable steps to secure the right of way despite knowing the contract would expire [7].

Petition dismissed; the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is lifted, and the injunction of the Court of Appeals is restored.
