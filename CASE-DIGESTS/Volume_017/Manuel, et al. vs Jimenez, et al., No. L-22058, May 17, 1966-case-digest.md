I. CAPTION
EMILIANO D. MANUEL, ET AL. v. PEDRO JIMENEZ, TIMOTEO ABDON and PEDRO RAVAL, G.R. No. L-22058, May 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, the Vice-Mayor and Councilors of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, collected *per diems* for 48 special sessions held in 1960 and 1961 at P18.00 per session [1]. The Provincial Auditor, citing Memorandum No. 250 of the General Auditing Office and Section 2220 of the Administrative Code, ruled that they were only entitled to 24 special sessions per annum [2]. Consequently, he directed the Municipal Treasurer to withhold their future compensation to cover the alleged overpayments [2].

Petitioners filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte to declare their entitlement to 48 sessions under Section 2187 of the Administrative Code (as amended by R.A. 2368) and sought an injunction [2]. Respondents moved to dismiss due to petitioners' failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but the trial court denied the motion and eventually ruled in favor of the petitioners, making the injunction permanent [2]. Respondents appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Section 653 of the Administrative Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act 327, any person aggrieved by the decision of a provincial auditor has the remedy of appealing to the Auditor General, and thereafter to the President [3].

The Court applied the principle that where the law provides remedies against the actions of an administrative officer, relief from the courts can be sought only after exhausting all provided remedies [4]. This rule is peculiarly binding on petitioners because they claimed compensation in their official capacity; reasons of comity and orderly procedure demand resort to the President as the head of the administrative system before recourse to the courts [4]. The fact that the Auditor General had previously ruled against similar claims in other municipalities did not excuse petitioners from following the prescribed administrative procedure [5].

The decision appealed from is reversed, the petition is dismissed, and the injunction is dissolved [5].
