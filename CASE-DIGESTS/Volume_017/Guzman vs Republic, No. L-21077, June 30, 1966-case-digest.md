I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. ADELAIDO DE GUZMAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21077, June 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Adelaido de Guzman, a single citizen of Nationalist China, applied for Philippine citizenship. He testified that he was employed as a cashier at the Snow White Ice Cream Factory in Tondo, Manila, earning a salary of P200.00 per month plus free board and lodging [1]. He also claimed to earn an additional P160.00 per month as a private tutor for his employer’s four children [1]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga granted his petition on July 30, 1962 [2]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing that the petitioner did not possess a lucrative trade or profession as required by law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfies the requirement of having a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found the Solicitor General's contention meritorious. The Court held that a monthly income of P200.00, even with free board and lodging, is not considered lucrative for a single applicant due to the "high cost of living and the prevailing low value of the peso" [3]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Sia v. Republic* and *Tan v. Republic* to support this conclusion [3]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the petitioner's additional income as a private tutor could not be considered in determining gainful employment because it is "unsteady, contingent and irregular," citing *Dy v. Republic* [4].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is reversed and the petition for naturalization is dismissed [4].
