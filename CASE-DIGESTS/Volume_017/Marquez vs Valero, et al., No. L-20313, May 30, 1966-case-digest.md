I. CAPTION
LAURO G. MARQUEZ v. HON. GABRIEL V. VALERO as Judge, Court of First Instance of Sulu and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20313, May 30, 1966, Regala, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lauro G. Marquez was the accused in Criminal Case No. 2639 for the killing of Meinhart Spielman before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Sulu [2]. During the trial on September 6, 1962, the defense counsel moved to postpone the hearing to take depositions of witnesses residing more than 50 kilometers away, arguing that the court’s coercive powers were limited under Section 9, Rule 29 of the Rules of Court [2]. Respondent Judge Valero denied the verbal motion and a subsequent written urgent motion, ruling that they did not comply with the requirements for the examination of witnesses for the defendant before trial under Section 4, Rule 115 (now Rule 117) [3]. The Judge suggested bringing the matter to the Supreme Court [4]. However, pending the resolution of this petition, the main criminal case was terminated, resulting in the acquittal of the accused [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petition is moot and academic. The Court found that Criminal Case No. 2639 had already been terminated with the acquittal of the accused, Lauro G. Marquez [4]. Since the question involved in the petition regarding the taking of depositions was only incidental to the said criminal case, it no longer presented a justiciable controversy [4].

Accordingly, the petition was dismissed [4, 5].
