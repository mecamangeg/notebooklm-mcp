I. CAPTION
AGATON BULAONG v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19344, July 27, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 31, 1956, Petitioner Agaton Bulaong was charged with rebellion before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Laguna [1]. While he was at large, the Anti-Subversion Act (Republic Act No. 1700) took effect in 1957 [1]. Following his arrest in 1958, the rebellion information in Laguna was amended [1]. On the same date, a separate information for subversion under RA 1700 was filed against him in the CFI of Manila [2].

The CFI of Laguna convicted Bulaong of rebellion, sentencing him to ten years of *prision mayor* and a fine [3, 4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3]. Bulaong appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that rebellion is a lesser cognate offense of subversion and that he cannot be prosecuted for both based on the same facts without being placed in double jeopardy [5]. The subversion case in Manila remained pending at the time of the appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the accused can interpose the defense of double jeopardy in the rebellion case due to the pending subversion case filed against him.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The defense of double jeopardy is not available. Under Section 9, Rule 113 (now Rule 117) of the Rules of Court, double jeopardy exists only when the accused has been either convicted or acquitted, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his consent [6].

In this case, Bulaong had not yet been convicted or acquitted in the subversion case filed in the CFI of Manila, nor was that case dismissed or terminated; it was still pending [6]. Consequently, the requisites for double jeopardy were not met. The Court noted that Bulaong's proper remedy might be to direct his plea to the CFI of Manila, as his final conviction in the rebellion case (the case at bar) would preclude further prosecution there, assuming the charges constitute the same or cognate offenses [5].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justice Barrera concurred in the result [4].
