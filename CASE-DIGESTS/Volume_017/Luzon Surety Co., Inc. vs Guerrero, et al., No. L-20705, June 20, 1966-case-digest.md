I. CAPTION
LUZON SURETY CO., INC. v. RAFAEL P. GUERRERO, SR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-20705, June 20, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rafael P. Guerrero, Sr. obtained a favorable judgment in an ejectment case against Spouses Navarro. To prevent the execution of the judgment, the Navarros filed a petition for relief with the Court of First Instance and obtained a writ of preliminary injunction upon filing a P600.00 bond subscribed by petitioner Luzon Surety Co., Inc. The court subsequently dismissed the petition for relief due to failure to prosecute and held the bond liable for damages. Upon Guerrero's *ex-parte* motion, the court issued a writ of execution against Luzon Surety's bond. Luzon Surety moved to set aside the order and writ for lack of notice and hearing, but the motion was denied. Hence, this petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of execution may be issued against an injunction bond without prior notice and hearing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A writ of execution cannot be issued against an injunction bond without the notice and hearing required by law. Pursuant to Section 9, Rule 60 and Section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court (now Section 9, Rule 58 in relation to Section 20, Rule 57), the party enjoined must make a formal claim for damages and said claim must be set for hearing. This requirement is intended to give the claimant an opportunity to prove damages and the surety an opportunity to defend itself [1, 2]. Since the trial court issued the order of execution *ex parte* without such hearing, the order and the subsequent writ are void [1, 3].

The petition is **GRANTED**. However, upon Motion for Reconsideration, the Supreme Court noted that Guerrero’s previous motions substantially complied with the requirement of filing a claim for damages within the same action [4, 5]. Thus, the Lower Court is **DIRECTED** to hold the required hearing on the claim for damages and determine the same [5].
