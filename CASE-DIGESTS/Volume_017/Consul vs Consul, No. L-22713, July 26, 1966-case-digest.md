I. CAPTION
TERESITA M. CONSUL v. JESUS L. CONSUL, G.R. No. L-22713, July 26, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Teresita Consul filed a case for support against defendant Jesus Consul in the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1, 2]. Jesus was declared in default on September 21, 1963, and a judgment by default was rendered ordering him to pay P400.00 monthly [2]. Jesus learned of the judgment later and filed a verified petition for relief from judgment, alleging that the default was due to mistake or fraud and that he had a meritorious defense based on an amicable settlement that contradicted the default judgment [3-5]. The trial court denied the petition solely because it was not accompanied by a separate affidavit of merits as required by the Rules of Court, even though the petition itself was verified and contained the facts constituting his defense [6]. Jesus appealed to the Supreme Court on a pure question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the verified petition for relief from judgment should be denied for lack of a separate affidavit of merits.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the absence of a separate affidavit of merits is a defect of form, not of substance, and is of *de minimis* importance where the petition for relief is verified by the petitioner himself [7, 8]. The Court reasoned that the purpose of an affidavit of merits is to ensure that the machinery of justice does not grind anew for a futile cause; since the merits of the petitioner's case were apparent in the recitals of the verified petition, the oath elevated the petition to the same category as a separate affidavit [7, 8].

The Court applied the principle of liberal construction of the rules under Section 2, Rule 1, harmonizing it with the requirement for affidavits in Section 3, Rule 38 [9]. Citing *Gonzales and Mauricio vs. Francisco*, the Court ruled that a verified petition constitutes a reasonable "equivalent" to the required affidavit, and to require a separate document would compel the petitioner to do the unnecessary [8, 10].

The orders denying the petition for relief were **SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** to the court of origin for further proceedings [11].
