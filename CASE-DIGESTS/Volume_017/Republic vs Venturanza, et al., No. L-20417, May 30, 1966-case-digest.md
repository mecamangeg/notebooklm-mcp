I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, represented by the Land Tenure Administration v. GREGORIO A. VENTURANZA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20417, May 30, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines, through the Land Tenure Administration, filed a complaint for the expropriation of two parcels of land (approximately 6 hectares) in Cagayan de Oro City owned by spouses Gregorio and Mary Venturanza. The purpose was to subdivide the land for resale to its occupants. In their Answer, the Venturanzas admitted the Republic's right to expropriate the land. The parties agreed to submit the case to the lower court solely for the purpose of fixing the price (just compensation). The Court of First Instance rendered a decision fixing the compensation at P120,590.00.

The Venturanzas appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing for the first time that the lower court lacked jurisdiction. They contended that under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act), the power to expropriate applies only to private agricultural lands in excess of 300 hectares, and their land was only 6 hectares. They also contested the amount of compensation fixed by the trial court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the expropriation case because the land area was below the statutory threshold of 300 hectares.
2. W/N the defendants may question the plaintiff's right to expropriate for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appellants confused "jurisdiction" with "cause of action." Jurisdiction is the authority of a court to hear and decide a case, which depends on jurisdiction over the subject matter, the parties, and the *res*. The lower court clearly had original exclusive jurisdiction over expropriation cases. The argument regarding the 300-hectare limitation under R.A. 1400 pertains to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's cause of action, not the court's jurisdiction. A lack of cause of action does not divest a court of its authority to decide a case if it has jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the appellants are barred from questioning the plaintiff's right to expropriate. In their Answer, they expressly admitted the Republic's right to acquire the property and limited the issue solely to just compensation. Parties are not permitted to change the fundamental nature of the issue or raise new questions of fact or law for the first time on appeal.

The decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED** *in toto*.
