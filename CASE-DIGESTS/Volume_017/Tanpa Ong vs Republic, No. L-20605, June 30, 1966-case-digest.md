I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TANPA ONG alias PEDRO TAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TANPA ONG alias PEDRO TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20605, June 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tanpa Ong, a Chinese citizen married with seven children, filed a petition for naturalization in 1958, claiming an annual income of P3,000.00 as a salesman [1, 2]. The Court of First Instance of Cagayan granted the petition [1]. On May 9, 1962, the court issued an order allowing the petitioner to take his oath of allegiance [3]. On May 15, 1962, the Provincial Fiscal manifested that he would not appeal the order, and the petitioner took his oath and received his certificate of naturalization that same day [3]. The Solicitor General received notice of these events on May 25, 1962, and subsequently filed a motion to set aside the oath and cancel the certificate, arguing that the petitioner lacked a lucrative income and that the oath was premature [3, 4]. The lower court denied the motion, prompting the Republic's appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses the required lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the administration of the oath was valid despite the appeal period not having expired.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual income of P3,000.00 is not sufficient to meet the high cost of living for an applicant with a wife and seven children to support [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that the applicant himself must possess the "known lucrative trade," making the wife's additional income immaterial [7, 8]. Furthermore, allowances are not considered in determining the lucrativeness of income as they are contingent, and any increase in income after the filing of the petition cannot be taken into account [7-9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the oath was administered prematurely because the 30-day appeal period had not yet expired when the oath was taken on May 15, 1962, only six days after the order was issued [6, 10, 11]. The Provincial Fiscal's manifestation that he would not appeal did not divest the Solicitor General of control over the State's defense, nor did it make the judgment final, as the Solicitor General remains the counsel of record [12, 13]. The State may inquire into an applicant's qualifications at any stage of the proceedings [14, 15].

The decision is REVERSED, and the oath of allegiance and certificate of citizenship are declared NULL and VOID [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred with the ruling [16].
