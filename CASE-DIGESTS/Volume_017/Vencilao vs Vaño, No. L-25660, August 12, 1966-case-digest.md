I. CAPTION
LEOPOLDO VENCILAO, ET AL. v. TEODORO VAÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25660, August 12, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Bohol to be declared owners of certain parcels of land and to compel defendants-appellees to execute deeds of reconveyance [1]. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. The trial court granted the dismissal with respect to 15 specific plaintiffs on the ground of *res judicata*, but denied it regarding the remaining plaintiffs [2]. Subsequently, the remaining plaintiffs moved to declare the defendants in default, which the trial court denied [3]. The plaintiffs appealed both the order dismissing the complaint as to the 15 plaintiffs and the order denying the motion to declare defendants in default [3]. Defendants filed a motion in the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal pursuant to Rule 50, Section 1(i) of the Rules of Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order dismissing the case on the ground of *res judicata* is appealable.
2. W/N the order denying the motion to declare defendants in default is appealable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The order dismissing the case with respect to the 15 plaintiffs is a **final order**. The Court held that this order is a final disposition of the case as far as those specific plaintiffs are concerned, making it appealable [4].

2. **NO.** The order denying the plaintiffs' motion to declare defendants in default is clearly of an **interlocutory character** [4]. Unlike a final order, an interlocutory order does not dispose of the case completely but leaves something to be done upon the merits. Consequently, an appeal cannot be taken from such an order [4].

The appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal is **GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART**. The appeal is dismissed insofar as it is taken from the order denying the motion to declare defendants in default, but it is allowed to proceed regarding the order dismissing the complaint with respect to the 15 plaintiffs [4].
