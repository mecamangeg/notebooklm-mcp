I. CAPTION
ANGELA RODRIGUEZ, MARIA RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v. HON. JUAN DE BORJA, ANATOLIA PANGILINAN, and ADELAIDA JACALAN, G.R. No. L-21993, June 21, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Fr. Celestino Rodriguez died on February 12, 1963 [1]. On March 4, 1963, respondents Pangilinan and Jacalan delivered his purported last will and testament to the Clerk of Court of Bulacan [1]. On March 12, 1963 at 8:00 A.M., petitioners Rodriguez filed a petition for the settlement of the intestate estate of the deceased in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, alleging he was a resident of Parañaque [1]. Later that same day, at 11:00 A.M., respondents filed a petition for the probate of the will in the CFI of Bulacan [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the Bulacan proceedings, arguing that the CFI of Rizal acquired jurisdiction first by filing the intestate petition earlier [2]. The CFI of Bulacan denied the motion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI of Bulacan has jurisdiction over the settlement of the estate to the exclusion of the CFI of Rizal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction of the CFI of Bulacan became vested upon the delivery of the will on March 4, 1963, even if no petition for its allowance was filed until later [4]. Under Section 3, Rule 76 of the Revised Rules of Court, the court may act *motu proprio* upon the mere deposit of a decedent's testament, and the subsequent petition for probate is deemed to relate back to the time of delivery [5].

Furthermore, intestate succession is merely subsidiary or subordinate to testate succession, taking place only in the absence of a valid will [6]. Therefore, intestate proceedings in one court cannot proceed while the probate of a purported will is pending in another [7]. The Court also clarified that the domicile of the testator affects only the venue, not the jurisdiction, which is conferred by law upon all Courts of First Instance [8]. The petition for certiorari and prohibition is **DENIED** [9].
