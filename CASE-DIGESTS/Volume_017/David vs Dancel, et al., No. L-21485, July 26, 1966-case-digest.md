I. CAPTION
JUSTINO L. DAVID v. ANGEL DANCEL, THE CITY TREASURER, THE CITY AUDITOR, THE MAYOR OF MANILA, and the COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE, G.R. No. L-21485, July 26, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Following the death of the Chief of the Real Estate Division in the Manila City Treasurer's Office, a vacancy occurred for the position of Chief, Tax Registration Section [1]. Petitioner Justino David, a lawyer and the next-in-rank employee with an efficiency rating of 84%, protested the appointment of Respondent Angel Dancel to the vacancy [1, 2]. Dancel had been appointed by the Mayor upon the City Treasurer's recommendation and had an efficiency rating of 90% [1, 3]. The Civil Service Commissioner dismissed David's protest because Executive Order No. 503 required an efficiency rating of 85% for promotion [2].

David filed a petition for *quo warranto* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the position required First Grade eligibility [4]. While David passed the Bar, the court held he was considered First Grade eligible under RA 1080 only for positions involving legal knowledge, which the disputed position did not require [4]. David appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is considered a First Grade civil service eligible for the position of Chief, Tax Registration Section under RA 1080.
2. W/N the petitioner was qualified for promotion despite having an efficiency rating of 84%, below the requirement of EO 503.
3. W/N the petitioner is entitled to the writ of *quo warranto*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1080, as amended by RA 1844, passing the bar examination is considered equivalent to First Grade eligibility only for positions "the duties of which involve knowledge of the respective professions" [6, 7]. For positions that do not require such professional knowledge, the eligibility is equivalent only to the Second Grade [8]. The Court found that the position of Chief, Tax Registration Section does not require professional knowledge of the law; thus, the petitioner is considered only a Second Grade eligible for this specific position [8].

2. **NO.** Executive Order No. 503, series of 1934, prescribes a minimum efficiency rating of 85% for promotion [2, 3]. This was not repealed by the mere Compilation of Civil Service Laws and Rules, as laws are repealed only by subsequent laws under Article 7 of the Civil Code [9]. Consequently, David's rating of 84% at the time of the appointment disqualified him [3]. The Court emphasized that the efficiency rating at the time the promotion is made determines competence, not a subsequent rating [10].

3. **NO.** To maintain an action for *quo warranto*, the petitioner must show a clear right to the disputed position [11]. Since the petitioner failed to meet the First Grade eligibility requirement for the specific item and the minimum efficiency rating for promotion, he has no right to the office [3, 12]. The appointment of Dancel involved the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority [13].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED [14].
