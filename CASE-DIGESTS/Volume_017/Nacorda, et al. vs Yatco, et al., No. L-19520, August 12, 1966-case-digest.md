I. CAPTION
FELIPE NACORDA and LUZ NACORDA v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, as Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Quezon City Branch), J.M. TUASON & CO., INC., and THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-19520, August 12, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed a suit (Civil Case No. Q-4108) against Fernando Castro to recover possession of a parcel of land covered by the corporation's title. In August 1959, the Court of First Instance of Rizal, presided by Judge Nicasio Yatco, rendered judgment in favor of the corporation, ordering Castro’s ejectment and payment of damages. This judgment became final, and a writ of execution and demolition was issued on October 9, 1959 [1, 2].

On February 22, 1960, petitioners Felipe and Luz Nacorda filed a petition in the same case to lift the writ, alleging they were the true owners of the land and that Castro was merely their tenant. Judge Yatco denied this petition. Subsequently, the Nacordas filed a separate action for declaration of ownership (Civil Case No. 5053) in another branch of the same court. When Judge Yatco issued an order in February 1962 giving Castro 30 days to vacate, the Nacordas filed this original petition for injunction with the Supreme Court, admitting that the other branch could not enjoin a coordinate branch, and sought to stop the execution of the judgment in the ejectment case [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for injunction is the proper remedy to prevent the execution of a final judgment in an ejectment case based on a third party's claim of ownership.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that injunction is an ancillary writ and cannot be resorted to for the purpose of preventing the enforcement of a judgment that has already become final, except possibly in a proper action to annul such judgment [4]. The validity of the judgment in the ejectment case (Civil Case No. Q-4108) was not questioned by the parties involved. The petitioners’ bare claim of ownership is not a valid reason to obstruct a judgment duly rendered against another party, particularly because the ejectment case merely involved the issue of possession, not ownership [4]. The proper remedy for the petitioners is the reivindicatory action (Civil Case No. 5053) which they had already filed and should pursue to its conclusion [4].

The writ prayed for is denied and the petition is dismissed, with costs [5].
