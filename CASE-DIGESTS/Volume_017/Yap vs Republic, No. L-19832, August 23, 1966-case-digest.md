I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. BERNARDO YAP v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19832, August 23, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bernardo Yap, a Chinese citizen born in Cebu City, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu on January 30, 1961 [1]. In his petition, he stated his present residence in Cebu City and one former residence [1]. However, during the hearing, he admitted that he had also resided in Bohol during the Japanese occupation when he was a child, a fact he omitted from the petition [2]. Yap claimed to be employed as a sales agent with a monthly salary of P200 starting only 30 days before filing the petition, while simultaneously enrolled as a third-year chemical engineering student [3, 4]. His character witnesses admitted that while Yap studied high school in Manila, they only saw him during holidays in Cebu and had no contact with him in Manila [5]. The CFI granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [2, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to state a former residence during childhood is a fatal defect in a naturalization petition.
2. W/N the character witnesses were competent to vouch for the petitioner's irreproachable conduct.
3. W/N the petitioner proved lucrative employment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to state all places of residence violates Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act 473) and is a fatal defect warranting dismissal [2, 7]. The requirement is designed to facilitate the government's investigation into the petitioner's fitness [2]. This omission amounts to falsifying the truth, indicating a lack of good moral character, and cannot be cured by supplying the information during the trial [8, 9]. The fact that the petitioner was only "3 to 5 years" old when he resided in Bohol does not constitute a valid excuse for the omission [7, 9].

2. **NO.** The law requires proof of proper and irreproachable conduct during the *entire* period of the alien's residence in the Philippines [10]. Since the witnesses had no contact with the petitioner while he studied in Manila, they were incompetent to vouch for his moral character during that period [5, 10]. Furthermore, the petitioner's failure to update his Alien Certificate of Registration regarding his change of address and employment violated the Alien Registration Act of 1950, further indicating a lack of proper conduct [4].

3. **NO.** The Court found the alleged employment to be "pure fiction" [4]. The claim was based on a bare averment of employment starting shortly before filing, unsupported by payrolls or books of accounts, and was incredible given that the petitioner was a full-time engineering student whose studies demanded most of his time [4, 11].

The judgment of the lower court is REVERSED and the petition is DENIED [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Makalintal, J. concurred in the result [12].
