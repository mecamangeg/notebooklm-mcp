I. CAPTION
ANDRES CULANAG v. DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, G.R. No. L-25419, June 21, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Culanag was previously convicted of falsification of public documents by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Lanao del Norte and was later released on parole. Subsequently, he was charged in the Municipal Court of Mamburao with a new count of falsification of public documents and violation of conditional pardon. Culanag moved to quash the informations on the ground of double jeopardy, arguing the new falsification charge was the same offense as his prior conviction. The motion was denied. Culanag pleaded guilty to both charges, was sentenced, and did not appeal [1-4].

While serving his sentence, Culanag filed a petition for *habeas corpus* in the CFI of Rizal, claiming his detention was illegal because the Mamburao judgments were void due to double jeopardy. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the grounds relied upon were not proper for *habeas corpus* proceedings. Culanag appealed to the Supreme Court [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a writ of *habeas corpus* is the proper remedy to challenge a final judgment of conviction on the ground of double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The writ of *habeas corpus* functions to inquire into the cause of detention, but when a party is in custody under process, the inquiry is limited to the jurisdiction of the court and the validity of the process on its face [7, 8]. It is not a writ of error. A commitment based on a final judgment in a criminal case is conclusive evidence of the legality of detention unless the sentencing court lacked jurisdiction [9].

The defense of double jeopardy must be pleaded at arraignment and does not go to the jurisdiction of the trial court; it involves an error of judgment that is not reviewable upon *habeas corpus* [10]. Petitioner's remedy for the alleged error by the Municipal Court was an appeal, which he failed to take [11]. Furthermore, the Court noted that there was no double jeopardy in fact, as the offenses charged in Mamburao were distinct from the prior offense in Lanao del Norte [12].

Order affirmed [13].
