I. CAPTION
DOMINGA TORRES v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, J.M. TUASON & Co., INC. and SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-20906, July 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On January 7, 1959, respondent J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. filed Civil Case No. Q-3674 against Isidro Conisido to recover possession of a parcel of land in Quezon City [1]. Conisido answered that he was a mere tenant of petitioner Dominga Torres, who owned the land and the house thereon [1]. During trial, Torres testified as a defense witness, asserting she bought the lot in 1951 and built a house worth P500 [2]. Although Torres was not formally impleaded as a defendant, the trial court rendered judgment for Tuason, ordering Conisido and all persons claiming under him to vacate [2].

Conisido appealed to the Court of Appeals, arguing the case should be dismissed for non-joinder of Torres as an indispensable party, but the CA affirmed the decision [3]. When the judgment became executory and a demolition order was issued, Torres filed a Third-Party Claim and subsequently this petition for certiorari and prohibition, seeking to enjoin the execution on the ground that she was not a party to the case [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the judgment is binding on the petitioner despite her not being formally impleaded as a party defendant.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner is bound by the proceedings. The principle of due process essentially requires that a party be notified or impleaded to have the opportunity to defend their rights [5]. In this case, Torres testified as a witness for the defendant and squarely laid her claim of ownership before the court, which was subsequently overruled [6, 7]. She had full opportunity to be heard and had her day in court [6, 7].

The failure to formally implead her is a mere technicality that does not serve the administration of justice [7]. Citing *Alonso v. Villamor*, the Court emphasized that technicalities should be ignored when they do not serve the purpose of the law [7, 8]. Furthermore, under Rule 10, Section 5 of the Rules of Court, the failure to implead may be cured at any stage by amending the complaint to conform to the records and proceedings [9].

Petition denied [9].
