I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. IGNACIO VILLALBA, G.R. No. L-17243, August 23, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of November 17, 1956, in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, the victim Ignacio Cabanada was walking home with a group after playing a game of "palatunton." As they passed a pathway, the accused, Ignacio Villalba, suddenly emerged from tall palay stalks behind Cabanada. Villalba hacked Cabanada with a bolo, hitting him on the right forehead and left elbow. Cabanada died the following day due to shock and hemorrhage.

Villalba was charged with murder. During trial, he claimed self-defense. However, witnesses—including those presented by the defense—corroborated the prosecution's version of the events. Villalba also argued he had no motive to kill the deceased. The Court of First Instance convicted Villalba of murder. Villalba appealed, questioning the credibility of witnesses and relying on letters allegedly written by the victim’s wife suggesting the victim was at fault, which had prompted a provisional dismissal of an earlier information.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N motive is essential to convict the accused.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that motive is unessential to conviction in murder cases when there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit [1, 2]. Here, the accused was positively identified by eyewitnesses, including two witnesses for the defense [3]. Furthermore, the Court found that the accused harbored resentment against the deceased due to a previous altercation regarding payment for a pig [2]. Regarding the letters from the victim's wife, the Court ruled they were hearsay and could not prevail over positive eyewitness testimony [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the attack constituted treachery. The evidence showed that Villalba suddenly emerged from concealment (tall palay stalks) and immediately hacked the deceased. Such a sudden and unexpected attack constitutes treachery, qualifying the crime to murder [5, 6].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred. Justice Regala was on leave.
