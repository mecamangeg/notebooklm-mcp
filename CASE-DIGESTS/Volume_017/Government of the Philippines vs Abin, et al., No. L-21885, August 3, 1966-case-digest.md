**I. CAPTION**
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, represented by the Director of Lands v. BONIFACIO ABIN, ET AL. (ANTONIO P. CHUA, Movant-Appellant), G.R. No. L-21885, August 3, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Apolinaria Tabuena was the claimant of Lot No. 3276 in a cadastral case in Sorsogon [1]. She died during the proceedings, and on April 26, 1928, the Cadastral Court awarded the lot to her heirs, subject to creditors' claims [1]. The special administrator of her estate sold the lot to the Sorsogon Chinese School to pay debts, a sale approved by the probate court [2]. The lot was subsequently sold to Chua Mang, and later to the movant-appellant, Antonio P. Chua [2, 3].

On January 7, 1963, Antonio P. Chua filed a motion praying for the issuance of a final decree of registration for the lot in the name of the original applicant, subject to his rights [3]. The Cadastral Court denied the motion and his subsequent motions for reconsideration, ruling that Chua had no right to be substituted as he did not derive title from the heirs [3, 4]. Crucially, the heirs of Apolinaria Tabuena—who were the adjudicated owners of the lot—were never given notice of Chua’s motion or the subsequent proceedings [3, 5]. Chua appealed the denial to the Supreme Court [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the motion for issuance of a final decree may be resolved without notice to the heirs of the original adjudicatee.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that it is more in consonance with practical justice and the requirements of due process that the case be not decided upon the merits until an opportunity to be heard is given to the heirs in whose names the land was adjudicated [5, 6]. The records showed that the heirs of Apolinaria Tabuena were not given notice of the appellant’s motion or the subsequent motions for reconsideration [5]. Citing *Capio v. Capio* (94 Phil. 113), the Court ruled that where a hearing touching upon the merits is held in the absence of an heir of a deceased adjudicatee, the trial court must hold a regular and formal hearing with notice to all parties [7].

The appealed order was **SET ASIDE**, and the lower court was ordered to hold a regular and formal hearing of the motion with notice to the heirs of Apolinaria Tabuena [8].
