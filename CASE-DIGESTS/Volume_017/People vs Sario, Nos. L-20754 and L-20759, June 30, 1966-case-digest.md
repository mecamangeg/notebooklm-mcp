I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CARMEN SARIO, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-20754, L-20755, L-20756, L-20757, L-20758, and L-20759, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Six informations for grave oral defamation were filed in the Court of First Instance of Quezon against accused Carmen Sario, Dulce Sario, Asuncion Requiron, and Francisco Sario. The informations alleged that the accused, with intent to dishonor complainant Ester Peña, publicly called her a "mangkukulam" (witch) and "aswang" (sorceress). Specific allegations included attributing the illness and death of certain individuals to Peña's witchcraft and claiming she inherited the power from her father and passed it to her child [1-5]. Before arraignment, the accused filed a motion to quash, arguing that the facts alleged did not constitute a punishable offense. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the cases. The prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the cases to the Supreme Court as they involved a question of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imputation of being a "mangkukulam" or "aswang" constitutes a punishable offense of oral defamation under the Revised Penal Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the statements are defamatory. Under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code, a public and malicious imputation of a vice or defect, whether real or imaginary, is libelous [7]. To call someone a "mangkukulam" or "aswang" is to impute a vice, condition, or status that is dishonorable and contemptible, as it accuses the person of employing black art, possessing supernatural power via a covenant with evil spirits, and trafficking with the devil [8, 9].

The Court held that for an imputation to be punishable, the vice need not be real; an imaginary vice is sufficient [9, 10]. Although belief in witchcraft may be *passé*, these terms are accepted words of derision, rendering the person labeled an object of contempt and odium [9, 10]. Furthermore, accusing the complainant of killing persons through witchcraft imputes a crime [11], and claiming she taught her child evil practices is immoral and highly reprehensible [12-14].

The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the cases were returned to the lower court for further proceedings [15].
