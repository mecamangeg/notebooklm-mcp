I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF GENARO YAP alias YAP KIM GUAN FOR AMENDMENT OF ENTRIES IN THE CIVIL REGISTRY OF BIRTHS OF HIS MINOR CHILDREN; GENARO YAP alias YAP KIM GUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21959, June 30, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Genaro Yap was granted Philippine citizenship and took his oath of allegiance on March 20, 1962. Subsequently, he filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Cebu to amend the birth records of his four minor legitimate children, who were born in Cebu, to reflect his naturalization and their admission to Philippine citizenship [1, 2]. The trial court granted the petition and ordered the Local Civil Registrar to record that the children's citizenship had changed automatically from "Chinese" to "Filipino" [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that Rule 108 of the Rules of Court only authorizes the cancellation or correction of entries, and since the birth records were correct at the time of entry, there was nothing to correct [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the birth records of the petitioner's minor children may be annotated to reflect the father's naturalization.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the original entries in the birth records were correct when made and should not be erased, altered, or tampered with, the change in the father's status should be noted [5]. Article 407 of the Civil Code provides that "acts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of persons shall be recorded in the civil register" [6]. Since the minor children of a naturalized citizen residing in the Philippines automatically become citizens upon the father's naturalization (*Tiu Peng Hong v. Republic*), this change in status is a matter of public concern that must be reflected in the registry [7]. The Court held that the proper procedure is not to change the original entry, but to add a supplement or annotation to the records stating that the father was granted Philippine citizenship [5].

Accordingly, the judgment was modified, ordering the Local Civil Registrar to merely annotate the fact of the petitioner’s naturalization on the children's birth records [5, 8].
