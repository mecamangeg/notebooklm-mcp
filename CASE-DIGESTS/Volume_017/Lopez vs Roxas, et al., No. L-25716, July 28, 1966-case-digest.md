**I. CAPTION**
FERNANDO LOPEZ, petitioner, vs. GERARDO ROXAS and PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL, respondents., G.R. No. L-25716, July 28, 1966, 17 SCRA 756, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Fernando Lopez and respondent Gerardo Roxas were the main contenders for Vice-President in the November 9, 1965 general elections. On December 17, 1965, Congress proclaimed Lopez elected with a plurality of 26,724 votes. On January 5, 1966, Roxas filed Election Protest No. 2 with the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), contesting Lopez's election.

Lopez instituted an original action for prohibition with the Supreme Court to prevent the PET from hearing the contest. Lopez argued that Republic Act No. 1793, which created the PET, was unconstitutional because: (1) it created a court inferior to the Supreme Court but composed of its Justices; (2) it effectively appointed the Justices to a new office without proper appointment; (3) the Constitution does not authorize election contests for President and Vice-President; and (4) a recount by PET is inconsistent with the exclusive power of Congress to canvass election returns.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Republic Act No. 1793, creating the Presidential Electoral Tribunal composed of the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, is unconstitutional.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court dismissed the petition and upheld the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 1793.

The Court held that RA 1793 did not create a new or separate court but merely conferred upon the Supreme Court the **functions** of a Presidential Electoral Tribunal. The PET is not inferior to the Supreme Court because it is the same Court, though exercising functions more limited in scope than its ordinary functions [1]. This is analogous to a Court of First Instance performing distinct functions as a probate or land registration court [2].

The power to judge election contests is essentially judicial and belongs exclusively to the judicial department under the separation of powers, except where the Constitution provides otherwise (e.g., Electoral Tribunals for Congress under Art. VI, Sec. 11) [3, 4]. The Constitution's silence on presidential election contests does not preclude Congress from enacting laws to allow them; rather, it allows Congress to determine which court shall have jurisdiction [5].

Furthermore, the PET's judicial power to determine the true results of an election (including recounting ballots) is distinct from and not inconsistent with Congress's ministerial and executive duty to canvass election returns under Article VII, Section 2 of the Constitution [6, 7]. Finally, imposing these additional duties on the Supreme Court Justices does not constitute the creation of a new office or the appointment of new officers, but merely the vesting of additional jurisdiction [8].

Petition dismissed.
