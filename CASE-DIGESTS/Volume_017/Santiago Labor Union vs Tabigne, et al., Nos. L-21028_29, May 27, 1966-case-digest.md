I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO LABOR UNION alias MAGAT LABOR UNION v. HON. EMILIANO TABIGNE, KING HONG & COMPANY and SANTIAGO RICE MILL, G.R. Nos. L-21028–29, May 27, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santiago Labor Union obtained a favorable judgment from the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) *en banc* awarding overtime pay, premium compensation, and back wages against private respondents King Hong & Company and Santiago Rice Mill. This decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court on August 31, 1962 (G.R. No. L-18040) [1]. Petitioner filed five motions seeking execution, attachment, or the posting of a bond, alleging that the respondent Judge Tabigne failed to act on them while private respondents threatened to dispose of their properties [1, 2]. Consequently, Petitioner filed a petition for *mandamus* to compel Judge Tabigne to resolve the motions and issue a writ of execution or require a bond [3]. However, records showed that on September 5, 1962, the Judge directed a court examiner to determine the specific amounts due, as the decision did not fix them, and on March 30, 1963, issued an order requiring respondents to deposit P100,000.00 and post a surety bond [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the writ of mandamus should issue to compel the respondent judge to resolve the motions for execution and bond in a particular way.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that while *mandamus* can compel a judge to act on pending motions, it cannot direct him to decide them in a particular way, as the resolution involves the exercise of judicial discretion [2]. Judges have the right to decide questions according to their own judgment and understanding of the law; if such decision is incorrect, the proper remedy is appeal, not *mandamus* (*Lupisan v. Alfonso*; *De Castro v. Court of Appeals*; *Morada v. Caluag*) [2].

In this case, the Petitioner sought to have the motions resolved specifically in its favor, which contradicts the established doctrine [2]. Furthermore, the Court found no abuse of discretion, as the Judge properly ordered the computation of unfixed amounts and required a substantial deposit and bond to protect the Petitioner's interests [4].

Petition denied [5].
