I. CAPTION
NASIPIT LABOR UNION (MFL) v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, NASIPIT STEVEDORING CO., INC., and OLIVIO G. RUIZ, G.R. No. L-17838, August 3, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On October 2, 1958, petitioner Nasipit Labor Union (NLU) and respondent Nasipit Stevedoring Co., Inc. entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). On September 7, 1959, NLU filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan (Civil Case No. 748) against the Company for the enforcement of the CBA and damages. While this case was pending, NLU filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) on March 22, 1960 (Case 2175-ULP), alleging that the Company acted in bad faith by entering into a closed-shop agreement with another union, the Young Men Labor Union Stevedores (YMLUS). The Company moved to dismiss the CIR case, arguing that the CIR lacked jurisdiction as the case was essentially for the enforcement of a contract. The CIR granted the motion and dismissed the case. NLU appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the case which seeks the enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under Republic Act No. 875, the jurisdiction of the CIR is narrowed to cases involving: (1) labor disputes in industries indispensable to the national interest certified by the President; (2) the Minimum Wage Law; (3) the Eight-Hour Labor Law; and (4) unfair labor practices [1].

The Court held that an action to enforce a collective bargaining agreement does not fall within the CIR's jurisdiction unless it is interwoven with charges of unfair labor practice or involves minimum wage or hours of employment violations [2]. In this case, the Court found that the allegations of ULP were not *bona fide* but were merely a maneuver to divest the CFI of jurisdiction over the pending Civil Case No. 748, where the relief sought (enforcement of the CBA) was identical to that in the CIR case [3, 4]. Since the principal aim was contract enforcement, the regular courts (CFI), not the CIR, have jurisdiction.

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**.
