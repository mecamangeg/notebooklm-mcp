I. CAPTION
JOSE C. ZULUETA, BENITO MACROHON, as Provincial Sheriff of Rizal, and HON. ANDRES S. SIOCHI, as Municipal Judge of Pasig, Rizal v. HON. CECILIA MUÑOZ, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch I, VICTORIA LASIN VDA. DE ATIENZA, GREGORIO ATIENZA, and ROSARIO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-25635, August 23, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 15, 1964, petitioner Jose C. Zulueta filed an ejectment case against respondent Gregorio Atienza in the Municipal Court of Pasig (Civil Case No. 938). At the time, Gregorio was serving in the U.S. Navy and residing in California. The sheriff served summons on Gregorio's sister, respondent Rosario de Guzman, in Pasig. Gregorio was declared in default, and the court rendered judgment against him. A writ of execution was issued, and personal properties were levied.

Gregorio's mother, Victoria Lasin Vda. de Atienza, filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Civil Case No. 8913) to annul the ejectment decision. The CFI issued a restraining order. Zulueta moved to dismiss, arguing Victoria was not the real party in interest. Subsequently, Gregorio himself filed a motion for intervention to substitute his mother. The CFI (Judge Muñoz) granted the intervention and enjoined the sheriff from enforcing the execution. Rosario also filed a motion in the same CFI case to release the levied properties, claiming ownership. The CFI ordered the discharge of the levy. Zulueta filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, challenging the CFI's orders allowing the interventions and staying the execution.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the service of summons on the defendant's sister while he resided abroad was valid.
2. W/N the CFI committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing Gregorio Atienza to intervene and substitute the original petitioner who was not the real party in interest.
3. W/N a third-party claimant (Rosario) may intervene in the certiorari action to quash a levy on execution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that since the summons was delivered to the defendant's sister in Pasig while he was a resident of the United States, the service was not made in the manner provided by Section 17, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court regarding extraterritorial service or service upon residents temporarily out of the Philippines. Consequently, the municipal court did not acquire jurisdiction over his person.

2. **NO.** The defect of Victoria not being the real party in interest was merely formal, not jurisdictional. The CFI correctly allowed the petition to be amended or cured by the intervention of the son, Gregorio, who was the real party in interest. The Court cited *Alonso v. Villamor* (16 Phil. 315), holding that such substitution is a proper procedure to avoid technicalities that serve no useful purpose. The intervention was necessary to bring the real party in interest into court.

3. **YES.** (The Court affirmed the CFI's allowance of the intervention). Under Section 2, Rule 12 of the Revised Rules of Court, a person claiming ownership over levied properties may intervene in the action to ask that the writ be quashed. While the intervention was filed in the certiorari case (CFI) rather than the ejectment case (Municipal Court), this was proper because the CFI action was instituted precisely to annul the ejectment decision and proceedings, including the attachment. Citing *Manila Herald Publishing Co. v. Ramos* (88 Phil. 100), the Court affirmed that a third-party claimant is not limited to a separate action but may intervene to protect their rights.

**Petition denied.**
