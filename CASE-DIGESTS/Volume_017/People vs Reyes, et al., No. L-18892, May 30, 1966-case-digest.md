I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MAKALAHI REYES alias LARRY, EPITACIO ALDOVINO alias PEPE, SIMEON MAGBOO, FELIMON MAGBOO and GRACIANO MAGBOO, G.R. No. L-18892, May 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the afternoon of May 7, 1960, during the town fiesta of Alitagtag, Batangas, Reynaldo de Torres was stabbed to death while watching a game of "cara y cruz." Makalahi Reyes (alias Larry) first stabbed Reynaldo from behind. As Reynaldo turned, Reyes stabbed him again. Epitacio Aldovino (alias Pepe) then stabbed Reynaldo from behind, followed in rapid succession by Simeon, Felimon, and Graciano Magboo. The accused were members of the "Seven Lucky Gang" and held a grudge against the victim due to previous altercations.

The Court of First Instance of Batangas convicted all accused of murder, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*. While Makalahi Reyes admitted to the stabbing (claiming self-defense) and withdrew his appeal, the remaining appellants (Aldovino and the Magboos) appealed, relying on the defense of alibi. They claimed they were repairing a chapel in Barrio Mainaga, Mabini, fourteen kilometers away, at the time of the incident.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification by prosecution witnesses.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the accused such that the act of one is the act of all.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that alibi is a defense that can easily be fabricated and must be established by clear and positive evidence. It cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by credible witnesses who have no evil motive or bias [1, 2]. The Court found the testimony of the eyewitnesses (including the victim's brother) to be clear, accurate, and corroborated by the physical evidence [3, 4].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the appellants conspired to commit the offense. The evidence showed they were actuated by a single criminal design to kill the victim; they all used bladed weapons, attacked the deceased unexpectedly one after the other, and were members of the same gang [5]. The contention that Reyes acted alone in self-defense was belied by the physical evidence, specifically the serious wounds found on the victim's back [6]. Since conspiracy was established, the fact that not all wounds inflicted were fatal is of no consequence, as the act of one is the act of all [5].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
