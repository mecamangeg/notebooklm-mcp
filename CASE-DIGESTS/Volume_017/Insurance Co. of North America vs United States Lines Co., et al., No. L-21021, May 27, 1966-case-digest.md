I. CAPTION
INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA v. UNITED STATES LINES CO., MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-21021, May 27, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, Inc. was the consignee of 200 vibrator motors shipped on the SS "Pioneer Meer," operated by United States Lines Co. [1]. Upon arrival in Manila, the cargo was turned over to the arrastre operators, Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company [1]. A shortage of 69 motors valued at $465.88 was discovered [2]. The petitioner, Insurance Company of North America, paid the insurance claim of P1,042.76 to the consignee and was subrogated to its rights [2].

The petitioner filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) against both the carrier (United States Lines) and the arrastre operators in the alternative, seeking joint and several liability [3]. During the pendency of the case, the petitioner settled with the carrier, leading to the dismissal of the complaint against United States Lines [4]. Consequently, the arrastre operators moved to dismiss the case, arguing that with the admiralty aspect (the claim against the carrier) removed, the CFI lost jurisdiction because the remaining claim for P1,042.76 was below the jurisdictional amount of P5,000.00 [4]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance loses jurisdiction over a case when the admiralty aspect is dismissed, leaving only a claim below the jurisdictional amount.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal of the admiralty aspect of the case against the carrying vessel did not deprive the Court of First Instance of the jurisdiction it had already acquired over the case, even if the remaining issue concerned a claim worth less than the jurisdictional amount [5, 6].

The Court applied the established doctrine that jurisdiction, once acquired, continues until the termination of the case (*Tuvera vs. De Guzman*) and is not affected by the subsequent alteration of the facts or of the applicable law (*Sayoc vs. Roxas*) [5, 6]. Citing *Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. vs. Manila Railroad Company*, the Court reiterated that the subsequent dismissal of the carrier does not divest the court of authority to decide the remaining liability of the arrastre operator [5, 7].

The order of dismissal was set aside, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
