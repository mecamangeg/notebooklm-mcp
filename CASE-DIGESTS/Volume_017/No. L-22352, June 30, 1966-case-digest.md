I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, ENGRACIO CHAN (alias NICASIO LIM) v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22352, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Engracio Chan was born of Chinese parents in Manila on November 25, 1940 [1]. He is single and employed as a salesman at a store in Pasig, earning a monthly salary of P200.00 with free board and lodging [1]. Although his birth certificate bears the name "Engracio Chan," he has used the name "Nicasio Lim" in all his school records since childhood [2]. The Court of First Instance of Pampanga granted his petition for naturalization [3]. The Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the petitioner's income and conduct [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income as required by the Naturalization Law.
2. W/N the petitioner's unauthorized use of an alias disqualifies him from naturalization.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner does not possess a lucrative income. Even for an unmarried man with no dependents, a monthly salary of P200.00, combined with free board and lodging, is not considered gainful employment under the Naturalization Law [2]. The Court cited the precedent in *Yap v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-20372, May 14, 1966) to support this conclusion [3].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the petitioner's use of the name "Nicasio Lim" in school records, while legally named "Engracio Chan," violated the Anti-Alias Law because there was no proof of legal authority to use said alias [2]. This violation is indicative of reproachable conduct, which is a ground for disqualification from acquiring Filipino citizenship [4].

Accordingly, the judgment appealed from is REVERSED, and the petition is DENIED [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [5].
