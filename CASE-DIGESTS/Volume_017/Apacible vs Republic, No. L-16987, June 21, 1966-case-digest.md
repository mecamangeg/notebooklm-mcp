I. CAPTION
AMANDO ONG APACIBLE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16987, June 21, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 18, 1958, Amando Ong Apacible filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Rizal [1]. He admitted he had not filed a Declaration of Intention one year prior to the application, claiming exemption from the requirement on the ground that he was born in the Philippines and had resided continuously in the country for more than 30 years [2]. Because he could not produce his birth certificate, which he claimed was lost, he presented as secondary evidence a "Landing Certificate of Residence" (Exhibit E) issued to him upon his return from a boyhood visit to China [3]. The trial court granted the petition, finding him exempt from the declaration requirement [1, 4]. The Republic appealed, arguing the lower court erred in declaring the petitioner exempt and in assuming jurisdiction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a Declaration of Intention based on a Landing Certificate of Residence presented as proof of birth in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner is not exempt because he failed to prove he was born in the Philippines. Under Sections 5 and 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law, the exemption from filing a Declaration of Intention applies only to aliens *born* in the Philippines who have resided in the country for more than 30 years [2, 5, 6]. This exemption is strictly construed, and the evidence supporting it must be clear and convincing [7]. The Court held that a Landing Certificate of Residence is "utterly insufficient" to prove that an applicant was really born in the Philippines [7]. Accepting such a certificate as sufficient proof would encourage irregularities in naturalization proceedings [7]. Consequently, the lower court committed reversible error in declaring the petitioner exempt [8].

Decision reversed [8].
