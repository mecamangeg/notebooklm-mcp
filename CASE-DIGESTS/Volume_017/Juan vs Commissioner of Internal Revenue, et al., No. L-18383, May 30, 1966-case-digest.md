I. CAPTION
CELESTINO C. JUAN v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-18383, May 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Celestino Juan was assessed deficiency income taxes for the years 1947 to 1951. After several reinvestigations and a new assessment issued in 1957, petitioner signed a waiver of the statute of limitations. On December 15, 1959, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued a warrant of distraint and levy to summarily collect the taxes. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) and filed a motion to suspend the collection. On January 4, 1961, the CTA granted the motion but conditioned the suspension on the filing of a P75,000 bond [1]. Petitioner moved for reconsideration, arguing the warrant was void due to prescription and seeking the removal of the bond requirement. The CTA denied this motion on March 13, 1961 [2]. Petitioner then appealed these two resolutions to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal from the resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals is premature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal is premature because the resolutions in question are interlocutory in character [3, 4]. Under Rule 44, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, an appeal is authorized only from a final award, order, or decision [4]. The first resolution merely granted the suspension of collection conditioned on a bond pursuant to Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, while the second resolution only denied the motion to declare the warrant of distraint and levy illegal [3, 5]. These orders did not resolve the main questions raised in the petition, such as the correctness of the assessment, the necessity for recomputation, and the validity of the waiver of the statute of limitations [4, 5]. These substantive issues, including the defense of prescription, can only be decided after proper proceedings in the Tax Court and taken up in an appeal from the final decision [5]. Consequently, the appeal was deemed premature.
