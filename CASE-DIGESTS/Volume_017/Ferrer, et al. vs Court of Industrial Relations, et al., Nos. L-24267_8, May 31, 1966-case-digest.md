I. CAPTION
PERFECTO FERRER, ET AL. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-24267–8, May 31, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Inhelder Laboratories, Inc. & Sister Companies Employees Union (Union) submitted demands for a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to the Management, including a union shop clause [1, 2]. Negotiations ensued, leading to a draft (Exhibit D) initialed by both parties [2]. However, the Union refused to sign the final agreement on June 1, 1963, because it did not include the union shop clause [3, 4]. The Management subsequently issued a memorandum bypassing Union officers, leading to member resignations, and suspended or transferred several Union members [5-7].

Believing these acts constituted unfair labor practice (ULP) and bad faith, the Union filed a 30-day notice of strike on June 13, 1963, and another notice on June 25, 1963 [7, 8]. They staged a strike from July 1 to July 15, 1963, before the expiration of the 30-day period [7]. The CIR Trial Judge dismissed the ULP charges but justified the strike [9]. The CIR *en banc* reversed this, ruling the strike illegal for failure to observe the 30-day cooling-off period and declared the strikers had lost their employment status [3, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the strike was illegal due to the Union's failure to wait for the expiration of the 30-day notice period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the strike was legal. Although the Management may have had the legal right to discipline employees, the timing of the suspensions and transfers justified the Union's **good faith belief** that the Management was committing unfair labor practices to discourage Union membership and discredit its officers [10].

The Court established that a strike called to offset what petitioners were warranted in believing in good faith to be unfair labor practices is not illegal, and petitioners were not bound to wait for the expiration of thirty (30) days from the notice of strike before staging the same [11]. Consequently, the strikers did not lose their employment status [11]. However, since the Management was ultimately absolved of the actual ULP charges, the reinstatement of the strikers was ordered **without backpay** [11]. The Resolution of the CIR *en banc* was modified accordingly [12].
