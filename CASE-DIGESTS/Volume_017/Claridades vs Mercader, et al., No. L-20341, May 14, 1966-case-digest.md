I. CAPTION
DR. SIMEON S. CLARIDADES v. VICENTE C. MERCADER and PERFECTO FERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-20341, May 14, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Dr. Simeon Claridades filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bulacan against respondents Mercader and Fernandez for the dissolution of their partnership and an accounting of its operation. The partnership's main asset was a fishpond located in Marinduque. The defendants admitted the partnership's existence and did not object to the venue. Later, spouses Alfredo and Yap Zulueta were allowed to intervene, claiming ownership of the fishpond. The intervenors filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the case, ruling that because the plaintiff prayed for the sale of the partnership assets (including the fishpond), the action was a real action that should have been filed in Marinduque where the property was located. Claridades appealed the dismissal.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for dissolution of a partnership was correctly dismissed for improper venue because the partnership's real property was located in a different province.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. The Court ruled that a complaint seeking the liquidation of a partnership is a **personal action** which may be brought in the place of residence of either the plaintiff or the defendants under Rule 4, Section 2(c) of the Rules of Court. Since the plaintiff is a resident of Bulacan, venue was properly laid in that province.

The Court held that the fact that the plaintiff prayed for the sale of the fishpond did not change the nature of the action to a real action, as such sale is merely a necessary incident to the liquidation and dissolution of the partnership. Furthermore, the original defendants failed to object to the venue, which constitutes a **waiver** of their right to question it (Rule 4, Section 4; *Manila Railroad vs. Attorney General*). Finally, the Court applied the doctrine that an intervention cannot alter the nature of the action or the issues joined by the original parties (*Castro vs. David*); thus, the intervenors could not divest the court of the jurisdiction it had already legally acquired.

The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings.
