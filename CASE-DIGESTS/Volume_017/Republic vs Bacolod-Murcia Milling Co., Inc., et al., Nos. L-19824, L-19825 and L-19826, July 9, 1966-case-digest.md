I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC., MA-AO SUGAR CENTRAL CO., INC., and TALISAY-SILAY MILLING COMPANY, G.R. Nos. L-19824, L-19825 & L-19826, July 9, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Appellants (three sister sugar milling companies) were assessed a levy of PhP 0.10 per picul of sugar produced for five crop years (1951-1956) under Section 15 of Republic Act No. 632, the charter of the Philippine Sugar Institute (Philsugin) [1-3]. The proceeds formed the "Sugar Research and Stabilization Fund" [4]. In 1951, Philsugin purchased the Insular Sugar Refinery using these funds, but the refinery’s subsequent operations resulted in tremendous financial losses [5].

Appellants paid a portion of the levy but refused to pay the balance, arguing that: (1) Philsugin was not authorized by its charter to purchase a sugar refinery; and (2) the levy was a "special assessment" which implies that the property owners must derive a special benefit, a condition not met due to the refinery’s disastrous mismanagement and losses [6, 7]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of the Republic, ordering appellants to pay the unpaid balance [1, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Philsugin was authorized under RA 632 to purchase the Insular Sugar Refinery.
2. W/N the levy under RA 632 is a special assessment which appellants may refuse to pay due to lack of benefit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Philsugin is authorized to purchase the refinery. Section 3(d) of RA 632 explicitly empowers the corporation to purchase machineries, equipment, and materials for the production, manufacture, and handling of sugar [8]. Furthermore, Section 2(a) mandates Philsugin to conduct research in "all its phases," including industrial aspects, to reduce production costs [9]. The Court held that the operation of a refinery is a valid means to experiment on production processes and acquire industry know-how, making the purchase necessary to carry out the law's objectives [10].

2. **NO.** The levy is an exercise of **police power**, not a special assessment. Citing *Lutz v. Araneta* (98 Phil. 148), the Court ruled that the stabilization of the sugar industry is a matter of public concern and general welfare, not just for the benefit of the sugar producers [11, 12]. Therefore, the levy is an exercise of sovereign power which no private citizen may lawfully resist [13]. The Court further noted that even if the refinery lost money, the industry still benefited from the experience and management lessons gained, rejecting the claim that no benefit accrued to the appellants [9].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [14]. Justice Makalintal took no part [14].
