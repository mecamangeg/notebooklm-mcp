I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. COSME GO TIAN AN alias ANA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19833, August 31, 1966, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On November 13, 1958, petitioner Cosme Go Tian An *alias* Ana filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [1]. The petition was granted on August 12, 1959. After the two-year probationary period required by Republic Act 530, the CFI issued an order on September 18, 1961 allowing the petitioner to take his oath of allegiance, which he did on the same day, receiving his certificate of naturalization [1].

On November 7, 1961, the Provincial Fiscal filed a motion for reconsideration to cancel the certificate, arguing the petitioner illegally used alias names in violation of the Anti-Alias Law (Commonwealth Act 142) [2]. The petitioner opposed, arguing *res judicata* and estoppel since the government failed to raise the issue earlier [2, 3]. The CFI denied the Fiscal's motion, ruling the objection was too late and the petitioner's acts did not violate the law [4]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government is estopped from questioning the petitioner's citizenship or seeking the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of various names without judicial authority warrants the cancellation of his naturalization certificate.
3. W/N the petitioner proved he had lucrative employment.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The doctrine of estoppel or laches does not apply when the Government sues as Sovereign or asserts governmental rights, nor can it validate acts contravening law or public policy [3]. Furthermore, a naturalization proceeding is not a judicial adversary proceeding; the decision therein is not *res judicata* as to any matter supporting a judgment cancelling a certificate on grounds of illegal or fraudulent procurement (*Republic v. Go*) [3].

2. **YES.** The record conclusively proved the petitioner used at least three names ("Cosme Go Tian An alias Ana", "Go Tian An", and "Cosme D. Go") without judicial authority, violating Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 142 [5, 6]. The petitioner failed to provide satisfactory evidence that he was baptized with the name "Cosme Go" or authorized to use the other names. His conduct in contravention of the law affects his character and fitness to become a Filipino citizen [5, 6].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's claim of lucrative employment as a purchasing agent was uncorroborated by any supporting payroll, time record, or income tax return, which should have been filed legally [6]. This bare assertion proved at best only a token compliance with legal requirements [6].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the certificate of naturalization issued to the petitioner-appellee is ordered CANCELLED [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [7]. Justice Regala took no part [7].
