I. CAPTION
CELESTINO E. ESUERTE, MARIA BITOY, HONORATO LUCERO, and ANATOLIO BARCENA v. HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS, in his capacity as Presiding Judge, Sala II, Court of First Instance of Davao, HON. SALVADOR R. MARIÑO, DELFIN JAMPAYAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21122, June 23, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 29, 1961, President Garcia extended *ad interim* appointments to petitioners Esuerte, Bitoy, Lucero, and Barcena as Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and Councilors, respectively, of Mawab, Davao [1]. Subsequently, on January 25, 1963, President Macapagal designated respondents Jampayas, et al. to the same positions [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for prohibition and *quo warranto* (Sp. Civ. Case No. 3950) in the Court of First Instance of Davao, presided by respondent Judge Abbas, asserting their rights to the offices [1]. Judge Abbas denied their motion for a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain respondents from assuming the offices [1, 2]. Petitioners filed this original petition for certiorari to question that denial [2]. Meanwhile, the trial court dismissed the main case, and on appeal to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-23301), the dismissal was affirmed on February 28, 1966, declaring petitioners' appointments as invalid "midnight appointments" [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for certiorari regarding the denial of the preliminary injunction has become moot.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the issue in the present action, which is merely an incident of the main case, has become moot and academic [4, 5]. In the decision for the main case, *Esuerte v. Jampayas* (G.R. No. L-23301), the Court already resolved the controversy by declaring petitioners' *ad interim* appointments as part of the "midnight appointments" prohibited under the doctrine laid down in *Aytona v. Castillo* (G.R. No. L-19313) [3]. Consequently, the designations of the respondents by President Macapagal were upheld, rendering the question of the preliminary injunction in this case moot [3].

Petition dismissed [6].
