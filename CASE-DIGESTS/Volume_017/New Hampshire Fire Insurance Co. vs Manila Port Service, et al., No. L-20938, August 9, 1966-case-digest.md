I. CAPTION
NEW HAMPSHIRE FIRE INSURANCE CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, et al. and EVERETT STEAMSHIP CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-20938, August 9, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Ilaya Trading Company consigned three bales of cotton shipped from New Orleans via the SS "Castleville," operated by Everett Steamship Corporation. The vessel arrived in Manila on July 22, 1960. On the same day, the consignee's broker filed a "Provisional Claim" with the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS), alleging that the packages were "short landed and/or bad order." The discharge of the cargo was completed on July 23, 1960.

The parties stipulated that the shipment was actually discharged complete and in good order by the vessel into the custody of MPS. However, one bale was subsequently lost while in the possession of MPS. New Hampshire Fire Insurance Co., having paid the insurance claim to the consignee, sought reimbursement from MPS. The Court of First Instance dismissed the action, ruling that the provisional claim was speculative and did not comply with the Management Contract.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed before the discharge of the last package and without actual knowledge of loss complies with the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. Paragraph 15 of the Management Contract requires a claim to be filed *after* the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel to allow the consignee to examine the shipment [1].

While a provisional claim filed before the last discharge may be valid if the consignee already has knowledge of a shortage or damage (citing *Switzerland General Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Java Pacific & Hoegh Lines*), this exception does not apply to the present case [1]. The claim here was "speculative" because it was filed before the discharge was complete and alleged "short landing" (which implies vessel liability), whereas the stipulated facts showed the goods were landed in good order and the loss occurred later while in MPS custody [2]. Since the claim was filed without factual basis or actual knowledge of the loss, it did not bind the arrastre operator.

Judgment affirmed [3].
