I. CAPTION
PASTOR B. TENCHAVEZ v. VICENTA F. ESCAÑO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19671, July 26, 1966, 17 SCRA 674, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Pastor Tenchavez and Vicenta Escaño were married in the Philippines in 1948 [1]. Vicenta subsequently left her husband, went to the United States, obtained a divorce in Nevada in 1950, and married an American, Russell Leo Moran, in 1954 [2]. Pastor filed a suit for legal separation and damages. Vicenta objected to the jurisdiction of the Philippine court over her person as a non-resident but filed an answer with a counterclaim seeking damages against Pastor [3], [4]. The lower court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Supreme Court granted legal separation and awarded damages to Pastor. Vicenta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that her foreign divorce should be recognized, that moral damages cannot be awarded for refusal of consortium, and that the court lacked jurisdiction [5], [6], [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the foreign divorce decree obtained by the Filipino wife is valid and recognized in the Philippines.
2. W/N the wife is liable for moral damages for refusal to perform wifely duties and desertion.
3. W/N the Philippine court has jurisdiction over the non-resident wife.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The public policy of the Philippines is adverse to the recognition of the wife’s divorce obtained in Nevada [8]. Under private international law, foreign decrees cannot be enforced or recognized if they contravene the public policy of the forum [9]. A judgment affecting personal status is valid everywhere unless contrary to the policy of the country's own law [10].

2. **YES.** While courts cannot physically compel a spouse to cohabit (*Arroyo v. Arroyo*), economic sanctions are not incompatible with individual liberty [11], [12]. Vicenta’s acts—denial of consortium, desertion, and obtaining a divorce on grounds not countenanced by Philippine law—constitute a willful infliction of injury upon the husband’s feelings in a manner "contrary to morals, good customs or public policy" (Article 21, Civil Code) [13], [14]. This justifies an award of moral damages under Article 2219(10) of the Civil Code [6].

3. **YES.** First, in actions affecting personal status such as legal separation, the court has jurisdiction over the *res* (the status of the plaintiff domiciled in the Philippines), making jurisdiction over the person of the non-resident defendant non-essential [15], [16]. Second, by filing a counterclaim and asking for affirmative relief, Vicenta submitted to the jurisdiction of the court [17]. A party cannot adopt contradictory positions by invoking jurisdiction to claim damages while simultaneously denying it to avoid judgment [18], [19].

The Motions for Reconsideration were **DENIED** [20].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [20].
