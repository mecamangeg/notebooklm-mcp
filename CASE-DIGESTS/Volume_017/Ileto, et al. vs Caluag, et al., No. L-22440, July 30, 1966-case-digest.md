I. CAPTION
FLORANTE ILETO, ET AL. v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22440, July 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
J.M. Tuason & Co. secured a final judgment in Civil Case No. Q-4033 against Onofre Villacorte for the recovery of possession of a parcel of land in the Tatalon Estate. A writ of execution and motion for demolition followed [1]. Florante Ileto, claiming rights under a "without prejudice" clause from a previous Supreme Court decision involving the same parties, filed Civil Case No. 6714 for specific performance and/or reconveyance against J.M. Tuason & Co. in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [2].

Ileto then filed this petition for prohibition to stop Judge Caluag and the sheriff from executing the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-4033. Petitioners argued that the execution would render any favorable judgment in their pending case (Civil Case No. 6714) nugatory [2]. However, records showed that the CFI had already dismissed Civil Case No. 6714 on February 3, 1964 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition should be granted given the dismissal of the related case (Civil Case No. 6714).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the basis for the action had disappeared. The petition was anchored entirely on the pendency of Civil Case No. 6714. Since that case was dismissed on February 3, 1964, and there was no showing that the order of dismissal had been reversed on appeal or set aside, the relief sought became moot [3].

Petition denied [4], [3].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [5].
