I. CAPTION
CESARIO V. INDUCIL v. VICTOR DE LOS SANTOS, G.R. No. L-21060, May 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On October 12, 1956, petitioner Cesario Inducil (repairer) and respondent Victor de los Santos (proprietor) entered into a contract of services for a period of three years. Inducil agreed to repair De los Santos' buses for a stipulated monthly fee, which increased to P400 per month after the third month. The contract included a penal clause of P500 as liquidated damages. De los Santos paid the fees until April 1957 but stopped thereafter, alleging unsatisfactory service and insisting on paying on a piece-work basis starting May 1957. Inducil filed a suit for specific performance. The Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled in favor of Inducil, ordering De los Santos to comply with the contract and pay the monthly fees "up to the date of said judgment." On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, reasoning that the CFI's silence regarding the remaining term of the contract amounted to a rescission. Consequently, the CA applied Article 1721 of the Civil Code and limited De los Santos' liability to the P500 penal sum pursuant to Article 1226.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in treating the judgment as a rescission and limiting the award to the penal clause amount.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals erred. The petitioner's suit was clearly for specific performance, which the trial court granted. The trial court's failure to make a pronouncement regarding the rights of the parties after the date of judgment did not amount to a rescission; rather, the existing contract continued to govern their future relations [1, 2]. Since there was no rescission, the CA incorrectly applied Article 1721 (regarding defects in piece-work) and Article 1226 (penalty clause as substitute for damages) to limit the respondent's liability [2]. Furthermore, the award of attorney's fees was proper because the respondent acted in bad faith by refusing a plainly valid claim (Art. 2208, Civil Code) [3].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The respondent is ordered to comply with the contract by paying the monthly compensation of P400 from May 1, 1957, up to the contract's expiration on October 31, 1959, plus interest and attorney's fees.
