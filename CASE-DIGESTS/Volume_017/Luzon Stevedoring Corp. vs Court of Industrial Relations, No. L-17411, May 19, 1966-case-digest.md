I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and LUSTEVECO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION-CCLU (and vice versa), G.R. Nos. L-17411, L-18681, & L-18683, May 19, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Lusteveco Employees Association (LEA) staged a strike against Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (LUZON). On June 2, 1959, LEA offered to return 300 workers to work "under the status quo as directed by the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in its order of June 21, 1958." This CIR order included a provision for the payment of strike-duration pay. LUZON refused to accept the offer, citing pending litigation regarding the legality of the strike. LEA contended that this refusal constituted an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), thereby converting the economic strike into a lawful ULP strike. LEA also questioned the reduction of the 1958 Christmas bonus. The CIR ruled against the union, declaring the strike illegal and authorizing the dismissal of active unionists. LEA filed a Motion for Reconsideration.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N LUZON's refusal to accept the strikers' offer to return to work converted the strike into a ULP strike.
2. W/N the strike may be declared illegal despite the strikers' good faith.
3. W/N the reduction of the 1958 Christmas bonus was unjustified.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that LEA's offer to return to work was not unconditional. The offer expressly stipulated that the return would be "as directed by the CIR," which included the "payment of strike-duration pay." Since the offer imposed a condition (strike-duration pay), LEA cannot invoke the doctrine in *Consolidated Labor Association of the Philippines v. Marsman & Co., Inc.* that the refusal to accept an *unconditional* offer constitutes ULP [1-3].

2. **YES.** Citing *Interwood Employees Association v. International Hardwood and Veneer Co.*, the Court ruled that if strikers act from an unlawful, illegitimate, unjust, or unreasonable ground, the strike may be declared illegal notwithstanding their good faith. Consequently, the dismissal of union members was proper, as they were dismissed not for union activity but for participation in an illegal strike [4-7].

3. **NO.** The Court found that the Christmas bonus was not included in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). While the CBA contained a clause to "maintain... all concessions," it included the proviso "whenever practicable." Furthermore, the CBA expired in September 1958, and the bonus in question was for December 1958, three months later [8].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED** [9].
