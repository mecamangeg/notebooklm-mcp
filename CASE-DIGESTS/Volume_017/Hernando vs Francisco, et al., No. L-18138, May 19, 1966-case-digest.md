I. CAPTION
HONORIO J. HERNANDO v. J. FRANCISCO, Commodore, PN, Flag Officer in Command Philippine Navy, HON. ALEJO SANTOS, Secretary of National Defense, and HON. PEDRO GIMENEZ, Auditor General, G.R. No. L-18138, May 19, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Honorio J. Hernando, a lighthouse keeper at Cape Bojeador, faced administrative charges filed by private individuals. Upon request of the Superintendent of the Lighthouse Service, the Provincial Auditor of Ilocos Norte conducted an investigation. Following the Auditor's report, Petitioner was suspended. He subsequently filed a petition for reinstatement with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte, claiming denial of due process and lack of authority of the Provincial Auditor to investigate. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Petitioner was estopped by a sworn statement wherein he expressed willingness to be separated from service if criminal charges were quashed, and that under Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code, the Commissioner of Civil Service had exclusive jurisdiction over the case. Petitioner appealed, arguing that only the Commissioner of Civil Service has the power to conduct formal administrative investigations and that this power cannot be delegated to a Provincial Auditor.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioner of Civil Service has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct formal administrative investigations against subordinate officers.
2. W/N the head of an office can validly delegate the authority to investigate to a Provincial Auditor.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code grants the Commissioner of Civil Service exclusive jurisdiction over the removal and separation of employees, Executive Order No. 370 allows the head of a bureau or office to commence administrative proceedings and conduct investigations. The Commissioner only takes cognizance of the case after the investigation is finished and the records are forwarded. Furthermore, Republic Act No. 2260 changed the jurisdiction of the Commissioner from "exclusive" to "final," and procedural laws contain no vested rights.

2. **YES.** The authority of a bureau head to investigate subordinate employees can be delegated. The Superintendent of the Lighthouse Service validly designated the Provincial Auditor as his authorized representative to conduct the investigation. Since Petitioner submitted himself to the investigation without objection, he is deemed to have waived any formal imperfections. The Court held that due process in the strict judicial sense is not indispensable in administrative proceedings (*Cornejo v. Gabriel*).

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
