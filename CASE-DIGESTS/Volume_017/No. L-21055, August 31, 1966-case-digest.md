I. CAPTION
**CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-21055, August 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Caltex (Philippines), Inc. was the consignee of various lubricating products discharged into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator, from the vessel "SS Ferndale." Thirty-three (33) pieces of the shipment, consisting of drums, a crate, and pails, were not delivered. Caltex filed a provisional claim and subsequently sued MPS and the Manila Railroad Company in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for the value of the missing goods plus the 25% marginal fee paid on the importation. The CFI ruled in favor of Caltex, ordering the defendants to pay P8,028.60. The defendants appealed, arguing that under Section 15 of the Management Contract, their liability should be limited to P500.00, and that they should not be liable for the marginal fee. They also disputed the currency conversion rate used.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the arrastre operator's liability should be limited to P500.00 for the entire lost shipment under the Management Contract.
2. W/N the arrastre operator is liable for the marginal fee paid by the consignee.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The limit applies per package, not for the entire shipment. Under Section 15 of the Management Contract, liability is limited to P500.00 "per package" unless a higher value is specified. The term "package" includes containers such as drums, crates, or bales. Since 33 packages were lost, the aggregate liability limit would be P16,500.00 (33 x P500). Because the actual invoice value claimed by Caltex was lower than this aggregate limit, the P500 limitation does not serve to reduce the defendants' liability; they must pay the full actual value of the lost goods [1], [2].

2. **YES.** Section 15 of the Management Contract holds the arrastre operator responsible not only for the invoice value but also for "all damages that may be suffered on account of loss." The 25% marginal fee paid by Caltex on the foreign exchange used for the importation constitutes actual damages lost due to the non-delivery of the goods. Therefore, it is recoverable from the defendants [3].

However, the Supreme Court found the lower court applied an incorrect exchange rate. Using the correct rate of P2.015 per dollar, the total award was reduced.

**Decision MODIFIED.** Defendants are ordered to pay P3,568.86 (value of goods) plus P892.22 (marginal fee), totaling P4,461.08, with legal interest [4], [5].
