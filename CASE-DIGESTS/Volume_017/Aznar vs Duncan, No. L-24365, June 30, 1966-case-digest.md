I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF EDWARD E. CHRISTENSEN, DECEASED. ADOLFO C. AZNAR v. MARIA LUCY CHRISTENSEN DUNCAN, G.R. No. L-24365, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Edward E. Christensen, a California citizen domiciled in the Philippines, died leaving a will executed in 1951 [1]. In his will, he declared Maria Lucy Christensen Duncan (Lucy) as his only child and instituted her as his heir [2]. He expressly denied being related to Maria Helen Christensen Garcia (Helen), but bequeathed her a legacy of P3,600.00 [2]. Subsequent to his death, Helen was judicially declared his natural child [1]. The trial court (CFI Davao) approved a project of partition dividing the estate equally between Lucy and Helen, ruling that Helen had been preterited (omitted) from the will, which annulled the institution of Lucy as heir and resulted in intestacy [3], [4]. Lucy appealed, arguing that since Helen received a legacy, there was no preterition, and Helen was entitled only to the completion of her legitime [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the institution of the heir is annulled by preterition when a compulsory heir is denied recognition in the will but is nonetheless given a specific legacy.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that there was no preterition. Preterition, under Article 854 of the Civil Code, is the omission of the heir in the will, either by not naming him at all or by not instituting him as heir nor assigning him any part of the estate [6]. Here, the testator did not entirely omit Helen; he left her a legacy of P3,600.00 [7].

The Court applied Article 906 of the Civil Code, which provides that a compulsory heir to whom the testator has left "by any title" less than the legitime may demand that the same be fully satisfied [5]. Since Helen received a legacy, the institution of Lucy as heir is not annulled; rather, Helen is merely entitled to the completion of her legitime [8]. Consequently, Helen is entitled to only one-fourth (1/4) of the hereditary estate as her legitime, not an equal share under intestacy [9].

The order of the trial court was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** with instructions to partition the estate by giving Helen Garcia no more than the portion corresponding to her legitime [9].
