I. CAPTION
PANTALEON S. SARMENTA v. MARIO S. GARCIA, City Mayor, and PRIMO FERRER, City Treasurer of Cabanatuan, G.R. No. L-17296, July 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 24, 1960, petitioner Pantaleon Sarmenta, a member of the Municipal Board of Cabanatuan City, filed a special civil action for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija against respondents City Mayor Mario Garcia and City Treasurer Primo Ferrer [1]. Sarmenta sought to compel the respondents to submit a detailed budget for the fiscal year 1960-1961 to the Municipal Board [2]. The respondents filed motions to dismiss, arguing, among others, that the act was discretionary and that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies [3]. The lower court dismissed the petition, ruling that the petitioner could have appealed to the Secretary of Finance, and that under Republic Act No. 2264, the Mayor had discretion to rely on the re-enacted budget of the previous year [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for mandamus should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the question raised—whether respondents should be required to submit a detailed budget for the fiscal year 1960-1961—had become moot and academic [4]. At the time the case was submitted for decision, the fiscal year involved was already about to end [4]. Furthermore, the City of Cabanatuan was not left without a budget but had operated on the budget for the preceding fiscal year, 1959-1960 [4]. The Court held that resolving the issue would not result in any substantial benefit or advantage to either party [4].

Accordingly, the case was ordered dismissed [5].
