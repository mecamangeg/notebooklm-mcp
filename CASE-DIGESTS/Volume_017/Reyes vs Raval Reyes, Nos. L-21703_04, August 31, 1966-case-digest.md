I. CAPTION
MATEO H. REYES and JUAN H. REYES v. MATEO RAVAL REYES, G.R. Nos. L-21703–04, August 31, 1966, 17 SCRA 1099, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Mateo H. and Juan H. Reyes, the registered owners of lots covered by Original Certificates of Title (OCT) Nos. 22161 and 8066, filed a motion in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte (Cadastral Cases Nos. 31 and 42) to compel respondent Mateo Raval Reyes to surrender the owner's duplicates of said titles [1, 2]. Respondent opposed the motion, alleging he had purchased an undivided one-third share of the lots from the petitioners' brother, Francisco H. Reyes, and was thus a co-owner entitled to possession [2].

Prior to this motion, petitioners had filed Civil Case No. 3659 against respondent for recovery of products and damages. In that civil case, respondent filed a counterclaim for partition based on his alleged co-ownership [3, 4]. The lower court denied the petitioners' motion to surrender the titles, ruling that the lots were subjects of litigation in the pending Civil Case No. 3659 and the issue of ownership had not yet been decided [5]. Petitioners appealed on a pure question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent may withhold possession of the owner's duplicate certificates of title from the registered owners on the ground of a pending counterclaim for partition involving the property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the owner of the land, in whose favor and name the land is registered, has a preferential right to the possession of the owner's duplicate title over one whose name does not appear in the certificate and who has yet to establish his right to possession [6].

The Court relied on *El Director de Terrenos contra Abacahin* (72 Phil. 326), which established that a co-heir or alleged co-owner must exercise an independent action to obtain their share, but the registered owner is entitled to custody of the certificate [7, 8]. The Court emphasized that the respondent's rights were already amply protected by his counterclaim for partition in the civil case and his ability to file a notice of *lis pendens* under Section 24, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court to record the litigation [9]. There was no valid reason to withhold the titles from the registered owners [6].

The orders appealed from are REVERSED, and respondent is ordered to deliver the owner's duplicates of OCT Nos. 22161 and 8066 to petitioners [10, 11].
