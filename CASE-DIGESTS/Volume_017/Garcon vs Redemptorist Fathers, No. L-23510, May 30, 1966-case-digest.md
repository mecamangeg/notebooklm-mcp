I. CAPTION
LUCIDO GARCON v. REDEMPTORIST FATHERS, G.R. No. L-23510, May 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 3, 1963, Petitioner Lucido Garcon filed a complaint against Respondent Redemptorist Fathers, a religious corporation, for unpaid salaries, overtime pay, and termination pay. Garcon alleged that he was employed as a chief cook in a dormitory maintained by the Respondent for profit and was summarily dismissed without notice. The Respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no valid cause of action. Respondent argued that as a religious order maintaining a non-profit minor seminary, it was not an industrial or commercial establishment covered by the Termination Pay Law (R.A. No. 1052) or the Eight-Hour Labor Law (C.A. No. 444). The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint, accepting the Respondent’s defense that it was not an employer under the purview of said laws. Garcon appealed, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court on a pure question of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action based on the Respondent's allegations in the Motion to Dismiss.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal. The Court ruled that in a motion to dismiss based on lack of cause of action, the question is the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint itself, which must be hypothetically admitted as true. The sufficiency must be determined solely from the face of the complaint, and the court may not inquire into the truth of the allegations or consider matters of defense prior to a hearing on the merits.

The trial court erred by accepting the Respondent's allegation (that it was a non-profit seminary) which contradicted the Petitioner's complaint (that it was a dormitory for profit). Based solely on the complaint, the Petitioner pleaded facts sufficient to fall under the labor laws. Furthermore, even if the Petitioner were considered a domestic helper as argued by the Respondent, the complaint still stated a valid cause of action under the Civil Code, specifically Articles 1695 and 1698, which entitle domestics to vacation leave and advance notice of dismissal.

The Order of dismissal is set aside, and the case is remanded to the court of origin with directions to overrule the motion to dismiss.
