I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AURELIO BALISACAN, G.R. No. L-26376, August 31, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On February 1, 1965, Aurelio Balisacan was charged with homicide in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte for stabbing Leonicio Bulaoat [1, 2]. Upon arraignment, Balisacan entered a plea of guilty but was allowed to present evidence to prove mitigating circumstances [2]. During his testimony, he claimed he stabbed the deceased in self-defense because the latter was strangling him [3]. Relying solely on this testimony, the trial court acquitted Balisacan on March 6, 1965 [3]. The prosecution appealed the decision. The appeal was certified to the Supreme Court as it involved purely questions of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in acquitting the accused based on his testimony after a plea of guilty.
2. W/N the prosecution's appeal places the accused in double jeopardy.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A plea of guilty is an unconditional admission of guilt which forecloses the right to defend oneself; however, Balisacan's testimony that he acted in complete self-defense effectively vacated his plea of guilty [4, 5]. The trial court should have required him to plead anew or directed a new plea of not guilty be entered for him, and then proceeded with the trial in the order set forth in Section 3 of Rule 119 of the Rules of Court [5, 6]. By deciding the case on the merits without a requisite trial and denying the prosecution the opportunity to present evidence or rebut the testimony, the court acted without due process of law [7, 8].

2. **NO.** The existence of a valid plea is an essential requisite for double jeopardy [5]. Since Balisacan's testimony vacated his guilty plea and no new plea was entered, there was no standing plea at the time the court rendered its judgment [5]. Furthermore, because the trial court acted without due process, the judgment of acquittal is null and void; a void judgment is no acquittal at all and cannot constitute a proper basis for a claim of former jeopardy [8].

**Judgment set aside; case remanded to lower court for further proceedings.**
