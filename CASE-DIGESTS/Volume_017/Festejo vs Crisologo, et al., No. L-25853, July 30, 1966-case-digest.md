I. CAPTION
PABLO FESTEJO v. CARMEN P. CRISOLOGO, as Governor of Ilocos Sur, THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF ILOCOS SUR and BRIGIDO VILOG, as Vice-Mayor of Sta. Lucia, Ilocos Sur, G.R. No. L-25853, July 30, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pablo Festejo, the Municipal Mayor of Sta. Lucia, Ilocos Sur, was suspended by respondent Governor Carmen Crisologo on March 14, 1966. This suspension was based on a second administrative complaint charging him with neglect of duty, corruption, dishonesty, and grave abuse of authority for allegedly misappropriating P5,000.00 of public funds (proceeds from a popularity contest). Petitioner filed a petition for prohibition, arguing that since the charges against him constitute a crime involving moral turpitude (Estafa), no administrative action could be taken against him until a final judgment of conviction is rendered by a court. He contended that the Governor acted in excess of authority by suspending him prior to such conviction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a municipal mayor charged with acts constituting a crime involving moral turpitude may be administratively suspended by the Provincial Governor prior to a final judgment of conviction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code, the grounds for disciplining municipal officers fall into two categories: (1) those related to the discharge of official functions (neglect of duty, oppression, corruption, or maladministration); and (2) those not connected with said functions (commission of any crime involving moral turpitude).

The Court held that conviction by final judgment is a condition precedent for administrative action *only* for the second category—where the crime involving moral turpitude is **not** linked with the performance of official duties. However, acts constituting maladministration or corruption are necessarily connected with the office. Therefore, they may be the object of administrative action even if no crime has been committed yet, or even if the act constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude. It would be absurd to deny the power to suspend merely because the official's misconduct is serious enough to constitute a crime. All that is required for suspension under Section 2188 is that the charge, in the Governor's opinion, affects the official integrity of the officer. The charge of misappropriation of public funds clearly affects official integrity.

Petition dismissed.
