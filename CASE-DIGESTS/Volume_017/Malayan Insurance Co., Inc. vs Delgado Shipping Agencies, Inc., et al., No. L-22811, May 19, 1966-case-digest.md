I. CAPTION
MALAYAN INSURANCE CO., INC. v. DELGADO SHIPPING AGENCIES, INC., representing the BEN LINE STEAMERS, LTD., and/or MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, No. L-22811, May 19, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. insured goods shipped to Ramie Textiles Mills, Inc. Upon delivery, a shortage was discovered. Plaintiff paid the consignee and, as subrogee, filed a collection suit against Delgado Shipping Agencies, Inc. (Carrier) and the Arrastre operators on February 11, 1963. The original complaint alleged the goods were discharged on February 9, 1962. The Carrier moved to dismiss on the ground of prescription under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), claiming the one-year period had lapsed. The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice. Plaintiff moved to reconsider and amend the complaint, asserting the date "February 9" was a clerical error and the actual discharge date was February 10, 1962, as shown by Tally Sheets. Since February 10, 1963 was a Sunday, filing on February 11 would be timely. The trial court denied the amendment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the admission of the amended complaint to correct the alleged date of discharge.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that prescription does not justify the denial of permission to amend a complaint if the theory of prescription is based upon an erroneous allegation of fact that the plaintiff seeks to rectify. Under Rule 1, Section 2 and Rule 135, Section 5(g) of the Rules of Court, procedural rules must be liberally construed to make proceedings conformable to law and justice.

Since the dismissal was "without prejudice," the plaintiff could legally file a new action alleging the correct date. Therefore, allowing the amendment avoids multiplicity of suits and permits the determination of rights based on objective facts rather than technicalities. The Court also noted that documentary evidence (Tally Sheets) carried more weight than the affidavit of merit required by the lower court.

Order set aside. Case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.
