I. CAPTION
FILEMON YEPES and MATEO SUSAYA v. SAMAR EXPRESS TRANSIT, G.R. Nos. L-19815–16, May 19, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 23, 1959, plaintiffs Filemon Yepes and Mateo Susaya were passengers on Bus No. 56 of Samar Express Transit when it turned turtle and caught fire while traveling from Borongan to Dolores, Samar. The plaintiffs suffered serious burns and were hospitalized. The bus operator, represented by Pedro Ty Belizar, paid for their medical expenses. Before being transferred to the Leyte Provincial Hospital, the plaintiffs signed a document stating that in consideration of the expenses incurred by the operator for their treatment, they "manifest our desire to waive any and all claims against the operator."

Despite this document, plaintiffs filed separate complaints for breach of contract of carriage against the operator. The Court of First Instance of Samar ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the waiver null and void as contrary to public policy, and awarded damages. The operator appealed, contending solely that the lower court erred in declaring the waiver void.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the document signed by the plaintiffs constitutes a valid waiver of their right to claim damages.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, holding that the plaintiffs did not actually waive their right to claim damages. The Court observed that the document merely expressed a "desire" to make a waiver, which is distinct from making an actual waiver of a right. Relying on the Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of July 8, 1887, the Court established that a waiver must be "clear and unequivocal" to be valid, which was not the case here [1]. Because the Court found there was no actual waiver, it deemed it unnecessary to resolve whether such a waiver would have been contrary to public policy [2]. The decision of the lower court awarding damages was affirmed [2].
