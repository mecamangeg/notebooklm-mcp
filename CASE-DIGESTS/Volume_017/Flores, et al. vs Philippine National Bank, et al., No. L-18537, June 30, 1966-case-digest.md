I. CAPTION
DOMINGO FLORES, ET AL. v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK and ONOFRE P. GUEVARA, G.R. No. L-18537, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, comprising 49 claimants, engaged respondent Atty. Onofre P. Guevara to file a petition against Philippine National Bank (PNB) for the payment of additional compensation [1, 2]. The legal services agreement stipulated a contingent fee of 20% of whatever amount the petitioners could obtain [3, 4]. Atty. Guevara instituted the claims in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in December 1957 [5]. During the pendency of the case, negotiations for an amicable settlement ensued, leading to the withdrawal of the claims to facilitate the settlement [2].

Almost a year after the withdrawal, petitioners grew impatient with the lack of results and wrote Atty. Guevara, giving him 30 days to report on the progress. Atty. Guevara failed to answer the letter. Upon the expiration of the 30-day period, petitioners terminated his services and engaged a new counsel, Atty. Leon O. Ty [2, 6]. Atty. Ty finalized the negotiations, and PNB approved claims totaling P88,125.86. Atty. Ty received 10% of this amount for his services [4, 6]. The CIR, however, issued an order awarding Atty. Guevara the full 20% contingent fee originally agreed upon. Petitioners appealed this order to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Guevara is entitled to the full 20% contingent fee despite being discharged before the settlement was finalized.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court modified the CIR order, ruling that Atty. Guevara is not entitled to the full 20% under his contract because he was discharged before the agreed services could be rendered in full [4]. The Court noted that Atty. Guevara did not question the reasonableness of the ground for his discharge [4].

Since the petitioners were originally willing to set aside 20% for legal fees, and the new counsel (Atty. Ty) received 10%, the Court held that awarding Atty. Guevara 10% (matching the new counsel's fee) was fair and would not constitute an additional burden on the petitioners [4].

**Order modified.** Atty. Guevara's fees are fixed at 10% of P88,125.86 [7].
