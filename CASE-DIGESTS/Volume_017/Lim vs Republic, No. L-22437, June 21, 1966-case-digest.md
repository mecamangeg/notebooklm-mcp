I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. FRANCISCO LIM alias ELIS LIM v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22437, June 21, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Lim, born in El Nido, Palawan in 1939, applied for naturalization. He resided in El Nido until 1954, when he moved to Manila for his studies and subsequent employment. To support his petition, he presented two character witnesses, Vicente Rodriguez and Bernardo Dangan. However, Rodriguez had been a resident of Muntinglupa, Rizal since 1946, and Dangan resided there from 1950 to 1961. The witnesses claimed they maintained contact with Lim through occasional visits—once or twice a month—either in Manila or Muntinglupa. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the petition, questioning the credibility of the witnesses and their opportunity to observe the petitioner. Lim appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses were credible and qualified to vouch for the petitioner's conduct.
2. W/N the petitioner met the lucrative income requirement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the character witnesses were not credible because they resided in Muntinglupa, a place far from the petitioner's residences in El Nido and Manila, for a long period of time. Consequently, they lacked the sufficient background and basis to vouch for the petitioner's character or qualify as "insurers" of his good conduct [1, 2]. The Naturalization Law requires witnesses to have personal knowledge of the petitioner's conduct during the *entire period* of his residence in the Philippines [3]. The Court found that occasional meetings did not afford the witnesses ample opportunity to observe the petitioner, and their claims of frequent social visits were implausible given the wide age gap between them and the petitioner [4]. Furthermore, witness Dangan failed to correctly identify the petitioner's father, proving his knowledge of the petitioner was merely superficial [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed that naturalization proceedings involve public interest and are open to scrutiny [7]. It noted that the petitioner’s occupation, yielding an income of only P240.00 a month, was not considered lucrative [7, 8]. Commissions were excluded from this reckoning because they are contingent or speculative [8].

The appealed judgment is AFFIRMED.
