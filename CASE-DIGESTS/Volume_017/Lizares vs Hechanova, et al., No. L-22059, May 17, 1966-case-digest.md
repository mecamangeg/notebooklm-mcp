I. CAPTION
MARIO T. LIZARES v. RUFINO G. HECHANOVA, in his capacity as Executive Secretary and VALERIANO M. GATUSLAO, in his capacity as Provincial Governor of Occidental Negros, G.R. No. L-22059, May 17, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lizares, the Mayor of Talisay, Occidental Negros, was administratively charged on June 1, 1962, with corruption and maladministration regarding the disbursement of public funds for the improvement of the Talisay-Catabla Road, alleged to be private property [1]. The Provincial Board investigated the charge and acquitted the petitioner in July-August 1963 [1]. However, on appeal, respondent Executive Secretary Hechanova, by authority of the President, rendered a decision on October 22, 1963, revoking the Board's decision and suspending Lizares for one month [1]. Lizares filed a petition for certiorari claiming the Executive Secretary lacked the power to revoke the acquittal and questioning the constitutionality of the relevant Administrative Code provisions [1]. During the pendency of the case, it was undisputed that Lizares was re-elected for another term from January 1, 1964, to December 31, 1967 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner may be removed or suspended for administrative offenses committed during a previous term after being re-elected.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the re-election of a public officer operates as a condonation of previous misconduct, cutting off the right to remove him for acts committed during a prior term [2, 3]. Citing *Pascual v. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija*, the Court explained that each term is separate from other terms [3]. When the people elect a man to office, it is assumed they did so with knowledge of his life and character, disregarding or forgiving any prior fault; thus, the Court should not practically overrule the will of the people by removing him for such past misconduct [3]. Consequently, the petitioner is no longer amenable to administrative sanctions for acts committed during his former tenure, rendering the validity of the suspension merely theoretical [4].

The petition was **DISMISSED** for having become moot [4].
