I. CAPTION
RAFAEL MORALES v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16759, August 31, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rafael Morales submitted a deed of extrajudicial partition for his deceased wife’s estate on April 28, 1951, paying the tentative estate and inheritance taxes assessed by Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue. On May 14, 1956, Respondent issued a deficiency assessment for P1,272.99 [1, 2]. On October 15, 1956, Petitioner wrote to Respondent contending that the reassessment had prescribed as more than five years had elapsed since the 1951 submission. Respondent rejected this claim in a letter dated December 28, 1956, demanding payment [2, 3].

Petitioner failed to pay, leading Respondent to issue a warrant of distraint and levy on October 14, 1958. Petitioner requested the cancellation of the warrant, which Respondent denied on December 5, 1958 [3, 4]. On December 8, 1958, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), explicitly appealing the December 5, 1958 denial [4]. The CTA dismissed the petition *motu proprio*, ruling that the proper appealable decision was the letter of December 28, 1956, and thus the appeal was filed out of time [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the Respondent’s letter dated December 28, 1956, constituted the appealable decision on the "disputed assessment" under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 [5]. This letter had the "tenor of finality" because it rejected the Petitioner's claim of prescription and insisted on payment by a specific date, unequivocally denying the plea for cancellation [6].

The Court clarified that the subsequent letter of December 5, 1958, was not a decision on the assessment but merely addressed the manner of collection (distraint and levy), making the issue of prescription irrelevant to that specific denial [7]. Since Petitioner failed to appeal the December 28, 1956 decision within the statutory period, it became final and unappealable. Consequently, the validity of the assessment could no longer be reopened through an appeal from the denial of the request to cancel the warrant of distraint [8].

**The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.**
