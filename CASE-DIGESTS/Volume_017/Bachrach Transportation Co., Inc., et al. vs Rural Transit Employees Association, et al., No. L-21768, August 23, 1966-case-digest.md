I. CAPTION
THE BACHRACH TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. and THE BACHRACH MOTOR CO., INC. v. RURAL TRANSIT EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION and RURAL TRANSIT SHOP EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-21768, August 23, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1958, a labor dispute involving a strike at the Bachrach Motor Co. (doing business as "Rural Transit") was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) as Case No. 22-IPA [1]. During the proceedings, the Rural Transit Shop Employees Association (the Union) filed a motion to verify the money value of accrued leaves paid to employees from 1946, which the CIR granted [2].

While this verification was pending, the Company and the Union executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) on December 21, 1959 [3]. Clause XI of the CBA stipulated that all demands in the Union's letter of October 30, 1959, were withdrawn, and further stated that the agreement "settles all matters, questions and disputes between them, regardless of whether or not they are mentioned herein" [3].

Subsequently, the CIR examiner reported an underpayment of accrued leaves [4]. The Union moved for the deposit of the corresponding amount, but the Company opposed, arguing the claim had been waived under Clause XI of the CBA [5]. The CIR ruled in favor of the Union, holding that the waiver only applied to demands in the October 30 letter, which did not include the accrued leave claim [6, 7]. The Company appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Union's claim for accrued leave pay was waived by the general settlement clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR decision.

The Court held that while the first sentence of Clause XI referred specifically to the Union's letter of October 30, 1959, the second sentence—certifying that the agreement "settles all matters, questions and disputes between them, regardless of whether or not they are mentioned herein"—must be interpreted to cover pending disputes not mentioned in said letter [8, 9]. Interpreting the second sentence as merely referring to the letter again would make it a "useless duplication and a total superfluity" [9].

Under Section 9, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court, an instrument should be construed to give effect to all its provisions [10]. Since the claim for accrued leaves was a pending dispute when the CBA was signed, it was necessarily included in the waiver [10]. The Court further noted that the right to payment of accrued vacation leave is waivable (*Philippine Air Lines vs. Balanguit*, 99 Phil. 485) [11, 12]. Thus, the claim was validly renounced [13].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **REVERSED**, and the Union's claim is **DISMISSED**.
