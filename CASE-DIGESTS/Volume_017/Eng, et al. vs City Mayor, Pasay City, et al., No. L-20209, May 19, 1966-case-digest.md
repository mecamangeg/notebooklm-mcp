I. CAPTION
TAN TIONG ENG alias KUONG LEONG, ET AL. v. THE HON. CITY MAYOR, PASAY CITY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20209, May 19, 1966, Bengzon, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are Chinese citizens and veterans of World War II who claimed to be employed as laborers or helpers in the Pasay City Market [1]. In May 1962, the respondent City officials ordered them to stop working in the market, citing Republic Act No. 37, Department of Finance Circular No. 32, and Section 23 of Municipal Ordinance No. 33, series of 1948 [1, 2]. Section 23 specifically requires that helpers in the public market must be citizens of the Philippines or the United States [2].

Petitioners filed a complaint alleging that these laws were inapplicable to them and unconstitutional for being discriminatory and violative of due process [2, 3]. Thirty-two Filipino stallholders intervened, asserting that petitioners were not mere helpers but were, in fact, the capitalists financing the Filipino stallholders [4]. The Court of First Instance initially ruled for the petitioners but, after a new trial granted to the intervenors, dismissed the complaint [4, 5]. The trial court found that petitioners were indeed capitalists employing Filipinos who posed as stallholders [5]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved the constitutionality of the municipal ordinance [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 23 of Municipal Ordinance No. 33 prohibiting aliens from working as helpers in public markets is unconstitutional.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court upheld the validity of the ordinance and the city officials' actions. The Court cited Republic Act No. 37, which nationalizes public markets and restricts alien intervention therein [6]. The validity of this policy has been settled in *Co Chiong v. Cuaderno* and *De Salgado v. Fuente* [6].

Furthermore, the Court emphasized that under Republic Act No. 1180 (Retail Trade Nationalization Law), passed in 1954, the right to engage in retail trade is reserved for Filipino citizens [7]. Since market stallholders are retailers, petitioners cannot claim the right to operate stalls in the guise of laborers or salesmen [7]. The trial court's factual finding that petitioners were "in truth and in fact, the capitalists" of the Filipino stallholders was undisputed by petitioners [6]. Allowing them to continue would impede violations of the Anti-Dummy Law (Republic Act No. 134), as they would be enjoying the preference for Filipino stallholders despite being aliens [7].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [8].
