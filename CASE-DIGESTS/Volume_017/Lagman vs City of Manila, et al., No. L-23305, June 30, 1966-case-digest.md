I. CAPTION
BENEDICTO C. LAGMAN v. CITY OF MANILA, its officers and/or agents, G.R. No. L-23305, June 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Benedicto C. Lagman, doing business as "Marco Transit," held a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) from the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate 15 buses on the Bocaue-Parañaque line, which passes through the City of Manila [1]. On July 13, 1964, the Municipal Board of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 4986, which regulated the entry of "provincial passenger buses" into the city to relieve traffic congestion [2]. The ordinance restricted entry points and routes, and limited the number of shuttle buses allowed to operate within city limits [3, 4].

On August 17, 1964, the City Mayor enforced the ordinance, preventing Lagman from operating his buses on his authorized route, except for two shuttle buses [5]. Lagman filed a petition for prohibition, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional and *ultra vires* because: (1) the regulation of national roads is vested in the Director of Public Works under Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 548; (2) the modification of CPCs is the exclusive power of the PSC under the Public Service Act (CA No. 146); and (3) the ordinance was arbitrary and oppressive [5-7]. He further argued that his buses merely "pass thru" the city and are exempt under the saving clause of the Manila Charter [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City of Manila has the authority to enact Ordinance No. 4986 regulating provincial buses on national roads within the city, notwithstanding the powers of the Director of Public Works and the Public Service Commission.
2. W/N the ordinance is arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable.
3. W/N the petitioner is exempt from the ordinance under the "passing thru" clause of the Manila Charter.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Republic Act No. 409 (Revised Charter of the City of Manila) is a special law enacted later than the general laws CA No. 548 and CA No. 146 [9]. Under Section 18(hh) of RA 409, the City is expressly granted the legislative power to "prohibit and regulate the entrance of provincial utility vehicles into the city" [10]. In statutory construction, a special law prevails over a general law, and a later enactment prevails over an earlier one [9, 11]. Thus, the City's charter constitutes an exception to the powers of the Director of Public Works [11]. Furthermore, the PSC’s power to modify certificates under CA No. 146 is subordinate to the City’s authority to control its streets. Section 17(j) of the Public Service Act explicitly requires public services to comply with municipal ordinances [12-14].

2. **NO.** The implementation of the ordinance is not arbitrary or unreasonable. There is no evidence to substantiate the charge, and the petitioner was not totally banned but was allowed to operate "shuttle" buses within city limits [15].

3. **NO.** Petitioner cannot avail of the saving clause in Section 18(hh) of RA 409 for vehicles "passing thru the city." He admitted that his buses engage in business within city limits by picking up passengers therein; therefore, they do not merely pass through [16].

The petition for prohibition is **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [16].
