I. CAPTION
CESAR GUILLERGAN, ET AL. v. RODOLFO GANZON, as Mayor of the City of Iloilo, MUNICIPAL BOARD OF ILOILO CITY, CITY TREASURER and the CITY OF ILOILO, G.R. No. L-20818, May 25, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were market sweepers for the City of Iloilo who had served for 9 to 25 years. In 1955, they were dismissed but subsequently won a reinstatement order in Civil Case No. 3764, which became final and executory. However, the Municipal Board did not include their positions in the 1960-1961 city budget. Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus* to compel the restoration of their items and payment of salaries. Respondents argued the abolition was for economy, but the trial court found this reason to be a "smokescreen" for political exigency to replace petitioners with the respondents' followers. The trial court declared the abolition illegal and ordered reinstatement and back pay. Respondents appealed, questioning solely whether the City of Iloilo could be held liable for back salaries given the immunity clause in its Charter.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the City of Iloilo is liable for the back wages of the illegally dismissed market sweepers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The City of Iloilo is jointly liable with the other respondents. The Court rejected the respondents' reliance on Section 4 of the Iloilo City Charter (Commonwealth Act No. 158), which exempts the City from liability for damages arising from the failure of officers to enforce laws.

First, Section 3 of the same Charter expressly empowers the City to "sue and be sued." Second, the Court held that the operation of a market—the function in which petitioners were engaged—is not strictly a governmental function [1, 2]. Third, consistent with jurisprudence, municipal corporations may be held liable for back pay of employees illegally separated from service, even those involved in primarily governmental functions [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
