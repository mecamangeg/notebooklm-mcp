I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. AMBROCIO CANO Y PINEDA, G.R. No. L-19660, May 24, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 21, 1960, Ambrocio Cano, driving a La Mallorca Pambusco bus, collided with a Philippine Rabbit bus in San Fernando, Pampanga, causing property damage and physical injuries ranging from serious to slight to multiple passengers [1, 2]. On August 2, 1961, the Provincial Fiscal filed an information with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga charging Cano with "damage to property with multiple physical injuries, thru reckless imprudence" [3]. Cano filed a motion to quash, arguing, among other things, that "slight physical injuries" (a light felony) cannot be complexed with grave or less grave felonies under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code [4, 5]. The CFI granted the motion and ordered the prosecution to amend the information by deleting the reference to slight physical injuries [6]. The prosecution appealed this order to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution may file a single information for damage to property and multiple physical injuries (including slight physical injuries) committed through reckless imprudence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's order, holding that the single information was proper.

The Court relied on the doctrine in *Quizon v. Justice of the Peace of Bacolor* (97 Phil. 342), which established that criminal negligence is a quasi-offense where the act punished is the *recklessness* or mental attitude of the accused, not the specific effects or consequences [7]. Therefore, the act should not be split into separate crimes based on the resulting injuries.

The Court emphasized that splitting the action—filing one information for the serious injuries/damage in the CFI and another for slight injuries in the municipal court—would cause "unnecessary inconvenience to the administration of justice in general and to the accused in particular," as it would require presenting the same evidence in two different courts [8]. Furthermore, since the CFI clearly had jurisdiction over the charges regarding damage to property and serious/less serious injuries, the proper procedure was to reserve resolution on the issue of complexing misdemeanors until after the trial on the merits [9].

The order appealed from was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for trial on the merits [10].
