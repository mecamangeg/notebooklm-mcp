I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO MACATAÑGAY v. THE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS and MARIANO DILAY, G.R. No. L-21673, May 16, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On April 14, 1961, petitioner Francisco Macatañgay obtained a permit for temporary agricultural use of a 1,200 square-meter lot in Sta. Clara, Batangas. He subsequently constructed dikes and fillings on the eastern bank of the Sta. Clara River (also known as Pantalan River). On September 5, 1961, respondent Mariano Dilay, a barrio lieutenant, filed a complaint with the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, alleging that Macatañgay’s constructions encroached into the river in violation of Republic Act No. 2056.

After notice and hearing, the Secretary found the river to be navigable and ordered the removal of the encroachments. Macatañgay filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas. The CFI denied the petition, ruling that the river is navigable and that the factual findings of the Secretary are binding on the court. Macatañgay appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the river is not navigable and that the Secretary’s findings are not binding [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the findings of fact of the Secretary of Public Works regarding the nature of the river are binding on the courts.
2. W/N the Sta. Clara River is a navigable river.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the findings of fact of the Secretary of Public Works in the exercise of his powers under Republic Act No. 2056, such as the existence of the stream and its previous navigable character, are entitled to respect from the courts in the absence of fraud, collusion, or grave abuse of discretion [5]. The power to clear navigable streams of unauthorized obstructions necessarily involves the determination of these incidental questions of fact, as established in *Lovina v. Moreno* [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court applied the rule of civil law that a navigable river is one that is "floatable," or capable of admitting floats. Citing *Villongco v. Moreno*, the Court reiterated that a river with a depth of one foot at low tide is navigable [7]. The evidence showed that Sta. Clara River is 10 to 40 meters wide, with a depth ranging from a few inches to 1 ½ feet at low tide and up to 3 feet at high tide [8]. It serves as a passageway for boats carrying supplies and supports fishing, meeting the test of navigability which requires only that the river be capable of being used for commerce in its natural state, regardless of the mode [7, 8].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
