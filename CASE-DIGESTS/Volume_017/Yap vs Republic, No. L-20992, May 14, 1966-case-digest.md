**I. CAPTION**
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF KOCK TEE YAP alias UY Koc TE TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. KOCK TEE YAP alias UY Koc TE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20992, May 14, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Kock Tee Yap, a single Chinese citizen born in Davao City, filed a petition for naturalization [1, 2]. He was employed as a salesman at O.D. Commercial with a monthly salary of P300.00 and owned no real property [2]. During the proceedings, it was established that he used three different names: "Kock Tee Yap" in his immigration documents (ACR, Certificate of Residence) and employment; "Uy Koc Te" in his school records from elementary to college; and "Yap Kock Tee" in his income tax returns and statements of assets and liabilities [3, 4]. He was not authorized by proper authorities to use any name other than "Kock Tee Yap," which appeared in his Alien Certificate of Registration [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Davao granted the petition, finding he possessed all qualifications [7]. The Republic appealed, questioning his income and his use of aliases [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner despite his unauthorized use of aliases.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that a monthly salary of P300.00 for a single applicant who owns no real property does not constitute a lucrative trade or profession, especially considering the prevailing low buying power of the Philippine currency [8]. The Court relied on established jurisprudence in *Dy v. Republic*, *Uy v. Republic*, and *Sy v. Republic* to support this conclusion [8].

2. **NO.** The petitioner’s use of the names "Uy Koc Te" and "Yap Kock Tee" without judicial authority violated Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law) [6]. The Court distinguished this case from *People v. Uy Jui Pio*, noting that the petitioner did not use the aliases *along with* his true name but used them interchangeably for different purposes (e.g., one name for school, another for tax purposes) without revealing his other identities [9, 10]. This practice of occasional concealment creates suspicion and constitutes conduct that is not proper and irreproachable, rendering him unworthy of Philippine citizenship [10].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [11].
