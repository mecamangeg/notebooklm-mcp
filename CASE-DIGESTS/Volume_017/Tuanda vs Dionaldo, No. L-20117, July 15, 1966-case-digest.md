I. CAPTION
RESTITUTO TUANDA v. SIMPLICIO DIONALDO and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20117, July 15, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In the elections of November 10, 1959, Simplicio Dionaldo was proclaimed mayor-elect of Jimalalud, Negros Oriental, prevailing over Restituto Tuanda [1]. Tuanda filed an election protest. The Court of First Instance declared Dionaldo the winner by a plurality of six votes [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment but modified the finding to state that Dionaldo won by a majority of only two votes [2]. Tuanda filed the instant petition for review to determine who should be declared the winner [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the election protest has become moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that there was no need to resolve the issue or make a pronouncement as to who should have been declared the mayor-elect because the term of office for all local officials elected in the November 1959 elections had already expired on December 30, 1963 [3]. Consequently, the case was deemed moot and academic, and the petition was dismissed [3, 4].
