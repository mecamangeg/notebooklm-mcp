I. CAPTION
**PACENCIA O. ITCHON v. JUAN M. BALIGOD and ISABEL S. SERRANO alias ISABEL S. BALIGOD**, G.R. No. L-20962, May 27, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 29, 1961, Pacencia O. Itchon filed a complaint against the spouses Juan and Isabel Baligod [1]. The defendants filed an answer with a counterclaim for actual and moral damages [1]. Itchon subsequently filed a motion for a bill of particulars regarding the actual damages, which the trial court granted on November 11, 1961, ordering defendants to specify the nature of the damages [1].

Defendants failed to comply with the order. Consequently, on July 12, 1962, Itchon moved to strike out the counterclaim [1]. Before this motion could be resolved, the clerk of court set the case for trial on the merits [1]. The trial court then denied the motion to strike, erroneously claiming there was no proof defendants received the order for a bill of particulars [1, 2]. Itchon requested a postponement, arguing that issues had not yet been joined due to the pending bill of particulars [1]. The trial court denied the request and dismissed the case on August 14, 1962, ruling that Itchon’s failure to appear at trial constituted a lack of interest to prosecute [1]. Itchon appealed [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the issues were already joined when the case was calendared for trial.
2. W/N the dismissal of the case for failure to prosecute due to plaintiff's non-appearance was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A case is only ready for trial after the submission of the last pleading [3]. When an answer contains a counterclaim, it is not the last pleading; rather, the response to the counterclaim is the last pleading necessary for the joinder of issues [3]. A counterclaim is equivalent to a complaint against the plaintiff and itself calls for an answer (citing *Pongos v. Hidalgo Enterprises, Inc.*) [3, 4]. In this case, Itchon had not yet answered the counterclaim because she was waiting for the bill of particulars ordered by the court [2, 4]. Since the court never set aside the order requiring the bill of particulars, nor struck the counterclaim, the time for Itchon to answer had not yet arrived [2, 5]. Thus, issues were not joined [5].

2. **NO.** Since the issues had not been joined, the case should not have been calendared for trial [5]. Consequently, the plaintiff's failure to attend the premature trial did not constitute a lack of interest to prosecute [5].

The order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Chief Justice Bengzon and Justices Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, and Zaldivar concurred) [6].
