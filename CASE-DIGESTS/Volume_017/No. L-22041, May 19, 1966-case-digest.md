I. CAPTION
MELECIO CLARINIO UJANO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22041, May 19, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Melecio Ujano, born in the Philippines of Filipino parents, left for the United States in 1927 and became a naturalized American citizen after residing there for over 20 years [1]. On November 10, 1960, he returned to the Philippines and was admitted as a temporary visitor [1]. He subsequently filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Sur to reacquire his Philippine citizenship [1]. The CFI denied his petition, ruling that he failed to comply with the residency requirement of the law, as his status as a temporary visitor did not constitute the legal residence required [2]. Ujano appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the six-month residency requirement for reacquiring Philippine citizenship under Commonwealth Act No. 63 despite being admitted only as a temporary visitor.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the term "residence" in Section 3(1) of Commonwealth Act No. 63 means "legal residence" or "domicile" [2, 3]. Domicile is characterized by *animus manendi* (intent to remain permanently), requiring not just physical presence but also conduct indicative of an intention to reside in a fixed place [4, 5]. The Court relied on *Uytengsu v. Republic* (95 Phil. 890), ruling that an alien admitted as a temporary visitor cannot establish domicile because their stay is temporary in nature and they must leave once the purpose of their visit is accomplished [5, 6]. Consequently, the only way for the petitioner to meet the residency requirement is to secure a quota for permanent residence [3]. The judgment appealed from was affirmed [7].
