I. CAPTION
TE ATTA UY VDA. DE CAJUCOM v. MANILA REMNANT CO., INC. and THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19376, August 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Manila Remnant Co., Inc. (lessor) and petitioner Te Atta Uy Vda. de Cajucom (lessee) entered into an agreement in 1957 authorizing broker A.U. Valencia & Co. to sell the lessor's land and the lessee's improvements for P370,000.00 [1]. The contract stipulated that the lessee would pay a monthly rental of P1,750.00 "until and after (the) property... shall have been actually sold" [2, 3]. Three months later, the broker resigned his commission due to the unreasonable price fixed for the improvements [4]. Respondent subsequently demanded that petitioner vacate the premises.

Respondent filed an action for illegal detainer. The Municipal Court dismissed the action, sustaining the lessee [4]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) reversed the decision and ordered petitioner to vacate within three months [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the CFI's decision [4]. Petitioner contends that the 1957 contract created a condition precedent, entitling her to possession until the property is sold [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the 1957 agreement entitled the lessee to remain in possession indefinitely until the property was actually sold.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the stipulation regarding the lease duration referred only to the specific power to sell given to A.U. Valencia & Co. [6]. When the agent resigned his commission and manifested inability to sell on the specified terms, the 1957 agreement became *functus officio* (no longer having binding force), and the situation reverted to the status quo ante [5, 6].

Consequently, the lease returned to being one without a definite period. Under Article 1687 of the Civil Code, since the rental was paid monthly, the lease is considered to be on a month-to-month basis [5]. While the courts may fix a longer term for lessees occupying for over a year, the CFI had already exercised this power by granting a three-month period to vacate, which had already elapsed [5].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [7].
