I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DIEGO VILLANUEVA**, G.R. No. L-18769, May 27, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Diego Villanueva, the Chief of the City Delivery Section of the Cebu City Post Office, was charged with infidelity in the custody of documents and suspended from office. On December 27, 1960, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu acquitted him for insufficiency of evidence. The decision also ordered his reinstatement and the payment of back salaries and emoluments during his suspension.

The City Fiscal received the decision on January 17, 1961, and filed a notice of appeal on January 18, 1961, questioning the legality of the award of back salaries. Villanueva moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the Fiscal failed to serve him a copy of the notice and failed to file a record on appeal. On May 26, 1961, believing it still had jurisdiction, the CFI issued an "amendatory decision" *motu proprio*, deleting the award of back salaries to conform with Supreme Court jurisprudence, and consequently dismissed the Fiscal's appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Fiscal's appeal was perfected despite the lack of service of notice to the accused and the absence of a record on appeal.
2. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the amendatory decision after the notice of appeal had been filed.
3. W/N the trial court could validly order the payment of back salaries to the accused upon his acquittal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the opposite party is not fatal to the perfection of the appeal as long as the notice was filed on time pursuant to Sec. 5, Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Court [1, 2]. Furthermore, an appeal regarding the civil aspect of a criminal case does not require the filing of a record on appeal, as the nature of the case remains criminal [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The court loses jurisdiction to amend its decision once an appeal is perfected. The appeal was perfected when the City Fiscal filed the notice of appeal on January 18, 1961 [4]. Consequently, the CFI lost jurisdiction to alter the judgment, rendering the amendatory decision of May 26, 1961 null and void [4, 5].

3. **NO.** While the court may order the reinstatement of a suspended public officer upon acquittal, it is not within the court's power to order the payment of salaries and emoluments not received during the suspension [6, 7]. This matter falls within the province of administrative authorities [8].

**Disposition:** The original decision dated December 27, 1960 is **MODIFIED** by eliminating the portion ordering the payment of salaries and emoluments. The amendatory decision dated May 26, 1961 is declared **NULL and VOID** [9].
