I. CAPTION
MIGUEL MAPALO, ET AL. v. MAXIMO MAPALO, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-21489 and L-21628, May 19, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Miguel Mapalo and Candida Quiba, illiterate farmers, were the registered owners of a residential land in Pangasinan. Out of love for Miguel's brother, Maximo Mapalo, they intended to donate the eastern half of the land to him [1]. However, on October 15, 1936, they were deceived into signing a deed of absolute sale covering the *entire* land in Maximo's favor [1]. While the document stated a consideration of P500.00, the spouses received absolutely nothing [1, 2].

The spouses continued to possess the western half of the land [2]. Unknown to them, Maximo registered the deed in 1938 and obtained title over the whole property [3]. In 1951, Maximo sold the entire land to the Narcisos, who took possession only of the eastern portion [3, 4]. The Narcisos later filed suit to recover possession of the western portion, while the Mapalo spouses filed a counterclaim and a separate complaint to annul the sale regarding said portion [4, 5].

The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the Mapalo spouses, declaring the sale of the western half void [6, 7]. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that because consent was obtained by fraud, the contract was merely voidable, and the action to annul had prescribed four years after registration [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deed of sale regarding the western portion is void *ab initio* for lack of consideration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the contract of sale for the western portion is void *ab initio*, not merely voidable.

The Court distinguished between a contract with a *false* consideration and one with *no* consideration. Under the Old Civil Code (applicable to the 1936 deed), a statement of false consideration renders a contract voidable (Art. 1276), while a contract without any consideration produces no effect whatsoever and is void (Art. 1275) [9, 10]. A contract with false consideration has a real consideration hidden beneath the false one; a contract with no consideration has none at all [11].

In this case, while the deed stated a price of P500.00, the purchase price was in fact never paid [10, 12]. There was a total absence of consideration, not merely a false one stated to hide another [13]. Citing *Ocejo, Perez & Co. v. Flores*, the Court ruled that a contract of sale is null and void where the price appearing as paid has never been paid [12]. Since the contract was inexistent and void *ab initio*, the defect is permanent and incurable, and the action or defense for the declaration of its inexistence does not prescribe [12]. The Court also affirmed the lower court's finding that the Narcisos were purchasers in bad faith [14, 15].

Petition granted. Judgment of the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside; judgment of the Court of First Instance affirmed *in toto*.
