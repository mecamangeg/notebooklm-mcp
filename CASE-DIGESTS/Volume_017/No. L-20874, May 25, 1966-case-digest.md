I. CAPTION
IN RE PETITION FOR THE CHANGE OF NAME OF JOSELITO YU. JOSELITO YU, represented by his guardian ad litem, JUAN S. BARRERA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20874, May 25, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Joselito Yu, a 13-year-old Chinese citizen and resident of Manila for more than three years, filed a petition through his guardian *ad litem* to change his name to "Ricardo Sy." He alleged that he had used this name since childhood, was enrolled in school under it, and was baptized with it [1, 2]. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila *motu proprio* dismissed the petition without a hearing, ruling that Rule 103 of the Revised Rules of Court regarding change of name cannot be invoked by aliens, as their family rights and status should be governed by the laws of their own country [1, 3, 4]. The Solicitor General supported the petitioner's appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a resident alien can file a petition for a change of name under Rule 103 of the Revised Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Rule 103 does not state that only Filipino citizens may petition for a change of name. Section 1 of the Rule uses the word "person," a generic term embracing all natural persons, and does not require the petitioner's citizenship to be stated [5, 6]. The only requirements are verification, three years of *bona fide* residence, valid cause, and specification of the name sought [6].

The Court held that a change of name under Rule 103 does not alter a person’s legal capacity, civil status, citizenship, or existing family rights and duties [7, 8]. It merely changes the label or appellation used to distinguish the individual [8]. While Article 15 of the Civil Code binds citizens to Philippine laws regarding status and capacity, a name change does not affect these matters [4, 8]. Consequently, an alien is not disqualified from filing a petition, though granting the change remains a matter of judicial discretion based on the reasons adduced [9, 10].

The order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [11].
