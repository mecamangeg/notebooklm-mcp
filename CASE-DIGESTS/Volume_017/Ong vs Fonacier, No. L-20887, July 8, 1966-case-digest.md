I. CAPTION
JUAN ONG v. ISABELO FONACIER; ISABELO F. FONACIER v. FERNANDO A. GAITE, G.R. No. L-20887, July 8, 1966, 17 SCRA 617, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Juan Ong sued Defendant Isabelo Fonacier for the recovery of a sum of money (loans) and damages. Fonacier filed an answer with a compulsory counterclaim and a third-party complaint against Fernando Gaite regarding mining royalty disputes. After the trial court granted Fonacier two postponements, the trial was set for November 5, 1958. On that day, Fonacier’s counsel filed a telegraphic motion for postponement because he had a hearing in Manila, but this motion was not served on Ong. The trial court denied the motion, proceeded with the trial in Fonacier’s absence, and rendered a decision ordering Fonacier to pay Ong and Gaite. Fonacier appealed, arguing that the denial of postponement violated his right to be heard and that the decision was premature because various motions (e.g., motions to declare default) were still pending and issues were allegedly not yet joined.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion for postponement and trying the case in Fonacier's absence.
2. W/N the decision was premature on the ground that issues were not yet joined due to pending motions.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Motions for postponement are addressed to the sound discretion of the court and are not to be taken for granted. The Court found no abuse of discretion as this was Fonacier's third motion, and he was represented by two counsels, so the absence of one did not leave him without representation. Furthermore, the motion was not served on the adverse party (Ong). Citing *Manakil v. Revilla*, the Court ruled that a motion for postponement not served on the adverse party is "but a scrap of paper which the court is not bound to consider, much less to grant." [1]

2. **NO.** Issues are joined by the pleadings, not by motions. Since all parties had filed responsive pleadings, the issues were deemed joined. The fact that Ong had not answered Fonacier's counterclaim was immaterial because it was a compulsory counterclaim, for which no answer is needed to join issues (*Navarro v. Bello*). The Court held that by proceeding to decide the case, the lower court effectively denied all pending motions and considered the responsive pleadings properly filed. [2-4]

However, regarding the award of damages, the Court ruled that the period of delay occasioned by the lower court's error in initially refusing to allow Fonacier's appeal (until compelled by Mandamus) should be excluded from the computation of interest. [5]

**Decision affirmed.** [6]
