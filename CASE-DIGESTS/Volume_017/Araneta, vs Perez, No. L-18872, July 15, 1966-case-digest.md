I. CAPTION
J. ANTONIO ARANETA v. ANTONIO PEREZ, G.R. No. L-18872, July 15, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
J. Antonio Araneta was the trustee of a testamentary trust established in 1948 by the will of Angela S. Tuason for the beneficiaries Benigno, Angela, and Antonio Perez y Tuason [1-3]. On April 30, 1955, Araneta executed a deed of donation to the City of Manila covering a lot within the trusteeship that was being used as a street [3]. The donation aimed to save the trust from paying realty taxes and maintenance costs, and was necessary for the conversion of the property into a residential subdivision [4]. Antonio Perez, the judicial guardian of the beneficiaries, opposed the donation, arguing that Article 736 of the New Civil Code prohibits trustees from donating entrusted properties [5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal approved the donation, prompting Perez to appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trustee is prohibited from donating the property under Article 736 of the New Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The donation is valid. First, Article 736 of the New Civil Code, which prohibits guardians and trustees from donating entrusted properties, cannot apply retroactively to a testamentary trust established in 1948, as the Code only took effect on August 30, 1950 [5]. Under Articles 2253 and 2255 of the New Civil Code, the prohibition does not apply to acts or events governed by former laws, and the old Civil Code contained no such prohibition [5].

Second, the Court held that the prohibition in Article 736 envisions "gifts of pure beneficence" arising solely from liberality [6]. Since the donation in this case was clearly beneficial to the trust (saving taxes and maintenance) and necessary for the subdivision project, applying the prohibition would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the law, which is meant to protect beneficiaries [6].

The order of the lower court is **affirmed** [6].
