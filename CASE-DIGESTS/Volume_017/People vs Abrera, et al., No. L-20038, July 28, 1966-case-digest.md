I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DELFIN ABRERA, G.R. No. L-20038, July 28, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Delfin Abrera and Romy Ubana were accused of murdering Demetrio Copino, Jr. in November 1961 in Labo, Camarines Norte [1, 2]. After the victim went missing, a barrio lieutenant discovered a grave containing a decomposed body [3]. Upon investigation, Abrera and Ubana confessed to the Chief of Police that they killed Copino with a piece of wood and a bolo while he was sleeping because of his domineering character [3, 4]. Ubana reenacted the burying of the body at the grave site, while Abrera admitted his participation [3].

Initially, both accused pleaded guilty in the Justice of the Peace Court [1]. In the Court of First Instance (CFI), Ubana pleaded guilty, but Abrera pleaded not guilty, claiming during trial that Ubana acted alone and that he only confessed out of fear [5, 6]. The CFI rejected this defense, noting Abrera was older and physically larger than Ubana, and sentenced Abrera to death [5, 7]. Abrera appealed, arguing his extrajudicial confession was insufficient to convict him as it was not corroborated by proof of the *corpus delicti* [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confession is sufficiently corroborated by evidence of the *corpus delicti* to sustain a conviction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the confession was sufficiently corroborated. The rule requiring an extrajudicial confession to be corroborated by evidence of the *corpus delicti* does not mean all elements of the crime must be clearly established by independent evidence; it only requires "some evidence tending to show the commission of the crime apart from the confession," citing *People v. Bantayan* [8].

Here, the *corpus delicti* was established by the finding of the skull (identified by the victim's mother) and the decomposed body in the grave pointed to by the accused [9]. The Court noted that a confession which corresponds with reality—such as the police finding the corpse in the specific place indicated by the killer—is impossible to disbelieve [10]. Additionally, Abrera had previously pleaded guilty before the Justice of the Peace Court [11].

The decision was **MODIFIED**; the accused was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* instead of death due to the lack of sufficient votes for the capital penalty [12].
