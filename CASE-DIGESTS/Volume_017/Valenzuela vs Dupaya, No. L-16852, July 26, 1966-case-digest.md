I. CAPTION
PILAR L. DE VALENZUELA v. TITO M. DUPAYA, G.R. No. L-16852, July 26, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Dupaya applied for authority to operate a 15-ton ice plant in Lal-lo, Cagayan. Petitioner Valenzuela, who operated a 6-ton ice plant in the neighboring town of Aparri, opposed the application. The Public Service Commission (PSC) extended Valenzuela’s period to present evidence before the Justice of the Peace of Aparri until February 24, 1960, explicitly warning that no further extension would be granted. Valenzuela presented witnesses on February 23 and 24 but moved for another extension (15 to 30 days) claiming her witnesses from Gonzaga could not cross a swollen river. The PSC denied the motion, considered the case submitted, and rendered a decision granting Dupaya's application. Valenzuela appealed, arguing the denial of the extension deprived her of her day in court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission gravely abused its discretion in denying the petitioner's motion for extension of time to present evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion. The PSC's limitation was justified by the hearing officer's impending retirement; allowing a new officer to take over would have caused unavoidable delay while they reviewed the record [1, 2].

Furthermore, the petitioner failed to show that the unpresented testimony would have altered the result. She did not file a motion for rehearing supported by affidavits stating the substance of the intended testimony, which was the proper procedural step [3, 4]. Even if her manager testified that her production in Aparri was sufficient, it would not overcome the evidence that she failed to distribute ice effectively to other municipalities. Citing *San Miguel Brewery v. Espiritu* and *Santiago Ice Plant v. Lahoz*, the Court reiterated that an ice plant in the locality is judicially noticed as being more advantageous to the public than one located elsewhere [3, 5].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed.
