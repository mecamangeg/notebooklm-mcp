I. CAPTION
JOSEPH SOGLOU alias GO SIOK DU alias JOSEPH GO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20318, May 19, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Joseph Soglou Go, a Chinese citizen born in Amoy, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Cebu [1-3]. The Republic appealed the decision [3]. The records revealed that for many years, the petitioner used three different names—Joseph Go, Go Siok Du, and Joseph Soglou Go—in his transactions and dealings with the public without judicial authority [3]. It was only in 1959, shortly before applying for naturalization, that he filed a petition to legally change his name to "do away" with these aliases [3]. Furthermore, records showed that at the age of 14, the petitioner was arrested by the Cebu City police during a gambling raid, although no information was subsequently filed against him [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from becoming a Filipino citizen due to his unauthorized use of aliases and involvement in a gambling raid.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and denied the petition [5].

The Court ruled that the petitioner’s use of multiple names without prior authority violated **Commonwealth Act No. 142** (the Anti-Alias Law) [3]. His subsequent filing of a petition to change his name did not cure his previous "contumacious and willful" violation of the statute, as this move was merely in contemplation of his naturalization application [6]. The absence of criminal prosecution under C.A. 142 does not erase the fact that his behavior was improper and not expected of a prospective citizen [6].

Furthermore, regarding his arrest in a gambling raid, the Court held that his explanation of "mistake" carried little weight [4]. The incident created a suspicion that he was engaged in gambling, failing the requirement that an applicant must show, in a manner admitting of no doubt, that he is a man of integrity and good moral character [4].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [5].
