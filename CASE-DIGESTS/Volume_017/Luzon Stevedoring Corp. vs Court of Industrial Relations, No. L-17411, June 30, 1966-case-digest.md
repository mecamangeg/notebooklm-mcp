I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and LUSTEVECO EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION—CCLU, G.R. No. L-17411, June 30, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Lusteveco Employees Association (LEA) filed a second motion for reconsideration after the Supreme Court denied their first motion regarding a labor dispute. LEA argued that their return-to-work offer did not technically demand "strike duration pay" as previously held. They also reiterated previous arguments regarding the reduction of the 1958 Christmas bonus, the dismissal of various union members and bulk oil workers, and factual findings concerning the working days of employee Anastacio Legaspi. Finally, LEA pointed out a clerical error in the Court's previous resolution regarding the location of certain evidence (Exhibits A, A-1, and A-2), specifically whether they were found on a "union" or "company" secretary's table.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the return-to-work offer included a demand for strike duration pay despite not explicitly mentioning it.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that while the return-to-work offer did not explicitly state "strike duration pay," it invoked the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) order dated June 21, 1958, which had granted such pay [1]. By invoking the CIR order, the offer incorporated the terms and conditions set therein by reference [1]. Regarding the clerical error, the Court corrected the record to read "company secretary" but ruled that this did not affect the issue of whether the documents were admissible or how they were found [2]. As to the other matters (bonuses and dismissals), the Court found no new reasons to overturn its previous discussion [2].

The Second Motion for Reconsideration was denied for lack of merit [3].
