I. CAPTION
SIMON DE LA CRUZ v. THE CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21574, June 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Eduardo de la Cruz, a mucker employed by Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc., was a holder of an accident insurance policy issued by Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. On January 1, 1957, Eduardo participated in a non-professional boxing contest sponsored by his employer for New Year’s celebrations. During the bout, Eduardo slipped unintentionally and was hit by his opponent on the left part of the back of the head, causing him to fall and hit his head on the ring's ropes. He died the following day due to intracranial hemorrhage.

Eduardo’s father, Simon de la Cruz (beneficiary), filed a claim for indemnity. The insurance company denied the claim, arguing that the death was not "accidental" because Eduardo’s participation in the boxing match was voluntary. Simon filed a suit for specific performance. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ruled in favor of Simon. The insurance company appealed, contending that the voluntary participation was the "means" that produced the injury, and thus the death was not caused by "accidental means."

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the death of the insured resulting from a voluntary boxing match constitutes death by "accidental means" covered by the insurance policy.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the death was covered by the policy. The terms "accident" and "accidental" have no technical meaning in insurance and are construed in their ordinary sense as events happening by chance, fortuitously, or unexpectedly [1].

While there is a distinction in some jurisdictions between "accidental" and "accidental means," the general rule is that death or injury is not accidental if it is the natural result of a voluntary act, *unless* "some additional, unexpected, independent and unforeseen happening occurs which produces or brings about the result of injury or death" [2]. In this case, while Eduardo voluntarily participated in the boxing match, his slipping was an unfortunate and unintentional incident. Without this slip, he might not have received the fatal blow [3]. Furthermore, death is not the ordinarily anticipated result of boxing [4].

Additionally, the insurance policy specifically excluded risks such as football, hunting, and racing, but did not exclude boxing. The failure to explicitly include boxing among the prohibitive risks implies that the insurer did not intend to exempt itself from liability for death resulting from it [4].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred in the main decision) [5].
