I. CAPTION
GODOFREDO N. FAVIS v. NICOMEDES T. RUPISAN, et al., G.R. No. L-22823, May 19, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1962, the Board of Directors of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration (PVTA) appointed petitioner Godofredo N. Favis as Assistant General Manager. Favis took his oath and assumed the duties of the office. However, his appointment was never submitted to nor approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service. On May 6, 1964, the PVTA Board passed a resolution declaring the position vacant on the grounds that Favis had been remiss in his duties and committed a breach of trust. The Board appointed respondent Canuto Fariñas, Jr. to replace him. Favis filed an original petition for *quo warranto* with the Supreme Court, claiming his removal violated his security of tenure under the Civil Service Law. Respondents argued that the position is highly confidential and removable at pleasure, or alternatively, that Favis' appointment was incomplete and invalid for lack of Civil Service approval.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is entitled to security of tenure despite the lack of approval of his appointment by the Commissioner of Civil Service.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner does not have security of tenure. First, the Court established that the position of Assistant General Manager of the PVTA falls under the classified or competitive service, as it has not been declared policy-determining, primarily confidential, or highly technical by the President as required by Section 12 of R.A. 2265 [1, 2].

Under the Civil Service Rules and R.A. 2260, appointments to the competitive service must be approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service to be valid and complete [3]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Gorospe v. Secretary of Public Works* that an appointment is not final until certified by the Commissioner [4]. Since Favis' appointment lacked this essential approval, he was not a fully instated civil service employee entitled to protection against unjust removal. The Court held that "tolerance, acquiescence or mistake of the proper officials" in allowing him to hold office and receive salary does not validate the appointment or waive the legal requirement [5]. Consequently, Favis was merely a *de facto* officer who could be removed from office even without cause [5].

Petition dismissed.
