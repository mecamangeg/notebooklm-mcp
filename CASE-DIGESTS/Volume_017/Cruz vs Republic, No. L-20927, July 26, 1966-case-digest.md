I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF THE MINOR ROSSANA E. CRUZ. ROSALINA E. CRUZ v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20927, July 26, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rosalina E. Cruz filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga City to adopt a minor. The child's name as recorded in the Local Civil Registrar was "Rossana Esperat Bucoy," but she was baptized as "Rossana E. Cruz," using the surname of the petitioner who had reared her. The petition and the order of hearing published in the newspaper used the child's baptismal name ("Rossana E. Cruz") instead of her official name in the civil register. The Republic opposed the petition, arguing that the court failed to acquire jurisdiction due to the substantial defect in the publication. The lower court granted the adoption, ruling it had jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the court acquired jurisdiction over the adoption case despite the notice by publication carrying the minor's baptismal name instead of her registered name.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the name of a person as recorded in the civil register, and not the baptismal name, is their real name for legal purposes. Baptismal names are not legally recognized (*Chomi v. Local Civil Registrar of Manila*). Adoption is a proceeding *in rem* requiring notice by publication to protect the interests of all concerned (*Ellis v. Republic*). These interests are not protected if the notice does not carry the true, officially recorded name of the child, as parties have a right to expect the use of the official name. The defect amounts to a failure of service by publication; hence, the trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the case (*Yuseco v. Republic*).

Decision reversed and petition dismissed without prejudice.
