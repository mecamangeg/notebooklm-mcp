I. CAPTION
BRISTOL MYERS COMPANY v. THE DIRECTOR OF PATENTS and UNITED AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., G.R. No. L-21587, May 19, 1966, J.P. Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
United American Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a petition to register the trademark "BIOFERIN" for a medicinal preparation used for colds and influenza. Bristol Myers Company, a US corporation authorized to do business in the Philippines, opposed the application. Bristol Myers owned the trademark "BUFFERIN" for an antacid analgesic, which was registered in the Philippines earlier than the applicant's use of "BIOFERIN". Both products fall under Class 6 (Medicines and Pharmaceutical Preparations). Bristol Myers argued that the two marks are confusingly similar in spelling, pronunciation, and letter-type design, which would mislead the public. The Director of Patents dismissed the opposition and granted the registration of "BIOFERIN", finding no confusing similarity. Bristol Myers appealed to the Supreme Court [1-5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trademark "BIOFERIN" is confusingly similar to "BUFFERIN".

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Director of Patents, ruling that the trademarks are not confusingly similar. In determining whether trademarks are confusingly similar, the test is not simply to compare the spelling and pronunciation of the words, but to consider the "two marks in their entirety, as they appear in the respective labels, in relation to the goods to which they are attached" (*Mead Johnson & Co. v. N.V.J. Van Dorp, Ltd.*) [6, 7].

Applying this test, the Court found that although "BIOFERIN" and "BUFFERIN" share the same suffix and have similar-sounding prefixes, they appear on labels with strikingly different backgrounds, colors, sizes, and designs [8]. Furthermore, "BIOFERIN" is expressly stated to be dispensable only upon doctor's prescription, whereas "BUFFERIN" is an over-the-counter remedy. This distinction renders the chance of confusion negligible [8].

The decision of the Director of Patents is affirmed [9].
