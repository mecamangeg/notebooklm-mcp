I. CAPTION
ONG v. FONACIER, [G.R. Number not provided in source], September 13, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Isabelo F. Fonacier filed a motion to amend the decision rendered on July 8, 1966, which affirmed the lower court's judgment ordering him to pay Plaintiff Ong and Third-Party Defendant Gaite sums of money with interest [1]. Fonacier requested clarification that interest should run from the filing of the complaint and counterclaim, respectively. He also argued that interest should not be charged for the period from July 24, 1959, to January 22, 1962 [2]. This period represented the time the appeal was erroneously held in abeyance by the lower court, at the instance of Gaite, until the Supreme Court issued a writ of *mandamus* to compel the appeal [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the period of delay occasioned by the lower court's error in refusing to allow the appeal should be excluded from the computation of interest.

IV. RULING
**YES.** While Article 2209 of the Civil Code provides for legal interest as indemnity for delay, the Court held it "fair and equitable" to exclude the period corresponding to the delay occasioned by the court *a quo's* error in refusing to allow the appeal [3]. The delay in this case was aggravated by the lower court's refusal to process the appeal until compelled by *mandamus* [3]. The decision was modified to compute interest from the filing of the complaint (July 11, 1956) and counterclaim (August 10, 1957), specifically excluding the period from July 24, 1959, to January 22, 1962 [4, 5].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [5].
