I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WILLIAM CHUA SIONG HUA TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES: WILLIAM CHUA SIONG HUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21400, May 31, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petitioner’s naturalization application, finding that he possessed all qualifications, including an annual income of P3,000 as an employee of Globe Electrical Supply. However, on September 24, 1962, when petitioner filed a motion to take his oath, the Solicitor General opposed on grounds of lack of lucrative occupation and violation of government regulations [1, 2]. The lower court disallowed the oath-taking, finding the income simulated [3]. The records revealed the petitioner was employed by his father's business while a 19-year-old student, receiving a high salary disproportionate to the business's small P50,000 capitalization, and that he turned his earnings over to his mother [4]. Additionally, the petitioner failed to register as an alien in 1958, for which he was fined P20, and blamed his father for this omission and for discrepancies in his recorded birth dates [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified due to improper conduct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that income derived from employment in the business of an applicant's father is dubious (*Lee v. Republic*, L-20148, April 30, 1965) [7, 8]. The circumstances—his youth, his status as a student, the high salary relative to the business's low capitalization—indicate he is not a *bona fide* employee but a dependent [4]. Even if the P3,000 annual income were true, it would be inadequate considering the purchasing power of the peso (*Keng Giok v. Republic*, L-13347, August 31, 1961) [5, 7].

2. **YES.** The petitioner’s failure to register and secure his certificate of residence in 1958 is a ground for disqualification (*Antonio Co Kay See v. Republic*, L-17318, December 28, 1962) [6, 9, 10]. Furthermore, the Court found the petitioner’s behavior of blaming his father for his legal difficulties—including the simulated income, failure to register, and name discrepancies—constitutes improper conduct that renders him unworthy of becoming a citizen [6, 9, 10].

The order denying the motion to take oath is AFFIRMED [11].
