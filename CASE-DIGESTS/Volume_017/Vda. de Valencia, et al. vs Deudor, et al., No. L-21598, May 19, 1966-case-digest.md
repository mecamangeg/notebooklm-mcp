I. CAPTION
ENCARNACION VDA. DE VALENCIA, ET AL. v. PEDRO DEUDOR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21598, May 19, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On February 4, 1949, Pedro Deudor sold a parcel of land in Quezon City to Andres Valencia for P3,600. Valencia made a down payment, with the balance payable within ten years. Valencia died in 1952, and his heirs (petitioners) sought to pay the balance, but Deudor and J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. refused payment. The refusal was based on a Compromise Agreement between Deudor and Tuason regarding a larger tract of land, which required new contracts at higher prices.

In 1956, petitioners filed a suit for specific performance against Deudor and Tuason. In 1961, Spouses Maximo Sison and Victoria Enriquez (respondents), claiming to have purchased the land from Tuason, allegedly forcibly entered the property and destroyed petitioners' fence. Petitioners amended their complaint to include the Sison spouses, alleging the spouses acted in bad faith to despoil them of land previously sold to their predecessor.

The Sison spouses moved to dismiss, arguing that the Deudor-Tuason Compromise Agreement had been rescinded by the Supreme Court in a separate case, extinguishing petitioners' preferential rights. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint against the Sison spouses for lack of cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amended complaint states a cause of action against the Sison spouses despite the rescission of the Deudor-Tuason Compromise Agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal.

The Court reiterated the rule that for purposes of a motion to dismiss based on lack of cause of action, the allegations in the complaint are deemed admitted (*Alquigue v. De Leon*). In this case, the petitioners' amended complaint relied not solely on the rescinded Compromise Agreement but on the original contract of sale executed by Pedro Deudor in favor of Andres Valencia in 1949. Therefore, a cause of action for specific performance remained against the vendor.

Furthermore, the amended complaint expressly alleged that the Sison spouses acted in bad faith in seeking to dispossess petitioners of the land. Admitting these allegations as true for the purpose of the motion, a valid cause of action was stated against said spouses.

The order of the trial court dismissing the amended complaint with respect to Spouses Sison and Enriquez was **REVERSED** and the case was remanded for further proceedings.
