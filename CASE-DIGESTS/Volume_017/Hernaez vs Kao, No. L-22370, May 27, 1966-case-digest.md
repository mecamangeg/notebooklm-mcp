I. CAPTION
LILIA HERNAEZ v. YAN KAO, G.R. No. L-22370, May 27, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Lilia Hernaez, a former salesgirl at Centro de Modas Tailoring, filed a claim in February 1963 with the Department of Labor against Yan Kao for unpaid wages, differential pay, premium pay, and overtime pay [1, 2]. The proceedings resulted in an amicable settlement, and Hernaez executed an "Affidavit of Release" before a Labor Attorney, stating she had been paid all her claims to her full satisfaction [2-4].

Despite the settlement, Hernaez filed a complaint in the City Court of Davao on April 27, 1963, seeking P1,641.90 for the exact same causes of action [1, 4]. The defendant moved to dismiss the case based on the release [2]. The City Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of First Instance of Davao affirmed the dismissal on appeal [5]. Hernaez elevated the case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the release amounted to a waiver of rights under Commonwealth Acts 303 and 444, which she claimed was invalid [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amicable settlement and affidavit of release executed by the employee bar a subsequent court action for the same money claims.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the amicable settlement is valid and binding, having the force of law between the parties [8, 9].

The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that the release was a prohibited waiver of labor rights. Distinguishing a waiver from a compromise, the Court explained that a waiver is the "intentional relinquishment of a known right" [7]. In this case, the plaintiff's claims had not yet been fully established or liquidated, so there was no "known right" relinquished; rather, it was a compromise of a controversy [7]. Citing *Mercader v. Manila Polo Club* and *McCarthy v. Barber Steamship Lines*, the Court ruled that a compromise is a valid ground for a motion to dismiss and cannot be unilaterally jettisoned by the plaintiff once executed voluntarily and to their full satisfaction [7-9].

The Order of the Court of First Instance of Davao is affirmed [10].
