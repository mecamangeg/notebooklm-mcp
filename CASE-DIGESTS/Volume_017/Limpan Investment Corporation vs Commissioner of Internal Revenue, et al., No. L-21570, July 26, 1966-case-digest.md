I. CAPTION
LIMPAN INVESTMENT CORPORATION v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21570, July 26, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Limpan Investment Corporation (Limpan) is a domestic corporation engaged in leasing real properties acquired from its president, Isabelo P. Lim, and his mother [1]. Limpan filed its 1956 and 1957 income tax returns, reporting net incomes of P3,287.81 and P11,098.36, respectively [2]. following an investigation, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) discovered that Limpan under-declared rental incomes by P20,199.00 in 1956 and P81,690.00 in 1957, and claimed excessive depreciation [2].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed deficiency income taxes and surcharges. Limpan protested, arguing that: (1) for 1956, previous owners collected part of the rentals; (2) for 1957, its president personally collected some rentals, a tenant deposited rentals in court due to a dispute, and a sub-tenant paid directly; and (3) its depreciation rates were justified due to the age of the buildings [3], [4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the CIR's assessment, noting that Limpan's own witness admitted to undeclaring a significant portion of the income found by the examiners [4], [5]. Limpan appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Limpan is liable for the deficiency income tax on the unreported rental income.
2. W/N the depreciation claimed by Limpan was excessive.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Limpan's own witness admitted that it had not declared more than half of the 1956 unreported income and more than one-third of the 1957 unreported income found by examiners [6]. Having admitted this, the burden was on Limpan to prove the remainder of its claims by clear and convincing evidence, which it failed to do [6]. regarding the court deposits, the withdrawal of the deposits in 1958 is not a justification for non-declaration in 1957 [7]. Since the deposit was resorted to because of Limpan's refusal to accept payment, Limpan is deemed to have **constructively received** such rentals in 1957 [8], [9], [7]. Furthermore, payments by a sub-tenant constitute rental income regardless of the source [9], [7].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the CTA's finding that the depreciation claimed was excessive. Depreciation is a question of fact determined by actual facts rather than theoretical yardsticks [10], [11]. The CTA's use of rates from Bulletin "F" of the U.S. Federal Internal Revenue Service was proper, as these rates have "strong persuasive effect" in this jurisdiction (*Zamora v. Collector of Internal Revenue*) [10], [11]. The CTA's findings were not shown to be arbitrary or an abuse of discretion (*Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Priscila Estate, Inc.*) [11].

**Decision affirmed.**
