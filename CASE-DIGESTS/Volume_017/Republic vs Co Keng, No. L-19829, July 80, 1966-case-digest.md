I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FRANCISCO CO KENG, G.R. No. L-19829, July 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Francisco Co Keng, a merchant born in Amoy, China, filed a petition for naturalization alleging that he resided at No. 428 Sto. Cristo, Manila. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition on October 31, 1956, and Co Keng took his oath of allegiance on December 29, 1958 [1]. On March 7, 1961, the Solicitor General filed a motion to cancel Co Keng’s certificate of naturalization on the grounds that it was obtained fraudulently and that Co Keng lacked good moral character [2].

The Solicitor General presented evidence that Co Keng had resided at No. 28, 12th Street, Broadway, Quezon City, a fact concealed in his petition. Supporting documents included a petition for estate administration (1955), his children's birth certificates (1951, 1954), and tax declarations, all listing the Quezon City address as his residence [3-5]. Co Keng argued that the Quezon City house was merely a "second address" or a place he visited, not a residence [6, 7]. Additionally, government examiners found that Co Keng had under-declared his income and underpaid taxes from 1948 to 1957, paying the deficiencies only in 1959 [8]. The lower court denied the motion to cancel, prompting the Republic to appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the certificate of naturalization should be cancelled due to the applicant's failure to state all former places of residence in his petition.
2. W/N the applicant failed to satisfy the requirement of proper and irreproachable behavior due to tax evasion.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) obliges the applicant to state all present and former places of residence in the petition [9]. This requirement refers to actual places of residence, not just legal domicile, and non-compliance is fatal to the petition [10]. The Court found Co Keng's explanation distinguishing "residence" from "address" unconvincing, as public documents consistently listed the Quezon City address as his residence [11]. The failure to disclose this residence justifies the denial of the petition and the cancellation of the certificate [12].

2. **YES.** The conduct of under-declaring income and underpaying income tax does not satisfy the "proper and irreproachable behavior" required of applicants for Philippine citizenship [13]. The failure to enter true income in a tax return is conclusive evidence of dishonesty, indicating a lack of good moral character required by Section 2(3) of the Revised Naturalization Law [14].

**Order set aside; certificate of naturalization revoked.**
