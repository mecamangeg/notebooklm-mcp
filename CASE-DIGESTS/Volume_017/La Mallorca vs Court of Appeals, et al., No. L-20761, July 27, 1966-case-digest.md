I. CAPTION
LA MALLORCA v. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, MARIANO BELTRAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20761, July 27, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 20, 1953, respondents Mariano Beltran and his family boarded a bus owned by petitioner La Mallorca. Upon reaching their destination in Anao, Mexico, Pampanga, the family alighted. Mariano led his wife and children to a shaded spot about four to five meters away from the vehicle. He then returned to the bus, which was still stationary with the engine running, to retrieve a bag (*bayong*) he had left behind. His 4-year-old daughter, Raquel, followed him unnoticed. While Mariano was on the running board waiting for the conductor to hand him the bag, the bus suddenly started moving forward without a signal. Mariano jumped from the moving vehicle, but Raquel was run over and killed [1-4].

The trial court awarded the respondents P3,000.00 for the death of the child. The Court of Appeals affirmed the petitioner's liability, ruling that even if the contract of carriage had ended, La Mallorca was liable for *quasi-delict*. The CA increased the damages to P6,000.00, although the respondents did not appeal the trial court's decision [5]. Petitioner appealed, arguing the contract of carriage had terminated and the CA erred in increasing damages [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the contract of carriage had terminated when the child was killed.
2. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in increasing the damages awarded when the respondents did not appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The relationship of carrier and passenger does not cease the moment the passenger alights but continues until the passenger has had a reasonable time or opportunity to leave the carrier's premises [7]. The father's return to the bus for his baggage was reasonable, and the family's presence near the bus was not unreasonable; thus, they were still considered passengers entitled to protection [6, 8]. The driver failed to exercise the "utmost diligence" required by Article 1755 of the Civil Code by starting the bus while the conductor was still unloading baggage and without a signal [8]. Even assuming *arguendo* the contract had terminated, the petitioner is liable for *quasi-delict* under Article 2180 of the Civil Code due to the negligence of its driver, which raises a presumption of employer negligence that petitioner failed to overcome [9, 10].

2. **YES.** Generally, an appellate court can only pass upon questions or issues raised in the appellant's brief [11]. The respondents (plaintiffs) did not appeal the trial court's award of P3,000.00, nor did they point out its inadequacy in their brief as an exception to the rule [11]. Therefore, the increase to P6,000.00 cannot be sustained [11, 12].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is modified; petitioner is ordered to pay P3,000.00 for the death of Raquel Beltran and P400.00 as actual damages [12].
