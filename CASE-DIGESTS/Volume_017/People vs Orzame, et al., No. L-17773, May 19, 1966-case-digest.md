I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EMETERIO ORZAME, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17773, May 19, 1966, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Emeterio Orzame, Dominador Magno, and Arturo Gallarde conspired to kill Juan Dulay to collect the latter’s P3,000.00 insurance proceeds, of which Orzame was the sole beneficiary [1]. On February 23, 1958, in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, the three men led Dulay to a railroad track [1, 2]. Orzame beat Dulay to death with the handle of a Thompson sub-machine gun and stabbed him, then placed the body across the tracks to simulate a train accident [2].

Magno was discharged to become a state witness, while Gallarde was acquitted for insufficiency of evidence [3]. The trial court convicted Orzame of murder qualified by evident premeditation, with aggravating circumstances of treachery and unnecessary cruelty, sentencing him to death [1]. Orzame appealed, raising the defense of alibi—claiming he was bedridden with pneumonia—and challenging the credibility of Magno as a polluted source [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimony of a discharged state witness is credible.
2. W/N the defense of alibi should prosper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the mere circumstance that a witness was a former co-accused discharged to become a state witness should not be considered against his credibility [6, 7]. Magno’s testimony incriminating Orzame was a reiteration of his affidavit and preliminary investigation testimony given long before his discharge, citing *People v. Riparip* [5, 7]. Furthermore, autopsy findings corroborating the specific injuries inflicted by the sub-machine gun and knife supported Magno's account [5, 8].

2. **NO.** Alibi is generally a weak defense as it is easy to concoct and must be proved by positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence [9, 10]. The Court affirmed the trial court’s rejection of the alibi, noting it was medically improbable for Orzame to be cured of lobar pneumonia in two days [11]. Positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator defeats the defense of alibi [12].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [13].
