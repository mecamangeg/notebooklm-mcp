I. CAPTION
BATANGAS LAGUNA TAYABAS BUS COMPANY, petitioner, vs. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and EASTERN TAYABAS BUS COMPANY, INC., respondents., Nos. L-25994 and L-26004 to L-26046, August 31, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. (BLTB) and respondent Eastern Tayabas Bus Co. (Eastern) entered into a lease agreement whereby Eastern leased its lines and equipment to BLTB. This agreement was approved by the respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) [1, 2]. On March 11, 1966, Eastern sent a letter to BLTB terminating the lease based on a 60-day notice clause (Paragraph 7) in the contract [3]. Without waiting for the 60 days to lapse, Eastern filed an application with the PSC to modify the certificates of public convenience and take over the lines [4].

BLTB opposed the termination, arguing that the clause was fraudulently inserted, that there were unliquidated obligations, and that the contract required arbitration (Paragraph 17) [5, 6]. BLTB filed a motion to dismiss the PSC application for lack of jurisdiction, which the PSC denied [7]. BLTB then filed a civil suit in the Court of First Instance of Laguna for the annulment of the lease provisions and subsequently filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to stop the PSC proceedings [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute regarding the interpretation and termination of the lease contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Public Service Commission is not a judicial tribunal; its functions are administrative and limited by statute [9]. It cannot pass upon questions within the exclusive province of the ordinary courts, such as the validity or interpretation of a contract [9]. The Court held that since the PSC had already approved the lease agreement, it was not the proper body to resolve disputes arising from the contract's interpretation during its effectivity [10].

The dispute concerning the right to terminate the lease via 60-day notice versus the requirement for arbitration involves the "private aspect" of the agreement and the private rights of the parties [11]. Citing *City of Manila v. Manila Electric R.R. & Light Co.* (36 Phil. 89), the Court ruled that the PSC has no control over a public utility in its private aspect [11]. Therefore, the controversy must be threshed out in the ordinary courts [11].

Petition granted. The Public Service Commission is declared without jurisdiction to continue with the subject cases until final judgment is rendered by the Court of First Instance [12].
