I. CAPTION
ISIDORO MONDRAGON v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17666, June 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On July 11, 1954, in Miagao, Iloilo, complainant Serapion Nacionales was opening a dike in his ricefield when petitioner Isidoro Mondragon shouted at him to stop. Mondragon approached and tried to hit Nacionales with his fist. When Nacionales dodged, Mondragon drew his bolo and struck him, inflicting injuries that would heal in 20 to 25 days [1-3]. Nacionales drew his own bolo and fought back, causing Mondragon to retreat [1].

The Court of First Instance of Iloilo found Mondragon guilty of attempted homicide [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, inferring "intent to kill" from Mondragon's testimony during trial—five years after the incident—that he would "do everything he could to stop Nacionales from digging the canal" [3, 5]. Mondragon appealed, arguing the facts did not establish an intent to kill [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is guilty of attempted homicide based on the established intent to kill.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court modified the conviction to **less serious physical injuries**.

The Court held that the intent to kill, being an essential element of frustrated or attempted homicide, must be proved by clear and convincing evidence with the same degree of certainty as other elements of the crime [7]. The inference of such intent should not be drawn in the absence of circumstances sufficient to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, citing *People v. Villanueva* [7].

The Court found that Mondragon's statement that he would "do everything" to stop the complainant, made five years after the incident, was not a categorical statement of intention to kill and should be construed to give the petitioner the benefit of the doubt [8]. Furthermore, the facts indicated a lack of homicidal urge: Mondragon began the assault with fist blows, the bolo wounds inflicted were slight (healing in less than 30 days), and he retreated when the complainant fought back rather than holding his ground to kill him [9]. Absent the intent to kill, and considering the injuries were not fatal and required less than 30 days to heal, the crime committed was only less serious physical injuries under Article 265 of the Revised Penal Code [10].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED**. Petitioner is sentenced to three (3) months and fifteen (15) days of *arresto mayor* [11].
