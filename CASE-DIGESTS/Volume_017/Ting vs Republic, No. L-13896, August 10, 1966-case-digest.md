I. CAPTION
ERNESTO TING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-13896, August 10, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ernesto Ting was granted Philippine citizenship by the Court of First Instance of Manila in 1949, and a certificate of naturalization was issued in 1950 [1]. In 1954, the Solicitor General filed a motion to cancel the certificate on several grounds, primarily that it was obtained fraudulently [1, 2]. The State alleged that Ting falsely claimed to be born in Cavite, Philippines, when he was actually born in China [2]. Evidence revealed that Ting's name was missing from the Cavite birth registry and that the entry relied upon was inserted 30 years after his alleged birth [3, 4]. Furthermore, documents signed by Ting, such as his son’s birth certificate and his own immigration clearance, listed his birthplace as "Amoy, China" [5]. The State also argued he failed to file the requisite declaration of intention, noting his children were enrolled in the Chinese Anglo School [6]. The lower court denied the motion to cancel, prompting the Republic to appeal [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the certificate of naturalization should be cancelled for being obtained illegally and fraudulently.
2. W/N the petitioner was exempt from filing a declaration of intention.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court found it positively established that the petitioner was not born in the Philippines and that his testimony and documents regarding his birth in Cavite were false and falsified [6]. The Court gave weight to the petitioner's own admissions in immigration documents stating his birth place as "Amoy, China," and the expert finding that the civil registry entry was a later insertion [5, 7]. Thus, the certificate was obtained illegally and fraudulently and must be cancelled [6].

2. **NO.** The petitioner was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention. Under Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, the exemption applies only if the applicant has given primary and secondary education to all his children in schools not limited to any race or nationality [8]. The petitioner's children were enrolled in the Chinese Anglo School, which is primarily for children of Chinese descent [8]. Furthermore, he failed to show that *all* his children received the required education [8]. Consequently, the failure to file the declaration rendered the entire naturalization proceedings void *ab initio* [8].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and the certificate of naturalization is CANCELLED [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred with the ruling [9].
