**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. ANDRES REYES, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VI, and ANG TO, G.R. No. L-22550, May 19, 1966, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Ang To, a Chinese citizen, was granted Philippine citizenship by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, presided over by respondent Judge Andres Reyes [1]. Subsequently, the Republic filed a motion to denaturalize Ang To and cancel his certificate of naturalization on grounds that it was fraudulently and illegally procured [2]. Judge Reyes denied the motion for lack of merit [3]. The Republic filed a notice of appeal, but Judge Reyes disapproved the Record on Appeal and dismissed it [3]. The Judge reasoned that Section 11 of the Naturalization Law (C.A. No. 473), which provides for appeals, appears before Section 18 (regarding cancellation of certificates), implying that appeals are only allowed for the initial grant of citizenship and not for cancellation proceedings [4]. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to compel the lower court to approve the appeal [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Republic may appeal a decision denying a petition to cancel a certificate of naturalization.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** A decision denying the State’s motion to cancel a naturalization certificate is a "final sentence" because it definitively disposes of the conflicting claims between the Republic and the naturalized citizen [6]. Section 11 of the Naturalization Law states that "The final sentence may... be appealed to the Supreme Court" [6]. The placement of Section 11 before Section 18 in the statute does not limit its application to decisions on naturalization applications; the law must be construed as a whole to effectuate the legislative intent [7]. It would be absurd to allow the State to appeal a decision granting citizenship but render it helpless to appeal a decision refusing to withdraw such privilege from an unworthy alien, especially given that denaturalization proceedings are infused with public interest [8]. The Court cited *Bell v. Attorney-General*, which held that the phrase "petitions for naturalization" includes motions to annul naturalization orders [9], [10].

The Order disapproving the Record on Appeal is set aside, and the respondent Judge is directed to give due course to the appeal [11].
