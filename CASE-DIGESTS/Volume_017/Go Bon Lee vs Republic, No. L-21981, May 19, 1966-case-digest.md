I. CAPTION
WILFREDO GO BON LEE v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21981, May 19, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Wilfredo Go Bon Lee, a Chinese national who arrived in the Philippines in 1919, previously held a certificate of naturalization. However, this was revoked by the Supreme Court on appeal by the Solicitor General because Go Bon Lee failed to enroll his minor children in Philippine schools [1]. Attempting to cure this defect, petitioner filed a new petition for naturalization on June 23, 1961, with the Court of First Instance of Cebu [2]. The City Fiscal opposed the petition on the same ground [2]. Petitioner argued he was exempt from the schooling requirement because he faced difficulties bringing his children to the Philippines, specifically that his mother-in-law objected because the children were allegedly sickly, and later, the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war prevented their travel [3, 4]. The trial court denied the petition, prompting this appeal [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is exempt from the requirement of enrolling his minor children in Philippine schools due to alleged difficulties in bringing them to the country.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found no merit in the petitioner's contention and held that his failure to bring his children to the Philippines to study was inexcusable [5, 6]. The mother-in-law's objection that the children were sickly did not constitute an insurmountable barrier [6]. The Court noted that the petitioner admitted to traveling to China on five different occasions (1924, 1933, 1937, 1938, and 1947) [6]. Furthermore, he successfully took his daughter Juanita to China in 1930 and brought her back to the Philippines in 1938 [7]. If he could bring one child, he could have brought the others had he truly wanted them to be educated in the Philippines [8]. The Court also noted that this matter can be considered *res judicata* given the previous revocation of his naturalization for the same failure [8].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED and the petition is DENIED [8].
