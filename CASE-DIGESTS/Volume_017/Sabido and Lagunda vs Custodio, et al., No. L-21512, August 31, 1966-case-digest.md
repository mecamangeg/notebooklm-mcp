I. CAPTION
PROSPERO SABIDO and ASER LAGUNDA v. CARLOS CUSTODIO, BELEN MAKABUHAY CUSTODIO and THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21512, August 31, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On June 9, 1955, Agripino Custodio was a passenger on a Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co. (LTB) bus driven by Nicasio Mudales. Due to a full load, Agripino was hanging on the left running board [1, 2]. While the bus was negotiating a sharp curve on a downward slope, it met a 6x6 truck owned by petitioner Prospero Sabido and driven by petitioner Aser Lagunda, which was climbing up from the opposite direction [2]. The truck was running at a fast speed and occupied the middle of the road instead of keeping to the right [3, 4]. The truck sideswiped Agripino, resulting in his death [2].

The Court of First Instance of Laguna found both the carrier (LTB and Mudales) and the petitioners (Sabido and Lagunda) negligent. It ordered them to jointly and severally indemnify the respondents (Agripino's heirs) in the sum of P6,000 [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [5]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the carrier's negligence in allowing the passenger on the running board was the exclusive cause of death, and that they cannot be held solidarily liable because their liability arises from quasi-delict while the carrier’s arises from a breach of contract [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners (truck owner and driver) are solidarily liable with the common carrier for the passenger's death despite the different sources of their obligations (quasi-delict vs. contract).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the solidary liability of the petitioners and the carrier. The Court reasoned that while the liability of the carrier implies a breach of contract and that of the petitioners springs from a quasi-delict, the negligence of both parties was the proximate cause of the victim's death [3, 7].

The Court found the petitioners guilty of contributory negligence for driving at considerable speed on a sharp curve and occupying the middle of the road [4]. Furthermore, petitioner Lagunda had the "last clear chance" to avoid the accident; he admitted seeing the passenger hanging on the bus 5 to 7 meters away but failed to exercise prudence by swerving to the right, where there was space to pass [2, 7, 8].

The Court applied the principle that "where the concurrent or successive negligent acts or omission of two or more persons, although acting independently of each other, are, in combination, the direct and proximate cause of a single injury to a third person... either is responsible for the whole injury" (38 Am. Jur. 946, 947) [3, 9].

Petition denied. Judgment affirmed [10].
