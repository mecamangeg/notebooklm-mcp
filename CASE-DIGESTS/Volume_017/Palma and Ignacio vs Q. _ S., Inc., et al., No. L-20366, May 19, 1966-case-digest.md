I. CAPTION
LEONORA S. PALMA and SERVILLANO IGNACIO v. Q. & S., INC. and JOSE F. ORETA, G.R. No. L-20366, May 19, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On October 3, 1961, respondent Q. & S., Inc. filed a complaint for ejectment (Civil Case No. 4491) against petitioners Leonora Palma and Servillano Ignacio in the Municipal Court of Caloocan City for non-payment of rentals. Petitioner Ignacio filed a motion to dismiss, arguing he was merely an employee of the business occupying the premises and not a lessee [1, 2]. The Municipal Court, presided by Judge Oreta, denied the motion to dismiss [3]. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Civil Case No. 6974), alleging the Municipal Court acted without jurisdiction [3]. On March 9, 1962, the CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Municipal Court acted within its jurisdiction [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court’s denial of the motion to dismiss constituted an error of jurisdiction reviewable by certiorari.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the CFI. The Municipal Court had undoubted jurisdiction over the ejectment case and the authority to decide the motion to dismiss [4].

The Court held that there is a distinction between "jurisdiction" and the "exercise of jurisdiction." Jurisdiction is the authority to hear and determine a cause. Any error committed in the exercise of this jurisdiction is merely an error of judgment [4]. The settled rule is that errors of jurisdiction may be corrected by certiorari, while errors of judgment may be reviewed only by appeal (*Henderson v. Tan*) [4]. Furthermore, an abuse of discretion justifies a writ of certiorari only if it is "grave and patent," meaning it was exercised arbitrarily or despotically [5]. In this case, the Municipal Court merely exercised its legitimate jurisdiction, and its action was not reviewable by certiorari [4].

**Order affirmed.**
