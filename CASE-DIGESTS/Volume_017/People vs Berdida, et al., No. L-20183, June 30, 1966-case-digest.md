I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EDUARDO BERDIDA Y INGUITO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20183, June 30, 1966, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On May 7, 1960, at around 10:00 P.M. in Tondo, Manila, Antonio Maravilla and Federico Cañalete were intercepted by appellants Eduardo Berdida, Loreto Saberon, Vicente Aberas, and Jesus Felicia, who identified themselves as detectives. Accusing the victims of killing a certain "Pabling," the group tied the victims' hands and dragged them to a spot near Pier 8. There, the appellants ordered the victims to dig their graves and severely beat them with wood and fists for several hours. Cañalete died from traumatic skull fractures, while Maravilla survived but sustained severe injuries.

The trial court convicted the appellants of Murder (imposing the death penalty) and Attempted Murder. The appellants raised the defense of alibi, claiming they were elsewhere assisting a neighbor or drinking. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review of the death penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and evident premeditation were correctly appreciated.
3. W/N the Supreme Court can review the judgment in the Attempted Murder case during the automatic review of the Murder case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi is worthless in the face of positive identification by prosecution witnesses pointing to the accused as participants in the crime. The surviving victim, Maravilla, positively identified the appellants, and his testimony was credible given he witnessed the atrocities before losing consciousness [1-3].

2. **YES.**
   *   **Nighttime:** Nighttime was not absorbed in treachery in this case. Treachery was based on the fact that the victims' hands were tied, while nighttime was purposely sought to execute the crime under cover of darkness. Since treachery rested on an independent factual basis, nighttime is perceived distinctly [2, 4, 5].
   *   **Evident Premeditation:** The appellants told the victims at the start that they were being taken for a past wrong (killing "Pabling"). The period from the abduction at 10:00 P.M. to the loss of consciousness at 1:00 A.M. afforded the offenders sufficient time to meditate and reflect on the consequences of their acts [6-8].

3. **NO.** Although the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over an attempted murder arising on the same occasion, it will not review the judgment in the attempted murder case if no appeal was interposed against it. The automatic review is limited to the death penalty case. Since the appellants did not perfect an appeal for the Attempted Murder conviction, that judgment became final [9-11].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **AFFIRMED**. The death penalty is imposed, and the indemnity to the heirs of Federico Cañalete is increased to P6,000 [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred [13].
