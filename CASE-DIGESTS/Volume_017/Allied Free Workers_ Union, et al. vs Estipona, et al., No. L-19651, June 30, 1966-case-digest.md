**I. CAPTION**
ALLIED FREE WORKERS' UNION (PLUM), SALVADOR T. LLUCH, MARIANO LL. BADELLES, NICANOR HALIBAS and LAURENTINO LL. BADELLES v. HON. JUDGE MANUEL ESTIPONA, THE SHERIFF OF ILIGAN CITY and THE COMPAÑIA MARITIMA OF ILIGAN CITY, G.R. No. L-19651, June 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 5, 1960, the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte (presided by respondent Judge Estipona) rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 577 in favor of respondent Compañia Maritima. The judgment terminated the stevedoring contract with petitioner Allied Free Workers’ Union (AFWU) and ordered AFWU and its officers to pay P520,000.00 in damages and attorney's fees [1-3].

Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration on December 17, 1960. While this was pending, they filed their Notice of Appeal and Appeal Bond on January 6, 1961, and their Record on Appeal on January 10, 1961 [4, 5]. On January 11, 1961, the respondent court *motu proprio* issued an "Amended Corrected Decision" to fix certain "errata and omissions" in the original judgment [5].

Respondent Compañia Maritima subsequently moved for execution, arguing that the "Amended Corrected Decision" of January 11, 1961, had superseded the December 5, 1960 decision. They claimed that since petitioners failed to appeal the *new* decision within the reglementary period, the judgment became final and executory [6]. On March 24, 1962, Judge Estipona issued an order adopting this view and directed the issuance of a writ of execution [7]. Petitioners filed this petition for certiorari to set aside the order and writ [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the "Amended Corrected Decision" issued *motu proprio* by the trial court superseded the original decision, thereby rendering the appeal taken from the original decision ineffective.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the "Amended Corrected Decision" did not supersede the original decision. A comparison of the two documents showed that the corrections made were not substantial in nature [9]. Even if they were substantial, the second decision could not have completely superseded the original one because it was served upon the parties only *after* the petitioners had already taken all the necessary steps to perfect their appeal (filing of Notice of Appeal, Appeal Bond, and Record on Appeal) against the original decision [9].

The Court characterized the respondent court's theory—that the amended decision required a new appeal—as a "preposterous claim" and a "futile technicality" that betrayed a desire to deprive petitioners of their right to appeal [9]. The proper procedure for the trial court would have been to simply require the petitioners to amend their Record on Appeal to incorporate the corrections, and then proceed to hear the approval of said record [9].

Petition granted. The Order of March 24, 1962, and the writ of execution are declared void. The respondent court is ordered to hold a hearing for the approval of the petitioners' Record on Appeal [10].
