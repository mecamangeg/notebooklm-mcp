I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARINCHO CASTILLO, ET AL., CARLOS CASTILLO (Appellant), G.R. No. L-19238, July 26, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1959, Juan Vargas was killed. While appellant Carlos Castillo was talking to Vargas, his son and co-accused, Marincho Castillo, attacked Vargas from behind and hacked him on the head. As Marincho was about to strike Vargas a second time, Carlos shouted, "You kill him" [1]. Although Carlos was armed with a revolver, he did not point it at the victim [2]. The prosecution alleged conspiracy, claiming witness Jose Ilagan saw the father and son walking fast and armed to hunt Vargas due to a slapping incident three months prior [1].

The Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro convicted both Carlos and Marincho of murder. Only Carlos appealed [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was conspiracy between the appellant and his son.
2. W/N the appellant is liable as a co-principal by inducement.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Conspiracy was not proven. The mere fact that the son attacked the victim while the father was talking to him is not sufficient proof of conspiracy [4]. The Court observed that the prior conflict occurred three months earlier, and the incident took place near the appellant's house, indicating the victim was the one who passed by rather than the accused seeking him out [5, 6].

2. **NO.** The appellant is not liable by inducement. To constitute liability as a co-principal by inducement, the utterance must be the determining cause of the crime and made with the intention of producing the result [7, 8]. Relying on *People v. Caimbre*, the Court held that since Carlos shouted "You kill him" only *after* his son had already fatally hacked the victim, the inducement was no longer necessary to cause the crime [2, 9].

The judgment is reversed and appellant Carlos Castillo is acquitted [10].
