I. CAPTION
ANDRES E. LAZARO v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. Nos. L-22511 and L-22343, May 16, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 24, 1954, Andres E. Lazaro (petitioner) imported packages of toothpicks, pomade, and dried fish fins into Manila. The shipment was not covered by any import license or release certificate from the Central Bank, as required by Central Bank (CB) Circulars Nos. 44 and 45. Consequently, the Commissioner of Customs forfeited the goods under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code in relation to said Circulars. The goods were released to Lazaro under a surety bond of P3,702.00. Subsequently, the Collector of Customs declared the bond forfeited. This decision was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). Lazaro appealed, arguing that Circulars 44 and 45 do not prescribe forfeiture as a penalty and that subsequent laws (CB Circular 133 and R.A. No. 1410) repealed said circulars, thereby abating the forfeiture.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the goods are subject to forfeiture for violating CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 despite the circulars not explicitly providing for such penalty.
2. W/N the subsequent issuance of CB Circular No. 133 or R.A. No. 1410 repealed Circulars 44 and 45 and abated the forfeiture case.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that while Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 do not expressly provide for forfeiture, they must be correlated with Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code. This provision authorizes the forfeiture of merchandise "the importation of which is effected contrary to law." The Court ruled that regulations issued pursuant to law, such as CB Circulars, form part of customs law. Therefore, an importation made without the necessary Central Bank license or release certificate is effected "contrary to law" and is subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) [1-3].

2. **NO.** Central Bank Circular No. 133 did not repeal Circulars 44 and 45 but rather re-enacted them by incorporating existing regulations not inconsistent with it [4]. Furthermore, forfeiture proceedings are civil in nature, not criminal, so the principle of abatement does not apply in the same manner [5, 6]. Regarding R.A. No. 1410, the Court ruled it cannot be given retroactive effect to defeat transactions undertaken during the life of Circular 45, pursuant to Article 4 of the Civil Code [7].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED.
