I. CAPTION
PRIMITIVO P. QUIEM v. JESUS SERIÑA, et al., G.R. No. L-22610, June 30, 1966, 17 SCRA 567, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On January 2, 1964, the Municipal Board of Cagayan de Oro City held an election for City Secretary with Petitioner Quiem and Respondent Abas as candidates. All eight (8) elective members (the Vice-Mayor and seven councilors) were present. The secret ballot resulted in three (3) votes for Quiem, three (3) for Abas, and one (1) blank ballot (abstention). Vice-Mayor Seriña, the presiding officer, then cast his vote for Quiem to break the tie, resulting in four (4) votes for Quiem. Quiem took his oath of office, but Respondent Abas challenged the election's validity. Quiem filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) to stop the Board from holding another election. The CFI dissolved the injunction and dismissed the petition, ruling that Quiem failed to secure the required majority vote. Quiem appealed, arguing denial of due process, that the Vice-Mayor is not a member of the Board, and that he obtained the necessary majority.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Vice-Mayor of Cagayan de Oro City is a member of the Municipal Board entitled to vote in the election of the City Secretary.
2. W/N Quiem was validly elected City Secretary based on the "majority vote of the elective... municipal board" required by law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Vice-Mayor is a member of the Municipal Board and is entitled to vote. The Cagayan de Oro City Charter (R.A. 521) expressly provides that the Vice-Mayor "shall be a member of the Municipal Board" [1]. While R.A. 2259 designated the Vice-Mayor as the "presiding officer," it did not repeal his membership in the Board; the two laws can be harmonized [2], [3]. Unlike the Charter of Manila interpreted in *Rivera v. Villegas*, which restricted the Vice-Mayor's vote to tie-breaking, the Cagayan de Oro Charter contains no such limitation [4]. Thus, the Vice-Mayor may exercise his right to vote as a member [5].

2. **NO.** Quiem failed to obtain the required number of votes. Section 5 of R.A. 2259 requires a "majority vote of the elective... municipal board" to elect a City Secretary [6]. Since the Board consists of eight (8) elective members, a majority of at least five (5) votes is necessary [6], [7]. Quiem only received four (4) votes (3 councilors + 1 Vice-Mayor). The blank ballot cannot be counted as a vote for Quiem or used to lower the threshold; under the Philippine system of elections, an abstention or blank ballot is a nullity and indicates a lack of intention to vote [8], [9]. Consequently, Quiem did not secure the confidence of the majority of the body [7].

The order of the lower court is affirmed [10].
