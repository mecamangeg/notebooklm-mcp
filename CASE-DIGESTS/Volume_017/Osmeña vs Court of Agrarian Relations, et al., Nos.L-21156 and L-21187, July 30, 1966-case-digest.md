I. CAPTION
LOURDES R. OSMEÑA v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, HON. VALERIANO A. DEL VALLE, LEONARDO QUIMA and FILOMENO OLDOG, G.R. Nos. L-21156 and L-21187, July 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lourdes R. Osmeña filed ejectment complaints against her tenants, respondents Quima and Oldog, for failure to pay rentals. On December 14, 1961, the parties signed an amicable settlement approved by the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The settlement required the tenants to pay arrears and rentals "on or before the harvest" of crop years 1961-62, 1962-63, and 1963-64 [1-3]. It expressly stipulated that upon failure to pay *any* installment, Osmeña was "immediately" entitled to ask for execution [2, 3].

On September 28, 1962, Osmeña filed motions for execution, alleging the tenants failed to pay the full rentals for the 1961-62 crop year [4]. The CAR denied the motions, ruling they were premature because the settlement covered crop years up to 1963-64, forcing Osmeña to wait until all specified crop years had passed before seeking execution [5]. Osmeña appealed to the Supreme Court on a question of law [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the landowner may enforce a writ of execution for the non-payment of 1961-62 rentals without awaiting the expiration of the subsequent crop years (1962-63 and 1963-64) stipulated in the compromise agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CAR orders. The Court reasoned that the plain terms of the amicable settlement entitled the petitioner to execution. The agreement specified that rentals were payable "on or before the harvest" of *each* respective crop year, and that upon failure to pay *any* installment, the landowner shall "immediately" be entitled to execution [7]. Since the failure to pay the 1961-62 rentals was admitted, Osmeña did not need to wait for the remaining crop years to pass [7].

The Court further held that a judgment rendered upon a compromise agreement is "more than a contract" and is "part and parcel of the judgment," which may be enforced by a writ of execution [8]. The Court relied on *Serrano v. Miave* (L-14678) in ruling that a violation of the compromise is not a new cause of action requiring a new suit, but a ground for execution [8].

The orders of the Court of Agrarian Relations denying the motions for execution were reversed, and the execution of the decision with respect to unpaid rentals for crop year 1961-62 was ordered [9].
