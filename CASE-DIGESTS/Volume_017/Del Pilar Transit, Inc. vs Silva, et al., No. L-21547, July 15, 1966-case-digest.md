I. CAPTION
DEL PILAR TRANSIT, INC. v. SILVA, et al., G.R. No. L-21547, July 15, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Jose M. Silva and Rodolfo M. Silva filed applications with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for certificates of public convenience to operate auto-trucks on routes connecting Muntinglupa/Alabang to Manila [1-3]. Petitioner Del Pilar Transit, Inc., along with others, opposed the applications [4]. The cases were jointly tried, and on March 19, 1963, the PSC rendered a decision granting the applications, finding the applicants financially sound and declaring that public convenience would be promoted by the additional lines [5].

Del Pilar Transit appealed, questioning the PSC's findings [6]. Specifically, petitioner argued that the finding of financial capacity was based merely on the applicants' "unrebutted testimonies" rather than the best documentary evidence [7]. Petitioner also questioned the finding of public necessity, arguing it relied on the testimony of a PSC inspector, Virgilio Celis, whom petitioner claimed was only authorized to make apprehensions, and a merchant, Neptalio Amoranto [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission's findings of financial capacity and public necessity are supported by substantial evidence despite relying on testimonial evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision.

On financial capacity, the Court ruled that the Public Service Commission is not bound by the strict rules of evidence [7]. While documentary evidence might have greater probative value, the unrebutted testimonies of the applicants regarding their assets and liabilities provided reasonable support for the Commission's findings [7, 10]. Such oral evidence is a sufficient basis for the findings, rendering them beyond the Court's power to disturb, citing *Redi Taxi, Inc. v. Santos* [7].

On public necessity, the Court reiterated the principle that PSC findings of fact should not be interfered with where some evidence reasonably supports them [8]. The Court found the record contained enough evidence—specifically the testimonies of the PSC inspector and the merchant regarding passenger volume and the irregularity of the petitioner's service—to warrant the conclusion of public necessity [8, 9]. The Court rejected the argument against the inspector's authority, noting his orders included checking the volume of passengers [9]. Factual findings may only be modified if it clearly appears there is no evidence to reasonably support them (*West Leyte Transportation Company v. Salazar*; *Halili v. Daplas*) [8, 9].

The decision of the Public Service Commission was affirmed [11].
