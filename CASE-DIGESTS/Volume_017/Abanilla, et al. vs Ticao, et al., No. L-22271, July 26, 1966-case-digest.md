I. CAPTION
JOSE ABANILLA, et al. v. REINERIO TICAO, et al., G.R. No. L-22271, July 26, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Jose Abanilla and others were permanent drivers and employees of the Iloilo City motor pool (Garage System). On March 31 and April 28, 1960, the Municipal Board of Iloilo City enacted Ordinance Nos. 27 and 29, respectively, which abolished the petitioners' positions in the Garage Fund Annual Budget citing "economy" as the reason [1, 2]. Consequently, petitioners were separated from service effective April 1, 1960 [3]. However, just two months later, the City Council passed Ordinance No. 43 creating ten new driver positions in the Office of the Mayor and the Police Department [2]. The petitioners were not reappointed to these new posts, while other employees with less tenure were retained or transferred to other offices [1, 4].

The Court of First Instance of Iloilo declared the abolition of the positions illegal, ruling that it was done in bad faith, and ordered the reinstatement of petitioners with back salaries [5, 6]. The respondents (City officials) appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the abolition of the petitioners' positions was done in bad faith and therefore illegal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the abolition of the positions was a "transparent device conceived to unseat incumbent petitioners" in violation of their security of tenure [4].

The Court found the defense of "economy" to be false and contrary to the truth [7]. Evidence showed that at the time of the abolition, there was an available surplus in the budget [3]. Furthermore, the subsequent creation of ten new driver positions shortly after abolishing the petitioners' items, alongside a budget increase creating 142 other positions, negated the claim of financial necessity [3, 7]. The Court also rejected the argument that the motor pool was operating at a loss, noting that government offices are established for service, not profit [7].

Since the removal was in bad faith, the petitioners are entitled to restoration and back salaries. Courts are duty-bound to honor the constitutionally protected security of tenure in the observance, not in the breach [8].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Castro concurred with the decision [9].
