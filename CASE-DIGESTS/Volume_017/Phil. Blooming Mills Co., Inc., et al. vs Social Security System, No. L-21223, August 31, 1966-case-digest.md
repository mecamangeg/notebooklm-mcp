**I. CAPTION**
PHILIPPINE BLOOMING MILLS CO., INC., et al. v. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-21223, August 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
Philippine Blooming Mills Co., Inc. (PBM) employed six Japanese technicians from April 1957 to October 1958 under pre-arranged employment contracts. PBM inquired with the Social Security System (SSS) regarding their coverage, and the SSS Assistant Administrator confirmed that aliens employed in the Philippines are compulsorily covered, but noted that temporary alien employees were entitled to a rebate of proportionate contributions upon departure under the existing Rules and Regulations [1-3]. PBM and the technicians paid premium contributions totaling P2,520.00 [4].

On January 14, 1958, the President approved amendments to the SSS Rules, eliminating the rebate provision for temporary aliens and requiring at least two years of membership for a refund of premiums [5, 6]. These amendments were published in the Official Gazette in November 1958 [7]. When the technicians’ employment ended in October 1958, they filed a claim for refund, which the SSS denied based on the amended rules [4]. PBM petitioned the Social Security Commission, arguing that membership created a contractual relationship protected against impairment and that the amendments were ineffective against them due to late publication [7, 8]. The Commission denied the petition [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N membership in the SSS creates a contractual relationship protected by the non-impairment clause.
2. W/N the amended SSS Rules requiring two years of membership for refunds applied to the petitioners despite being published after their employment ceased.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** Membership in the SSS is not the result of a bilateral, consensual agreement where rights and obligations are subject to the will of the parties. It is a legal imposition under Republic Act 1161 designed to provide social security to workingmen. Consequently, membership is a lawful exercise of the police power of the State, to which the principle of non-impairment of the obligation of contracts is not a proper defense [8].

2. **YES.** Under Article 2 of the Civil Code, the date of publication in the Official Gazette determines effectivity only if the statute itself does not provide otherwise. The original SSS Rules specifically provided that any subsequent amendments would take effect on the date of their approval by the President [9]. Since the amendments were approved by the President on January 14, 1958, they were already effective when the technicians separated in October 1958, regardless of the delayed publication in November 1958 [7, 9]. The applicable rule was therefore Rule IX of the amended Rules, which requires two years of membership for a premium refund [9].

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is AFFIRMED [10].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
J.B.L. Reyes reserved his vote. Regala, J. took no part [10].
