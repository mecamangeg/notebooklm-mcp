I. CAPTION
POTENCIANO ILUSORIO and TERESA ILUSORIO v. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, PASCUAL MANALILI, et al., G.R. No. L-20344, May 16, 1966, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Potenciano and Teresa Ilusorio were co-owners of a parcel of land in San Miguel, Bulacan, which the respondent tenants cultivated under a share tenancy system. Before the start of the 1960–1961 agricultural year, the tenants notified the petitioners of their desire to change their tenancy relationship from share tenancy to leasehold tenancy, pursuant to Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (The Agricultural Tenancy Act). The petitioners refused, contending that the provision was unconstitutional. The tenants subsequently filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). The CAR rejected the petitioners' defense of unconstitutionality and fixed the lease rentals based on the average harvest of the three preceding agricultural years. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Section 14 violates the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of contracts and that the CAR acted arbitrarily in fixing the rentals.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 is unconstitutional for impairing the obligation of contracts.
2. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations acted arbitrarily in fixing the rentals based on the average harvest of the three preceding years rather than on a year-to-year basis.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts is not absolute and is not to be read with mathematical exactness. It does not prevent the proper exercise by the State of its police powers to enact regulations reasonably necessary for the general welfare (*Ongsiako v. Gamboa*). R.A. 1199 is remedial legislation promulgated pursuant to the social justice precepts of the Constitution to regulate the relations between landlord and tenant (*Primero v. Court of Agrarian Relations*). Consequently, Section 14, which allows tenants to change the nature of their tenancy relationship, is constitutional and within the domain of the State's general legislative powers.

2. **NO.** The Court of Agrarian Relations did not act arbitrarily. Section 46(a) of R.A. 1199, as amended by R.A. 2263, explicitly provides that the fixed consideration for the use of ricelands is based on the "average gross produce... of the past three normal harvests." The law mandates this method of calculation, refuting the petitioners' claim that rentals should be determined on a year-to-year basis.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
