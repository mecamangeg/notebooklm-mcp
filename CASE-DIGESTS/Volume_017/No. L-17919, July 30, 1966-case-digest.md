I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF LIM QUICO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. GO IM TY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-17919, July 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Lim Quico filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Cebu on February 20, 1958 [1]. However, Lim Quico died on November 13, 1959, before the expiration of the two-year probationary period required by Republic Act No. 530 [2]. His widow, Go Im Ty, filed a motion to continue the proceedings under Section 16 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 473 [2]. The lower court allowed the proceedings and eventually ordered the registration of citizenship for Go Im Ty and her minor children, ruling that she was not disqualified [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the widow must independently prove she possesses the qualifications for citizenship, which she failed to do as she could not speak English or Spanish and lacked proof of a lucrative trade [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the widow of a deceased petitioner automatically acquires Filipino citizenship upon the approval of the continued petition without proving her own qualifications.
2. W/N the failure to state the street and number of a former residence in the petition is a fatal defect.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that while Section 16 of C.A. No. 473 allows a widow to continue the proceedings, a favorable decision does not automatically vest citizenship upon her and the children [6]. Under Section 15 of C.A. No. 473, an alien woman married to a Filipino citizen must show she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [7]. This requires proof that she possesses all the qualifications under Section 2 and none of the disqualifications under Section 4 of the Naturalization Law [8], [9]. Go Im Ty failed to present evidence of her own qualifications, such as language proficiency and lucrative trade [10], [5].

2. **YES.** The Court found the original petition fatally defective because it failed to state the street and house number of Lim Quico's former residence in Manila, where he lived for 19 years [11]. Non-compliance with Section 7 of C.A. No. 473 regarding the publication of residence is sufficient ground for denial [11]. Naturalization cases are open for review in their entirety on appeal, even if a specific objection was not raised in the lower court [11].

The decision and order were REVERSED [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
