I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEVERO CORONEL, G.R. No. L-19091, June 30, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On September 7, 1947, accused Severo Coronel, conspiring with others in an armed band, broke into the house of Judge Basilio Bautista in Malabon, Rizal. They stole personal properties valued at P1,360.00 and, on the occasion of the robbery, killed Judge Bautista, his son Crispin, and three MPC soldiers who came to their aid [1, 2]. Coronel surrendered in 1954 and was charged with the complex crime of robbery with multiple homicide [3, 4].

During the continuation of his trial, Coronel entered a plea of guilty but invoked mercy, arguing that the crime was committed in furtherance of the Hukbalahap rebellion movement and thus he should be charged with rebellion under Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Rizal rejected this contention, finding him guilty of the crime charged and imposing the death penalty [3, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is liable for rebellion instead of robbery with multiple homicide.
2. W/N the plea of guilty constitutes a mitigating circumstance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** When an accused pleads guilty, he admits the truth of all allegations in the information. The information specifically charged "Robbery with Multiple Homicide" without alleging that the acts were committed in furtherance of rebellion [5]. Furthermore, robbery is not an essential element or ingredient of the crime of rebellion. The Court held that robbery cannot be countenanced as necessary for the commission of the political crime of rebellion; thus, the crime is punishable as robbery with homicide under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code [5].

2. **NO.** A plea of guilty acts as a mitigating circumstance only when made prior to the presentation of evidence. Since Coronel entered his plea only during the continuation of the trial, it cannot mitigate his liability under the law [7, 8].

However, the Court recognized the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and noted that the plea indicated a disposition to reform. Due to the lack of sufficient votes to affirm the death penalty, the decision was **MODIFIED**, and the penalty changed to life imprisonment [8, 9].
