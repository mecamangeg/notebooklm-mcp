I. CAPTION
CRISTINA CHINGAN v. GABRIEL LA GUARDIA and HON. TOMAS P. PANGANIBAN, G.R. No. L-20739, June 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On October 11, 1961, respondent Gabriel La Guardia, a tenant, filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) against petitioner Cristina Chingan, the landholder, for reliquidation of past harvests [1]. Chingan admitted the tenancy status but claimed she owned only half of the land [1].

Chingan and her counsel failed to appear at the initial hearings on December 13, 1961, and January 17, 1962 [2]. The CAR allowed La Guardia to present evidence *ex-parte* but later reopened the case upon Chingan's motion [2, 3]. The hearing was reset to June 8, 1962, but Chingan again failed to appear [2]. The CAR received evidence *ex-parte* and rendered a decision on September 7, 1962 [2]. Chingan filed a motion for reconsideration/reopening, alleging she only received notice of the June 8 hearing on June 14, 1962 [2]. However, her motion was not accompanied by an affidavit of merit [2]. The CAR denied the motion, prompting this petition for review [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to reopen the case due to the petitioner's alleged failure to receive timely notice.
2. W/N the petitioner's special defense of limited ownership over the land is meritorious.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the denial was proper on two grounds. First, the petitioner's negligence was not excusable. She had failed to appear on two previous occasions, and even assuming she received the notice late on June 14, 1962, she took no steps to inquire about the case until the decision was rendered three months later [3]. Second, a motion for new trial based on such grounds must be supported by an affidavit of merit as a condition *sine qua non* under Section 2, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court [4, 5]. The petitioner's failure to attach said affidavit was fatal to her cause, and the trial court correctly refused to reopen the case [5].

2. **NO.** The Court found the defense devoid of merit as it was not substantiated by evidence [6]. The record clearly established a tenancy relationship solely between the petitioner and the respondent [6]. It was proven that Chingan took La Guardia as a tenant and was the only one sharing the produce with him from the inception of their relationship; thus, her claim of owning only half the land did not absolve her liability [6-8].

The petition is DENIED, and the decision is AFFIRMED [8].
