I. CAPTION
MARIA MAHILUM, SALVADOR MAHILUM, ANGEL MAHILUM, EMILIO OGDIMAN, VICTORIO SALAZAR and TOMAS SALAZAR vs. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and GORGONIA FLORA DE SOTES, G.R. No. L-17970, June 30, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Gorgonia Flora de Sotes filed an action for partition and damages against petitioners (heirs of Pedro Mahilum) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental regarding Lot No. 2195. Respondent claimed she bought a portion of the lot from the petitioners in 1935 via a "Deed of Definite Sale" (Exhibit "D"). Petitioners denied the sale, arguing that their Original Certificate of Title (OCT No. RO-6024) was free from encumbrances. The CFI dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the CFI, declaring respondent the rightful owner of the purchased portion based on the deed. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Exhibit "D" was inadmissible because the duplicate copy lacked documentary stamps and the original was not accounted for. They further argued the deed was invalid because the notary public signed as a witness, and that their clean Torrens title was conclusive evidence of ownership [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the deed of sale (Exhibit "D") is admissible in evidence despite being a duplicate copy without documentary stamps.
2. W/N the deed of sale is valid despite the notary public signing as one of the attesting witnesses.
3. W/N the unregistered deed of sale is binding on the petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Exhibit "D" is admissible. It is a "duplicate original," being a signed carbon copy executed at the same time as the original, and thus may be introduced without accounting for the non-production of the original [6]. Regarding the stamps, the Court ruled that documentary stamps required by Section 238 of the Internal Revenue Code are practically affixed to the original, not the duplicates. Absent evidence to the contrary, the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed and that the regular course of business has been followed applies (Sec. 69[q], Rule 123; now Sec. 5, Rule 131) [7], [8].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the requirement of two witnesses under Section 127 of Act 496 was complied with. There is nothing in the law prohibiting the notary public who ratified the document from also signing it in the capacity of a witness [9], [6].

3. **YES.** The Court held that while the deed was not registered, it remains binding on the parties and their privies (the petitioners, who are heirs of the registered owner). The petitioners delivered possession to the respondent and no superior rights of third persons intervened. An unregistered sale of registered land is valid between the parties [10], [11].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED [12].
