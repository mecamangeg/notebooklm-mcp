I. CAPTION
REMEDIOS NUGUID v. FELIX NUGUID and PAZ SALONGA NUGUID, G.R. No. L-23445, June 23, 1966, 17 SCRA 449, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Rosario Nuguid died single and without descendants, survived by her parents, Felix and Paz Nuguid, and six siblings [1]. She left a holographic will dated November 17, 1951, which instituted her sister, petitioner Remedios Nuguid, as her sole universal heir to all her properties [2]. The will completely omitted her parents, who are compulsory heirs in the direct ascending line [3]. Remedios filed a petition to probate the will in the Court of First Instance of Rizal [4]. The parents opposed the probate and moved to dismiss the petition on the ground of absolute preterition [4, 5]. The trial court held that the will was a complete nullity due to preterition and dismissed the petition [5]. Remedios appealed, arguing that the omission should be treated as ineffective disinheritance, which would not entirely annul the institution of heir but only reduce it to the extent of the legitime [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the omission of the parents in the will constitutes preterition that renders the institution of the petitioner as universal heir void.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the order of the lower court. The omission of the parents, who are forced heirs in the direct ascending line, constitutes preterition under Article 854 of the Civil Code, not ineffective disinheritance [3, 6]. Disinheritance is a voluntary testamentary disposition depriving a heir of their legitime for a legal cause, whereas preterition is the presumed involuntary omission of a forced heir [6].

The Court held that under Article 854, preterition "shall annul the institution of heir" [8]. This annulment is *in toto* (total), resulting in the complete abrogation of the will, unless there are specific legacies or devises that are not inofficious [3, 9]. In this case, the will contained only the institution of Remedios as universal heir and no specific legacies or bequests [9, 10]. Consequently, the universal institution of the petitioner is void, the will is a complete nullity, and intestate succession ensues [9, 11]. The Court rejected the argument to treat the institution as a legacy or betterment, stating that doing so would render the statutory distinction between preterition (total annulment) and ineffective disinheritance (partial annulment) meaningless [12, 13].

Although probate proceedings generally limit inquiry to extrinsic validity, the Court ruled on the intrinsic validity of the will because the defect was patent and remanding the case would only result in a waste of time and effort [14, 15].

The order of the lower court declaring the will a complete nullity is affirmed [16].
