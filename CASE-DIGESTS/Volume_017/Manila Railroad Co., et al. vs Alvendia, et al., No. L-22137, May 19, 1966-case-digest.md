I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE v. HONORABLE CARMELINO ALVENDIA and BATAAN REFINING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-22137, May 19, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila rendered a decision ordering petitioners Manila Railroad Company (MRR) and Manila Port Service (MPS) to pay respondent Bataan Refining Corporation the sum of P1,140.24. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal accompanied by an appeal bond. However, the bond was executed and signed only by MPS (through its Manager) and the surety, Standard Insurance Co., Inc. [1]. The trial court rejected the record on appeal and declared the decision final as to MRR for failure to file its own appeal bond [1]. Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus*, arguing that since MPS is a mere subsidiary without a separate legal personality, the bond it filed should be considered a bond for MRR [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal bond executed solely by the Manila Port Service is valid and binding on the Manila Railroad Company.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the petition for *mandamus* [3]. The mere recital in the bond stating "We, Manila Railroad Company, et al." is insufficient to bind MRR absent any signature or authorization from the company empowering MPS to execute the bond on its behalf [2]. Furthermore, since the petitioners admitted that MPS has no legal personality and cannot be considered a juridical person, the bond is void and unenforceable for lack of a principal debtor [4]. The surety's undertaking to pay jointly and severally presupposes the existence of a principal obligation enforceable against someone else [4]. Consequently, the trial court correctly declared the judgment final against MRR for failure to file an appeal bond in due time [3].
