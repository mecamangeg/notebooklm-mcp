I. CAPTION
A.L. AMMEN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., ET AL. v. FROILAN JAPA, G.R. No. L-19643, July 26, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Froilan Japa applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate eight TPU buses on the Legaspi-Naga City line. Petitioners (A.L. Ammen Transportation, Bicol Transportation, and Consolidated Auto Line), who operated buses on the same route under joint management, opposed the application. They argued that they already provided adequate service and that granting the application would result in ruinous competition.

During the trial, Japa presented evidence that passengers were frequently left behind by petitioners' buses due to lack of space. He also established his financial capacity with assets worth P188,000, including stores and bank deposits. The PSC ruled in favor of Japa but authorized only four units instead of eight. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the appeal, petitioners filed a motion to admit "newly discovered evidence" documents showing that Japa had failed to pay installments on his buses and that civil actions had been filed against him.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court should disturb the Public Service Commission's factual findings regarding public necessity and the applicant's financial capacity.
2. W/N the Supreme Court can consider "newly discovered evidence" regarding the applicant's financial status presented for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court is not required to examine the proof *de novo* to determine the preponderance of evidence. Its only function in reviewing a PSC decision is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence before the Commission upon which its decision can reasonably be based [1, 2]. The record showed ample evidence supporting the Commission's findings that the proposed service would promote public interest and that Japa was financially capable of operating the four authorized units [3].

2. **NO.** The Court cannot admit or consider evidence presented only on appeal. To do so would require evaluating evidence that the trial court (the Commission) did not have before it. The Supreme Court cannot declare that the Commission abused its discretion for failing to evaluate evidence it could not have foreseen [4]. The review must be strictly limited to the evidence presented before the Commission [5].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
