I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WADHU PRIBHDAS SHAHANI TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. WADHU PRIBHDAS SHAHANI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19451, July 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 18, 1960, Wadhu Pribhdas Shahani, a subject of India, filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo [1]. After the notice of hearing was published, one of his character witnesses, Felipe Ysmael, died [1]. Shahani moved to substitute Jose Ma. Vallejo in place of the deceased witness [1]. The City Fiscal, representing the Solicitor General, consented to the substitution subject to the condition that the petition, with the new witness's affidavit, be published anew [1]. However, the lower court allowed the substitution without requiring a new publication [2]. The Republic objected, arguing that substitution constituted a substantial amendment requiring republication, but the lower court proceeded to trial and rendered judgment admitting Shahani to Philippine citizenship [2, 3]. The Republic appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in allowing the substitution of a deceased character witness without requiring a new publication of the petition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court committed a reversible error in allowing the substitution without requiring a new publication, contrary to the condition under which the City Fiscal gave his assent [3]. The Fiscal’s conditional consent implied that the State needed sufficient time to gather and check information regarding the credibility of the substitute witness and his relations to the petitioner [3]. By dispensing with the new publication, the State was deprived of this opportunity [3].

The Court distinguished this case from *Pe v. Republic* (52 O.G. 5855). In *Pe*, the substitute witness was the Provincial Governor, a widely known person, and there was no showing that the government's representative had imposed a condition for the substitution [3]. In the present case, the Fiscal expressly required a new publication [3].

The decision appealed from is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for corresponding additional proceedings [5].
