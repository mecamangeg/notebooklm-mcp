I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ONG CHUAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, ONG CHUAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19268, June 23, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 6, 1960, Petitioner Ong Chuan, a subject of Nationalist China residing in Manila, filed a petition for naturalization [1]. He claimed to be a merchant with a net annual income of approximately P5,000 [1]. However, the evidence presented showed that his actual income for the years 1957 to 1960 was only slightly over P5,000, P1,400, P2,000, and P4,000, respectively [2, 3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila denied the petition on the grounds that Ong Chuan failed to prove he had a lucrative trade or occupation, that he conducted himself in an irreproachable manner, or that his witness was credible [4]. Ong Chuan appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner satisfied the requirement of having a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that an annual net income of P5,000 does not constitute a lucrative business or occupation [3]. The Court relied on the doctrine established in *Keng Giok v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-13347), which sets the standard for economic qualifications in naturalization cases [3]. The petitioner's failure to meet this requirement was further evidenced by his own proof of income, which dropped as low as P1,400 and P2,000 in the years immediately preceding his application [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [5].
