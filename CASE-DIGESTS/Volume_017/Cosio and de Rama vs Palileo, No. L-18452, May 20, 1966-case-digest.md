I. CAPTION
AUGUSTO COSIO and BEATRIZ DE RAMA v. CHERIE PALILEO, G.R. No. L-18452, May 20, 1966 (Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration) and November 28, 1966 (Resolution on Second Motion for Reconsideration), Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Cherie Palileo obtained a P12,000 loan from petitioner Beatriz Cosio de Rama, secured by a document titled "Conditional Sale of Residential Building" executed on December 18, 1951. Palileo remained in possession. After a fire destroyed the house in 1952, Cosio de Rama collected insurance proceeds, took possession of the property, and rebuilt the house at her own expense (P12,000). In a previous case (*Palileo v. Cosio*, 97 Phil. 919), the Supreme Court ruled the transaction was an equitable mortgage, not a sale. In the present case, the Court originally declared petitioners possessors in bad faith liable for rentals. Petitioners filed Motions for Reconsideration, arguing they had a right to possession as mortgagees or, alternatively, were in good faith because they honestly believed the contract was a sale and they were the owners.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are possessors in bad faith liable for rentals on the property.

IV. RULING
**YES, but only from December 15, 1955.**
While a simple mortgage does not give the mortgagee a right to possession [1], and a transaction is determined by its nature regardless of title [2], the Court recognized that a mistake upon a difficult question of law may be the basis of good faith (Civil Code, Art. 526) [3]. Giving the petitioners the benefit of the doubt, the Court held they were possessors in good faith acting under the honest belief that the "conditional sale" entitled them to possession [3]. Their bad faith—and the consequent liability for rent—began only when the decision in the first case (*Palileo v. Cosio*) became final on December 15, 1955, as it was from that date they became aware of the flaw in their title (Civil Code, Art. 528) [3].

The Court modified the judgment: Petitioners are ordered to pay monthly rentals of P300 starting from December 15, 1955, but petitioner Cosio de Rama is entitled to be reimbursed for necessary expenses (reconstruction) in the amount of P12,000, which may be deducted from the rents due [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Makalintal, J. (Dissenting):**
Argued that petitioners should not be liable for any rents. He maintained that petitioners' possession was in good faith throughout, consistent with the agreement and the reconstruction of the house. He posited that awarding rents enriches the respondent (a defaulting debtor) at the expense of the petitioners who used their own funds to rebuild the property [5], [6].
