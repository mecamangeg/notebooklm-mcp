I. CAPTION
NATY BALTAZAR, ET AL. v. SILVINA CARIDAD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23509, June 23, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 23, 1941, the trial court in a cadastral proceeding awarded Lot No. 8864 to spouses Julio Baltazar and Constancia Valencia [1]. The decision became final and the decree of registration was issued on July 12, 1941 [1]. Respondents Silvina Caridad and her daughter Eduarda had been in possession of the southern portion of the lot since 1939, during the pendency of the cadastral case [2].

After Julio Baltazar died, his heirs (petitioners) filed a motion for a writ of possession on December 6, 1961, which the trial court granted [2, 3]. The sheriff placed petitioners in possession on January 2, 1962 [3]. Subsequently, petitioners filed a motion to compel respondents to remove the houses they had built on the lot in 1958 and 1959 [3]. Respondents opposed, arguing that the cadastral court lacked jurisdiction to order demolition long after the final decree and that they were builders in good faith entitled to rights under Article 448 of the Civil Code [4]. They contended that petitioners should file a separate ordinary action for ejectment [5]. The trial court ordered the removal of the houses, prompting this appeal [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance, sitting as a land registration court, has jurisdiction to order the demolition of improvements introduced by the defeated oppositor's successors.
2. W/N the respondents are builders in good faith.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of First Instance, sitting as a land registration court, has jurisdiction to order the demolition of improvements as a consequence of the writ of possession issued by it [6]. Citing *Marcelo v. Mencias*, the Court held that the Rules of Court apply to land registration cases in a suppletory character [6, 7]. Under Section 6, Rule 124, when jurisdiction is conferred on a court, all auxiliary writs, processes, and means necessary to carry it into effect may be employed [8]. A writ of demolition is a necessary complement to a writ of possession; otherwise, the latter would be ineffective [7]. Requiring a successful litigant to institute a separate civil action for ejectment would be cumbersome and foster multiplicity of suits [9].

2. **NO.** Respondents cannot be regarded as builders in good faith because they are bound by the 1941 decree of registration that obligated their predecessors-in-interest [10]. Good faith must rest on a "colorable right" in the builder, beyond a mere stubborn belief in one's title despite judicial adjudication [10]. The fact that respondents demolished and replaced their old houses with new ones in 1959 cannot enervate the rights of the registered owners; otherwise, the owners' rights could be indefinitely defeated by the simple subterfuge of replacing structures from time to time [10, 11].

The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED [11].
