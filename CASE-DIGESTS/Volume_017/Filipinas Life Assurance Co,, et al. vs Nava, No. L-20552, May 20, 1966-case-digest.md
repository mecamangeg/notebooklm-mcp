I. CAPTION
FILIPINAS LIFE ASSURANCE CO., ET AL. v. GONZALO P. NAVA, G.R. No. L-20552, May 20, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Gonzalo P. Nava held 18 life insurance policies issued by petitioners Filipinas Life Assurance Co. and Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. entered into before WWII. Each policy contained a specific "Policy Loans" clause allowing the insured to obtain a loan against the policy's cash value after three full years of premium payments. Nava paid the premiums before the war and during the Japanese Occupation using fiat currency, totaling P34,646.60.

On April 28, 1948, Nava applied for a P5,000.00 loan under the policies. Petitioners refused, citing May 1946 regulations from the Insurance Commissioner which required withholding payments made in fiat currency subject to future adjustments. Nava pointed out the Supreme Court's decision in *Haw Pia v. China Banking Corp.* (1948), which recognized the validity of occupation payments, but petitioners still refused the loan. Consequently, Nava filed an action for rescission of the policies and refund of premiums. The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Nava, ordering rescission and full refund. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners' refusal to grant the loan was justified by the Insurance Commissioner's regulations.
2. W/N the violation of the loan clause entitles the insured to rescind the insurance contracts.
3. W/N the insured is entitled to a full refund of all premiums paid rather than just the cash surrender value.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The refusal was unjustified. The Supreme Court held that the ruling in *Haw Pia v. China Banking Corp.* settled that payments made in Japanese military notes for pre-war contractual obligations are valid for all legal intents and purposes. The Court rejected the petitioners' argument that the insured is not a "debtor," ruling that an insurance policy involves a contractual obligation where the insured is duty-bound to pay premiums. Therefore, the occupation payments were valid, and the administrative regulations could not excuse the petitioners from complying with the loan clause [1], [2].

2. **YES.** The violation of the loan clause entitles the respondent to rescind. Section 69 of the Insurance Act provides that "The violation of a material warranty, or other material provision of a policy, on the part of either party thereto, entitles the other to rescind." The Court found the loan clause to be a material provision of the policy [3].

3. **YES.** The respondent is entitled to a full refund of premiums. Since the Insurance Law does not expressly provide for the consequences of rescission under Section 69, the Court applied Article 1295 of the old Civil Code (suppletory application per Article 16). Article 1295 mandates the return of the "price paid, with interest thereon." This aligns with the majority rule in American jurisprudence that an insured may recover all premiums paid in cases of wrongful rescission or repudiation by the insurer. The Court rejected the "cash surrender value" theory (minority rule), noting that petitioners cannot claim unfairness as they had derived material benefits from the use of the premiums [4], [5].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.
