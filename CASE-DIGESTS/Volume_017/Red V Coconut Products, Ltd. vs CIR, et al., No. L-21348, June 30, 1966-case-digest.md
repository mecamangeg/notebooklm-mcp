I. CAPTION
RED V COCONUT PRODUCTS, LTD. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, TANGLAW NG PAGGAWA, ALBERTO DELA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21348, June 30, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Red V Coconut Products, Ltd. entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with respondent union Tanglaw ng Paggawa, providing for night shift differentials. The company's workers were divided into two groups: Group A (three shifts) and Group B (two 12-hour shifts: 4 A.M. to 4 P.M. and 4 P.M. to 4 A.M.) [1]. Group B workers filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) claiming that while they received P0.55 differential for the night shift, they were entitled to P0.90 (the combined rate of the 2nd and 3rd shifts of Group A) because they worked 12 hours covering both shift periods [1]. The company moved to dismiss, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction as it was a simple money claim [2]. The CIR denied the motion, ruling the claim was for overtime pay of employees still employed [3]. After trial, the CIR found the workers were engaged on a *pakiao* or piece-work basis but ordered the payment of the deficiency in differentials [4]. The company appealed, arguing the workers were piece-workers excluded from the Eight-Hour Labor Law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the claim.
2. W/N the workers, despite being piece-workers, are entitled to the shift differentials under the Eight-Hour Labor Law.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the petition or complaint. The petition clearly asserted that the laborers were currently working for the company in shifts of approximately 12 hours each [6]. Thus, it was properly regarded as a claim for overtime pay by workers still employed by the company, falling within CIR jurisdiction [6]. Although evidence adduced during trial showed they were piece-workers, this does not affect jurisdiction because jurisdiction once acquired continues until final adjudication [7].

2. **YES.** While the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Sec. 2, Com. Act 444) excludes workers who prefer to be paid on a piece-work basis, nothing precludes an agreement for overtime compensation [8]. By agreeing to pay differentials in the CBA and actually paying them, the company freely adhered to the application of the law [8]. Furthermore, the workers do not fall under the full concept of piece-workers because their work hours (12 hours per shift) are fixed by the employer [9]. As held in *Lara v. Del Rosario*, the philosophy behind excluding piece-workers is that they work "irrespective of the amount of time employed." Since the petitioners' time was controlled by the employer, they are within the scope of the law regarding compensation for work in excess of eight hours [9].

The decision and resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations are affirmed [10].
