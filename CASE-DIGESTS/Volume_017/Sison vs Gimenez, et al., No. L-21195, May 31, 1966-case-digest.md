I. CAPTION
NANCY Q. SISON, as Vice-Governor of Pangasinan v. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ, as Auditor General, JORGE AMBROSIO, as Provincial Auditor of Pangasinan, and LICERIO P. SENDAYDIEGO, as Provincial Treasurer of Pangasinan, G.R. No. L-21195, May 31, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Nancy Q. Sison was the elected Vice-Governor of Pangasinan but vacated the post to run for Congress in the 1961 elections [1]. After losing her bid, the President of the Nacionalista Party recommended her on December 7, 1961, to fill the vacancy pursuant to Section 21(b) of the Revised Election Code [1, 2]. President Garcia extended an *ad interim* appointment to her on December 29, 1961, and she qualified and assumed office the same day [1].

Subsequently, newly-elected President Macapagal issued Proclamation No. 2, withdrawing and declaring without effect all *ad interim* appointments released by President Garcia after December 13, 1961 (known as "midnight appointments") [3]. Based on this, Auditor General Gimenez denied Sison's claim for per diems and allowances for the period of January 2 to May 4, 1962 [3, 4]. Sison filed a petition for *mandamus* before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan, which ruled in her favor [4, 5]. The Auditor General appealed, arguing Sison's appointment was ineffective under the *Aytona v. Castillo* ruling regarding midnight appointments [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Sison's *ad interim* appointment was valid and effective despite Proclamation No. 2 and the ban on midnight appointments.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [7].

The Court held that the ruling in *Aytona v. Castillo* did not categorically declare Proclamation No. 2 valid nor all so-called "midnight appointments" invalid [8]. The *Aytona* decision was influenced by the "doubtful character" and "hurried maneuvers" attending the rush of appointments in that specific case [8].

In this case, Sison's appointment was regular and not a "rush appointment." She was recommended by her political party on December 7, 1961—well before the December 13 cutoff usually associated with controversial midnight appointments—in strict compliance with Section 21(b) of the Revised Election Code [2]. Furthermore, she was fully qualified, having previously occupied the post by election, and was even later reappointed to the same position by President Macapagal himself [2]. Since her appointment lacked the irregularities envisioned in *Aytona*, she had a valid title to the office and is entitled to the corresponding rights and privileges [2].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
