I. CAPTION
NICANOR T. JIMENEZ, ET AL. v. BARTOLOME CABANGBANG, G.R. No. L-15905, August 3, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Nicanor T. Jimenez, et al., officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, filed a civil action for damages against Defendant Bartolome Cabangbang, a member of the House of Representatives and Chairman of its Committee on National Defense [1], [2]. The suit stemmed from an open letter Cabangbang wrote to the President, published in several newspapers on November 14, 1958, alleging "operational plans" for a coup d'etat involving the plaintiffs [3], [4]. At the time of publication, Congress was not in session [3]. Cabangbang moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing the letter was not libelous and was a privileged communication. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, sustaining Cabangbang's defenses [1]. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the open letter published by the defendant Congressman is a privileged communication under Article VI, Section 15 of the Constitution.
2. W/N the publication is libelous and sufficient to support an action for damages.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The publication is not privileged. The constitutional protection for "speech or debate therein" (Article VI, Section 15) refers to utterances made by Congressmen in the performance of their official functions, such as speeches or votes in Congress while in session, or acts of duly authorized Congressional Committees [5]. The open letter was published when Congress was not in session, and the defendant was not performing his official duty as a member of Congress or any Committee when he caused its publication [3]. The Court cited *Vera v. Avelino*, *Tenney v. Brandhove*, and *Coffin v. Coffin* to define the scope of the privilege [5].

2. **NO.** The letter is not sufficient to support an action for damages. While the letter alleged plaintiffs were under the control of "planners" of a coup, it explicitly stated: "It is, of course, possible that the officers mentioned above are *unwitting tools* of the plan of which they may have *absolutely no knowledge*" [6]. This statement indicates the plaintiffs might be absolutely unaware of the alleged plans, rendering the publication not derogatory to the point of entitling them to recover damages [7].

The Order of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [8].
