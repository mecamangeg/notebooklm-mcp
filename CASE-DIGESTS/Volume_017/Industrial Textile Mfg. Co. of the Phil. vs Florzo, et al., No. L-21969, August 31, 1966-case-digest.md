I. CAPTION
INDUSTRIAL TEXTILE MANUFACTURING COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SOFIA REYES FLORZO and THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-21969, August 31, 1966, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Ricardo Florzo was employed by petitioner Industrial Textile Manufacturing Company (Itemcop) as a beam carrier. His work involved replacing empty loom beams with fully loaded ones weighing 15 to 30 kilos, lifting about 20 to 30 beams daily over an 8-hour shift. On March 5, 1960, Florzo fell ill and stopped working; he died on March 20, 1960, due to anemia secondary to hemorrhagic gastric ulcer. Itemcop had actual knowledge of his sickness and death on the dates they occurred but did not report the injury or controvert liability within the statutory period.

On May 3, 1961, Florzo’s mother, respondent Sofia Reyes Florzo, filed a claim for compensation. It was only on May 23, 1961, that Itemcop filed its report and controverted the claim. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ordered Itemcop to pay death benefits and burial expenses. Itemcop appealed, questioning the jurisdiction of the WCC Director under Reorganization Plan 20-A, arguing the claim was time-barred, and denying compensability.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Director of Workmen’s Compensation has jurisdiction to review and decide cases on appeal from regional offices.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the delay in filing the notice of sickness and claim for compensation.
3. W/N the employee's death is compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Director of Workmen’s Compensation has jurisdiction to review and decide compensation cases on appeal. Reorganization Plan 20-A, adopted by the Government Survey and Reorganization Commission under Republic Act 997, validly granted the authority to abolish, create, and transfer functions and positions. The Director’s authority as *ex-officio* chairman of the WCC to decide appealed cases is a valid reallocation of powers already possessed and does not constitute an undue delegation of legislative power.

2. **NO.** The claim is not barred. First, under Section 27 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, failure to give notice of injury is not a bar to the proceeding if the employer had actual knowledge of the accident or sickness, which Itemcop admitted it had. Second, Itemcop failed to controvert the claim within the period prescribed by Section 45 of the Act (within 14 days of disability or 10 days of knowledge). This failure constitutes a renunciation of the right to challenge the claim. Since Itemcop was guilty of laches, it cannot use the claimant's laches as a defense.

3. **YES.** The death is compensable. Under Section 44(1) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, a claim is presumed compensable in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. The burden is on the employer to disconnect the injury from employment. Medical evidence indicated that the continuous exertion of lifting heavy objects could produce a "stress ulcer" or aggravate an existing condition, leading to hemorrhage. Itemcop failed to discharge its burden to prove otherwise. As social legislation, the Act must be liberally construed to give relief to workmen.

**Petition denied. Decision affirmed.**
