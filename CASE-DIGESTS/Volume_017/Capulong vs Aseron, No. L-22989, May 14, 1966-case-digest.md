I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO CAPULONG v. TIMOTEO Y. ASERON, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of Customs, G.R. No. L-22989, May 14, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On October 20, 1954, petitioner Bienvenido Capulong imported 39 packages of merchandise from Hong Kong. The importation was not covered by any import license or release certificate from the Central Bank as required by Central Bank (CB) Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 [1, 2]. Consequently, the Commissioner of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the goods under said Circulars in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code (RAC). The goods were released to petitioner upon the filing of a surety bond worth P22,410.00 [2].

On May 18, 1960, the Commissioner rendered judgment confiscating the bond and ordering petitioner and the surety to pay the amount [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's decision. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the goods cannot be forfeited because Circulars 44 and 45 do not expressly provide for forfeiture, and that said Circulars were repealed by CB Circular No. 133, thereby abating the case [3-5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the merchandise is subject to forfeiture for violation of CB Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 despite said circulars not expressly prescribing forfeiture.
2. W/N the subsequent issuance of CB Circular No. 133 repealed Circulars 44 and 45 and abated the forfeiture proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The merchandise is subject to forfeiture. The Court held that CB Circulars 44 and 45 must be correlated with Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code, which authorizes the forfeiture of merchandise of prohibited importation or merchandise the importation of which is effected "contrary to law" [4]. The term "customs law" includes regulations issued pursuant to law and enforceable by the Bureau of Customs; thus, a violation of these Circulars constitutes an importation contrary to law under Section 1363(f) of the RAC [6]. The Court cited *Pascual v. Commissioner of Customs* to sustain that importations without the necessary licenses fall within the class of merchandise subject to forfeiture [7].

2. **NO.** The proceedings were not abated. First, CB Circular 133 did not repeal but rather re-enacted Circulars 44 and 45 by incorporating existing regulations not inconsistent with it [5]. Second, even assuming an implied repeal, it does not abate the forfeiture case because forfeiture proceedings are civil in nature, not criminal [8]. The Court, citing *Roxas v. Sayoc*, ruled that the expiration or repeal of a law does not divest the Commissioner of Customs of jurisdiction duly acquired while the law was in force, nor does it annul decisions rendered prior to the repeal [8].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [9].
