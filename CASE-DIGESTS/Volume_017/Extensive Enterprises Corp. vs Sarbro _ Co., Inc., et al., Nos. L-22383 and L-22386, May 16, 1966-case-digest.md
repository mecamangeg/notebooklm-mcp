I. CAPTION
EXTENSIVE ENTERPRISES CORPORATION v. SARBRO & CO., INC., ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-22383 and L-22386, May 16, 1966, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The Director of Forestry opened for bid a 29,000-hectare forest area in Compostela, Davao (Notice No. 1900). The Committee on Award awarded the area to respondent Sarbro & Co., Inc. (Sarbro), subject to certain conditions. Sarbro failed to comply initially, leading to the cancellation of the award, but the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) later reinstated it after Sarbro complied. Petitioner Extensive Enterprises Corporation (Extensive), a losing bidder, appealed to the Office of the President.

Acting Executive Secretary Enrique Quema, acting by authority of the President, rendered a decision dividing the area equally between Sarbro and Extensive, reasoning that both were qualified and the division served the policy of equitable distribution of resources. Consequently, the Executive Secretary ordered the cancellation of Sarbro’s temporary permit for the whole area.

Sarbro filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila without first filing a motion for reconsideration with the Executive Secretary. The CFI affirmed the Executive Secretary's decision. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the judgment, awarding the entire area to Sarbro. Extensive appealed to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the lower court found Extensive and its lawyers guilty of contempt for attempting to nullify a restraining order protecting Sarbro's possession during the pendency of the case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Sarbro failed to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a court action without first moving for reconsideration of the Executive Secretary's decision.
2. W/N the Executive Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion in modifying the DANR Secretary's decision by dividing the forest area.
3. W/N Extensive and its lawyers are guilty of contempt.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** While the general rule requires exhausting administrative remedies to give the agency a chance to correct errors, there are exceptions. The Court ruled that since the Executive Secretary is an *alter ego* of the President, and an appeal to the President from the Department Secretary is not strictly necessary for the doctrine to apply (*Villena v. Secretary of Interior*), a motion for reconsideration of the Executive Secretary's decision is even less necessary. The highest administrative authority had already spoken after careful study; thus, requiring a formal motion for reconsideration would have been a "useless formality" [1].

2. **NO.** The Executive Secretary acted within his powers. Under Article VII, Section 10(1) of the Constitution, the President has "control" over all executive departments, which implies the power to alter, modify, or set aside the acts of a subordinate and substitute his judgment for theirs (*Mondano v. Silvosa*). Acting for the President, the Executive Secretary had undisputed jurisdiction to modify the DANR Secretary's award. The division of the area was justified by the fundamental government policy to disperse the bounties of natural resources to as many qualified applicants as possible and prevent the concentration of wealth [2-4].

3. **YES.** Extensive and its lawyers were correctly found guilty of contempt. The record showed they attempted to have Sarbro's license cancelled and nullified the effect of the lower court's restraining order, which was issued specifically to maintain the *status quo* and protect Sarbro's possession of the area pending the resolution of the preliminary injunction incident [5].

**DISPOSITION:** The decision of the Court of Appeals is MODIFIED. Extensive Enterprises Corporation is declared entitled to one-half (1/2) of the area advertised in Notice No. 1900, and the Director of Forestry is ordered to issue the corresponding license. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.
