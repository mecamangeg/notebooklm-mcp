I. CAPTION
LIM ENG YU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20809, August 31, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lim Eng Yu filed a petition for naturalization in 1961. His income tax returns from 1958 to 1960 showed an average annual income of only P2,834.08, though he later claimed these figures represented "net savings" to explain his ability to support his family, admitting he concealed his true income to evade taxes. He also claimed to own real property worth over P5,000 but failed to present documentary evidence like tax declarations. Furthermore, he did not attach a Certificate of Arrival to his petition, submitting an Immigrant Certificate of Residence instead. One of his character witnesses, Francisco Arias, was employed as his bookkeeper. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the petition, and the Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
2. W/N the failure to submit a Certificate of Arrival is fatal to the petition.
3. W/N the character witnesses presented were credible.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** An average annual income of P2,834.08 is not considered lucrative considering the high cost of living and the petitioner's obligation to support a wife and two children [1]. Moreover, the petitioner's admission that he underdeclared his income to treat it as "net savings" indicates concealment to evade lawful taxes; such conduct demonstrates that his moral character is not irreproachable, which disqualifies him for naturalization [2, 3].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law makes the submission of the Certificate of Arrival mandatory [4]. The petitioner's failure to attach this certificate is fatal to his application, and the submission of an Immigrant Certificate of Residence does not constitute substantial compliance [5].

3. **NO.** The law requires character witnesses to be credible persons with independence of mind to act as insurers of the applicant's character [6]. A witness who is an employee of the petitioner, such as his bookkeeper, is presumed biased, unreliable, and untrustworthy, rendering them unqualified to testify [6, 7].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and the petition for naturalization is **DENIED** [8].
