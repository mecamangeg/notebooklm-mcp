I. CAPTION
BIENVENIDO CAPULONG v. THE ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22990, May 19, 1966.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bienvenido Capulong imported merchandise into the Philippines. The importation was effected without the necessary import license required by Central Bank Circular 45 and the release certificates required by Central Bank Circular 44 [1, 2]. Consequently, the goods were seized and subjected to forfeiture proceedings by the Respondent Acting Commissioner of Customs. Capulong argued against the forfeiture, noting that the circulars themselves did not prescribe such a penalty. The Court of Tax Appeals rendered a decision adverse to Capulong, prompting him to file a petition for review by certiorari with the Supreme Court [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the imported goods are subject to forfeiture for violation of Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45, despite the circulars not explicitly providing for such penalty.
2. W/N the subsequent issuance of Central Bank Circular 133 abated the pending forfeiture proceedings.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that importations made without the licenses and certificates required by Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 are "illegal importations" subject to forfeiture [1]. Although the circulars do not specifically prescribe forfeiture, they constitute "customs law" as they are regulations issued pursuant to law and enforceable by the Bureau of Customs [5, 6]. Consequently, their violation falls under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code, which authorizes the forfeiture of merchandise the importation of which is effected "contrary to law" [1, 5, 6].

2. **NO.** The Court held that Circular 133, which effectively re-enacted Circulars 44 and 45, could not abate the forfeiture case pending at the time of its issuance [7, 8]. Citing *Roxas vs. Sayoc*, the Court reasoned that forfeiture proceedings are civil in nature and not criminal; thus, the proceedings are not extinguished by the subsequent circular [2, 8].

The Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [3].
