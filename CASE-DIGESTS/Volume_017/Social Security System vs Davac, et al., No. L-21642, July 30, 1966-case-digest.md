I. CAPTION
SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM v. CANDELARIA D. DAVAC, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21642, July 30, 1966, 17 SCRA 863, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petronilo Davac, a member of the Social Security System (SSS), designated respondent Candelaria Davac as his beneficiary in his Member's Record, indicating her relationship as "wife." Petronilo died on April 5, 1959. Two claimants filed for death benefits: (1) Candelaria Davac, the designated beneficiary with whom he contracted a second marriage in 1949; and (2) respondent-appellant Lourdes Tuplano, his first and legal wife whom he married in 1946.

The SSS filed a petition with the Social Security Commission (SSC) to determine who was entitled to the benefits. The SSC ruled in favor of Candelaria Davac. Tuplano appealed, arguing that the designation of a bigamous wife is null and void because it contravenes Article 739 of the Civil Code regarding donations between persons guilty of concubinage, and deprives the legal wife of her share in the conjugal property and legitime [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the designated beneficiary, who is the second wife, is entitled to the SSS death benefits over the legal wife.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the SSC resolution declaring Candelaria Davac entitled to the benefits.

Under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 1161, the beneficiary "as recorded" by the employer is entitled to the death benefits [4]. The Court held that the disqualification under Article 739 of the Civil Code, which voids donations between persons guilty of concubinage, does not apply to Candelaria because she was not guilty of concubinage. For a woman to be guilty of concubinage, she must know the man to be married, and there was no proof Candelaria knew of Petronilo's previous marriage [5].

Furthermore, SSS benefits do not form part of the conjugal partnership or the estate of the deceased member. They are in the nature of a special privilege paid from a public special fund [6, 7]. Since the benefits are not part of the estate, the laws of succession do not apply unless there is no designated beneficiary or the designation is void. Here, the designation was valid; thus, the designated beneficiary takes precedence over the legal heirs (*Tecson v. Social Security System*) [8].

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is affirmed [9].
