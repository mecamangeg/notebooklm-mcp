I. CAPTION
BARTOLOME BARNIDO and MELENCIO BARNIDO v. MARIANO BALANA and MERITO C. PERFECTO, as Justice of the Peace of Sto. Domingo, G.R. No. L-26275, July 26, 1966, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Mariano Balana filed a civil action for malicious prosecution against petitioners (Barnido brothers) in the Justice of the Peace Court of Sto. Domingo, Albay, which ruled in Balana's favor [1]. Within the 15-day reglementary period to appeal, petitioners went to the Municipal Treasurer to deposit the cash appeal bond and appellate docket fee. The Treasurer requested only P24.00 for the docket fee, which petitioners paid in good faith [2]. After the appeal period expired, petitioners' counsel was notified of a P16.00 shortage in the fee, which was immediately paid [3]. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay dismissed the petitioners' subsequent petition for relief, ruling that the failure to pay the correct fee was not excusable negligence as they were represented by counsel and the Treasurer is not a court officer [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal was perfected despite the incomplete payment of the docket fee within the reglementary period due to the Municipal Treasurer's error.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioners should not be made answerable for the failure to pay the full docket fee, as it was due to the mistake of the Municipal Treasurer [4, 5]. Petitioners acted in good faith by relying on the word of the Treasurer, who is in a position to know the correct fees required [5]. Citing *Tagulao v. Padlanmundok* and *Segovia v. Barrios*, the Court emphasized that "every citizen has the right to assume and trust that a public officer charged by law with certain duties knows his duties and performs them in accordance with law," and penalizing a citizen for such reliance is "repugnant to justice" [4, 5]. Thus, petitioners were deemed to have substantially complied with the requirements for perfecting an appeal [4, 6].

The decision of the lower court was **REVERSED**, and the case was remanded for further proceedings [6].
