I. CAPTION
PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and PAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-20434, July 30, 1966, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Due to a strike by flight engineers in the United States which curtailed its global flights, petitioner Pan American World Airways, Inc. (Pan Am) filed an urgent petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) in a pending case (Case No. 30-IPA) requesting authority to furlough 80 employees. The CIR granted the authority [1]. Pan Am placed the employees on furlough for two days, February 22 and 23, 1961, and recalled them immediately upon the strike's termination [1].

Respondent Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) (Case No. 2744-ULP), alleging an illegal lockout [2]. The CIR found that Pan Am was not guilty of ULP as the layoff was justified and done in good faith with court approval. However, considering the economic hardship on the employees, the CIR ordered Pan Am to pay their wages for the two-day furlough [3, 4]. Pan Am moved for reconsideration, arguing the award was improper given the dismissal of the ULP charge, but the CIR en banc affirmed the order [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations may order the payment of back wages after finding the employer not guilty of unfair labor practice.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's order regarding the payment of back wages.

The Court held that under the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act 875), the CIR's authority to order reinstatement with or without back pay is expressly contingent upon a finding that the employer engaged in unfair labor practice [6, 7]. When the ULP charge is not substantiated, the law implicitly withholds this authority and directs the CIR to simply dismiss the complaint [6, 8].

The Court rejected the argument that the CIR could exercise its general powers of mediation and conciliation under Commonwealth Act 103. ULP cases are distinctive proceedings prosecuted like criminal offenses involving public right or policy, where the CIR is inhibited from exercising arbitration and conciliation powers applicable to other labor disputes [9]. Furthermore, the ULP case (Case No. 2744-ULP) was distinct from the certified labor dispute (Case No. 30-IPA), involving different issues and causes of action, and thus was not merely an incident of the latter [10].

Finally, the Court emphasized that Pan Am acted in good faith, having sought prior authorization from the CIR before effecting the furlough [11]. Since the work stoppage was not due to the employer's lockout or ULP, the economic loss should not be shifted to the employer [12].

The petition was granted. The CIR order was affirmed insofar as it declared Pan Am not guilty of ULP, but reversed insofar as it ordered the payment of back wages [13].
