I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MACARIO CASALME, G.R. No. L-18033, July 26, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Macario Casalme and Domingo Veras were foremen at the Canlubang Sugar Estate. On December 19, 1959, they had an altercation where Veras punched Casalme, who ran away shouting, "Magbabayad ka rin" (You will pay). The following evening, December 20, as Veras was walking home, Casalme suddenly emerged from his sister's house, uttered "panahon na" (it is time), and shot Veras five times without warning. Veras died from the gunshot wounds. Casalme fled to Bataan and Tagaytay but later surrendered to the authorities. The Court of First Instance of Laguna convicted Casalme of murder, ruling that the crime was attended by treachery, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Casalme appealed, questioning his identification as the killer and the finding of treachery.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Treachery does not connote the element of surprise alone, but exists when the offender employs means, methods, or forms which tend directly and specially to insure the execution of the offense, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make (Art. 14, par. 16, Revised Penal Code) [1, 2]. Although Casalme threatened the victim the day before, Veras had no idea how the threat would be carried out. Casalme accosted the victim suddenly and shot him five times without warning, leaving Veras unable to defend himself [2].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the appellant voluntarily surrendered first to the Justice of the Peace, posting a bond, and then to the Constabulary headquarters [3, 4]. As there was no record that an order of arrest was served upon him prior to these acts, the circumstance of voluntary surrender was considered in mitigation [4].

The judgment of the lower court was **MODIFIED**. The penalty was reduced to an indeterminate sentence ranging from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Dizon, Regala, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [5].
