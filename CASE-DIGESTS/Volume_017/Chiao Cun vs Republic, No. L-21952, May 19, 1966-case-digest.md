I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR ADMISSION AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LIM CHIAO CUN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21952, May 19, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 9, 1961, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting Lim Chiao Cun’s petition for naturalization. After the lapse of the two-year period required by Republic Act No. 530, the government appealed the order allowing the petitioner to take his oath of allegiance. The record revealed that in 1953, prior to filing his petition but within the required ten-year residence period, the petitioner left the Philippines for Hong Kong to get married. He subsequently returned to Hong Kong several times, siring three children whom he kept in that country while merely visiting them.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the State can raise objections to the petitioner’s qualifications during the hearing for oath-taking, even if these were not raised in the lower court.
2. W/N the petitioner is disqualified from naturalization due to his travel abroad and failure to reside continuously in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A petition for naturalization is of a special nature necessarily involving public interest. Consequently, in case of appeal, the entire record of the case is open for scrutiny, regardless of whether an objection was submitted in the lower court. The State is not precluded from objecting to the petitioner's qualifications even during the hearing of the petition to take oath (*Dalmacio Cheng v. Republic*; *Republic v. Go Bon Lee*).

2. **YES.** The law requires that an applicant for naturalization must not leave the country during the ten-year period of residence. The petitioner’s act of leaving for Hong Kong to marry and visiting his family there during this period is fatal to his application. Furthermore, his conduct of keeping his wife and children in a neighboring country while merely visiting them demonstrates a lack of sincere desire to establish himself as a Filipino citizen and to embrace Filipino customs and traditions (*Sy See v. Republic*).

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**.
