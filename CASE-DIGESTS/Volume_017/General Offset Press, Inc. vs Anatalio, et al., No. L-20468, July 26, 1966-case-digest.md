I. CAPTION
GENERAL OFFSET PRESS, INC. v. APOLONIA ANATALIO and JUAN FEDERICO, G.R. No. L-20468, July 26, 1966, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
General Offset Press, Inc. (GOP) filed a complaint for ejectment against Anatalio and Federico in the Municipal Court of Quezon City [1]. The defendants' sole defense was their claim of ownership over the disputed land [1]. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of GOP, and the Court of First Instance of Rizal subsequently affirmed this decision, noting GOP held a Torrens Title [1, 2]. While the appeal of the ejectment case was pending, the defendants filed a separate action for quieting of title against GOP involving the same property [3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the quieting of title suit, and the subsequent petition to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-25598) was dismissed for being filed out of time, rendering the decision on ownership final [3]. GOP then moved to dismiss the present appeal on the ground that the issue had become moot [4]. The Supreme Court initially granted the dismissal, prompting the defendants to file a Motion for Reconsideration [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot and academic due to the finality of the decision in the separate quieting of title case.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that with the dismissal of the defendants' petition in the separate quieting of title case (G.R. No. L-25598), the title and ownership of GOP over the disputed property became an established, settled, and incontestable fact [5]. Since the defendants' sole defense in the ejectment suit was their claim of ownership, the final resolution of the ownership issue in the other case rendered the one and sole issue in the present appeal moot and academic [5, 6]. The Court emphasized that a dismissal on a technicality, such as filing out of time, has the same effect and consequences regarding finality as a dismissal on the merits [7]. To continue the appeal would serve no useful purpose and could risk conflicting decisions [5].

The Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED [7].
