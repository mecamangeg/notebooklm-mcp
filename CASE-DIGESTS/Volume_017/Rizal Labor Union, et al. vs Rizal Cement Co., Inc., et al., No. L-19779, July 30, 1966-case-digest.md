I. CAPTION
RIZAL LABOR UNION, ET AL. v. RIZAL CEMENT COMPANY, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-19779, July 30, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On February 13, 1958, Carlos Santos and 14 other employees of Rizal Cement Company, while members of the Binangonan Labor Union (Local 104), organized a new union called the Rizal Labor Union. Consequently, the Binangonan Labor Union expelled the 15 employees for disloyalty and demanded their dismissal from employment, invoking the closed-shop provision in their Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The Company acceded and dismissed the employees on March 22, 1958.

The dismissed employees filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The Trial Judge ruled in their favor, holding that the closed-shop proviso did not justify the dismissal. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this decision, finding the dismissal justified under the CBA. The petitioners then appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the 15 employees was justified by the closed-shop provision in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CIR *en banc* resolution and ruled that the dismissal was unjustified.

The Court held that for a closed-shop agreement to validate the dismissal of employees for non-union membership, the stipulation must be "clear and unequivocal." Because such undertakings are harsh, they must be strictly construed, and doubts must be resolved against the existence of a closed-shop. The specific provision in the CBA, where the employer agreed "to have in its employ and to employ only members in good standing of the UNION" and "not to have in its employ nor to hire any new employee... unless he is a member," was interpreted as establishing only a **limited closed-shop**.

Citing *Confederated Sons of Labor v. Anakan Lumber Company*, the Court ruled that such stipulations do not mandate that employees must *remain* members of the union to *keep* their jobs. The agreement applies only to hiring and does not affect the right of the company to retain employees who were members at the time of engagement but subsequently resigned or were expelled. Consequently, the Company and the Binangonan Labor Union were declared guilty of Unfair Labor Practice. They were ordered to reinstate the complainants and pay their back wages jointly and severally.
