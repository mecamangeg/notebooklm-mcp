**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN RAQUINIO**, G.R. No. L-16488, August 12, 1966, Sanchez, J. [1], [2]

**II. FACTS**
On November 8, 1957, in Ilocos Norte, complainant Apolonio Ravina went to a riverbank to load fish into his jeep. A heated argument ensued between Ravina and Agustin Raquinio, a barrio lieutenant, who refused to give Ravina the load. As Ravina turned to leave, the accused, Juan Raquinio, suddenly stabbed him in the stomach with a small bolo. Ravina ran and collapsed; the accused attempted to pursue him but was stopped by Agustin. The wound penetrated the liver and would have been fatal without timely medical assistance [3], [4], [5].

The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte convicted the accused of frustrated homicide, appreciating treachery as an aggravating circumstance offset by voluntary surrender [2]. The accused appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law, arguing there was no intent to kill and that treachery should not have been considered as it was not alleged in the information [6], [7], [8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the findings of fact by the trial court can be reviewed in this direct appeal.
2. W/N the crime committed is frustrated homicide.
3. W/N treachery may be proven and appreciated as a generic aggravating circumstance even if not alleged in the information.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** A direct appeal to the Supreme Court on questions of law, in criminal cases where the penalty is not death or life imprisonment, precludes a review of the facts [7]. By appealing on a question of law, the appellant is deemed to have accepted the findings of fact of the lower court without reservation and has waived the right to an inquiry into them [9].

2. **YES.** The Court held that intent to kill, being a mental process, is inferred from the nature of the weapon used, the location of the wound, its seriousness, and the persistence to kill the victim [7]. Here, the accused used a lethal bolo, struck a vital spot (the abdomen/liver), inflicted a wound that would have been fatal without medical aid, and attempted to pursue the victim. These factors confirm the intent to kill, making the crime frustrated homicide [7].

3. **YES.** Although treachery was not alleged in the information and thus cannot qualify the crime to frustrated murder, it may still be proved as a generic aggravating circumstance [8]. Evidence of such circumstances shows precisely the manner in which the offense was actually committed and aids the court in assessing the penalty [10]. The admission of such evidence does not violate the accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him [10].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [11].
