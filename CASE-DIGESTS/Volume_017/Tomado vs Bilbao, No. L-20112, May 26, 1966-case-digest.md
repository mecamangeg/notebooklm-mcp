**I. CAPTION**
**ROBERTO TOMADO v. JOAQUIN BILBAO**, G.R. No. L-20112, May 26, 1966, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 16, 1959, respondent Joaquin Bilbao, as administrator of Hacienda Paz, filed an ejectment complaint against petitioner Roberto Tomado in the Justice of the Peace Court of Hinobaan, Occidental Negros. The court ruled in favor of Bilbao. Tomado appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental (Civil Case No. 5772), which dismissed the ejectment action because Bilbao, being merely an administrator, lacked the capacity to sue [1].

Subsequently, Tomado filed a new complaint in the CFI (Civil Case No. 5953) against Bilbao to recover actual, moral, and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees, for the alleged unwarranted and malicious filing of the previous ejectment case [2]. Bilbao moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the cause of action was barred [2]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, prompting Tomado to appeal to the Supreme Court [1, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the action for damages is barred by the failure to set it up as a counterclaim in the previous ejectment case.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the damages Tomado sought to recover arose out of and were necessarily connected with the action for ejectment in the previous case (Civil Case No. 5772). Consequently, the claim for damages was a compulsory counterclaim [3, 4].

Under Rule 9, Section 4 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 9, Section 2), a counterclaim not set up shall be barred if it arises out of or is necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim. Since Tomado failed to interpose this compulsory counterclaim in the ejectment case, the action for its recovery is now barred (citing *Maclan v. Garcia*, 97 Phil. 119 and *Ozoa v. Montano*, 99 Phil. 1061) [3, 5].

The appealed order is affirmed [6].
