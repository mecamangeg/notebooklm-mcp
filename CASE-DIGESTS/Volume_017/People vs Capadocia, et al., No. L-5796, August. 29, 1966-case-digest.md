I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GUILLERMO CAPADOCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-5796, August 29, 1966, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Appellant Alfredo Palmejar, along with several others, was charged with rebellion with multiple murder, arson, kidnapping, robbery, and physical injuries. He was the national treasurer of the *Federacion Obrera de Filipinas* (FOF). The prosecution alleged that the FOF was a front for the *Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan* (HMB) and that Palmejar, alias "Ibarra," aided the rebellion by mimeographing publications and supplying money. The main evidence against him consisted of testimonies from confessed Huks (Pedro Torres Ternura, Rodrigo de Jesus, and Placido Menaje) and a letter purportedly from Huk leader Guillermo Capadocia implicating Palmejar.

The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted Palmejar of simple rebellion. He appealed, arguing that the evidence against him was insufficient and unreliable. Co-accused Jose M. Nava died pending appeal, while others withdrew theirs, leaving Palmejar as the sole appellant in this decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of appellant Palmejar for the crime of rebellion was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Palmejar.

The Court found the prosecution witnesses unreliable. The testimony of Ternura, the principal witness, was uncorroborated and suspect because he was a Huk detainee whose fate depended on cooperation with authorities. Furthermore, Ternura had a personal grievance against Palmejar, having been expelled from the FOF by Palmejar in 1949 for misappropriating funds. Similarly, the testimony of De Jesus was discredited as he was also a detainee seeking leniency, and his credibility had been rejected in a related case (*People v. Capadocia*, L-4907). Menaje’s testimony was dismissed as hearsay since he only identified Palmejar based on statements from another alleged Huk.

Regarding the letter from Capadocia implicating Palmejar, the Court ruled it inadmissible under Section 27, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court (admission by conspirator). Such an extrajudicial declaration is admissible only if the conspiracy is proven by independent evidence. Here, there was no independent proof that Palmejar participated in the conspiracy; in fact, evidence showed Palmejar had actively moved for Capadocia’s expulsion from the FOF for anti-government activities.

**Disposition:** Judgment reversed; appellant Alfredo Palmejar is ACQUITTED.
