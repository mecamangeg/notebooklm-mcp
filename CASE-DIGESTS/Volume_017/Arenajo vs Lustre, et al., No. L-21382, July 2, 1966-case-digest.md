I. CAPTION
JOSE ARENAJO v. HON. JULIAN E. LUSTRE and THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-21382, July 2, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
In February 1961, petitioner Jose Arenajo was charged with theft of a wrist watch valued at P85.00 in the Justice of the Peace Court (JPC) of Camiling, Tarlac [1]. On January 17, 1962, the JPC rendered a decision acquitting Arenajo of the criminal charge, accepting his defense that he bartered shoes for the watch in good faith. However, the court ordered the return of the watch to the complainant, Eustacio Damian, as the rightful owner [1-3].

Arenajo appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tarlac, expressly limiting his appeal "only as with regards the civil nature or aspect of this case" regarding the award of the watch to the complainant [3, 4]. Respondent Judge Lustre, relying on Section 8, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, ordered the refiling of the criminal complaint and directed that the case be tried "anew" (trial *de novo*) in both its criminal and civil aspects [5]. Arenajo and the Assistant Provincial Fiscal filed motions for reconsideration arguing double jeopardy, but these were denied [6, 7]. Arenajo filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to enjoin the retrial.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance may conduct a trial *de novo* of the criminal aspect of a case after the accused has been acquitted by the inferior court, when the appeal is limited only to the civil aspect.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A judgment of acquittal is a final verdict that takes effect immediately upon promulgation [8]. To allow the respondent Judge to retry the criminal aspect of the case would defeat the essence of a judgment of acquittal and place the accused in double jeopardy for an offense of which he was already absolved [8].

While Section 9, Rule 40 and Section 7, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court provide that an appeal to the CFI results in a trial *de novo*, the Supreme Court held that these provisions apply to criminal cases "only if and when the appealed judgment in the Justice of the Peace (or Municipal) Court is one for conviction" [9]. Since Arenajo was acquitted and confined his appeal solely to the civil aspect, the CFI erred in ordering the reopening of the criminal case [10].

The petition is granted, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent.
