I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANTONIO YU TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. ANTONIO YU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19110, July 30, 1966, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Antonio Yu, a citizen of Nationalist China born in Masbate, filed a petition for naturalization on June 26, 1957, in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Masbate [1-3]. Yu had resided in Palanas, Masbate, until 1941, when he moved to Manila to pursue his studies and employment [3]. By 1957, he had established a watch repair shop in Manila with an annual income of P2,400.00 and lived there with his wife and two children [3]. The CFI of Masbate granted his petition [3]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to improper venue, that Yu lacked a lucrative trade, and that he failed to allege all former places of residence [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition was filed in the proper venue.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the failure to disclose all former places of residence is fatal to the petition.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petition was filed in the wrong court. Under Section 8 of the Revised Naturalization Law, as amended, the petition must be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province where the petitioner has resided for at least one year immediately preceding the filing [2]. Since Yu had moved his residence to Manila years prior to 1957 and was working there at the time of filing, the petition should have been filed in the CFI of Manila, not Masbate [2].

2. **NO.** The Court held that an applicant for naturalization who is married and has two children cannot be said to be engaged in a lucrative business if his annual income does not amount to more than P2,400.00 [5].

3. **YES.** The petitioner failed to disclose in his petition that, aside from Palanas, Masbate, he had resided at two different places in the City of Manila prior to the filing of his petition [6]. The Court ruled that the failure of an applicant to disclose in his petition all his former places of residence is fatal [5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the appellee's petition for citizenship is **DISMISSED** [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Chief Justice Concepcion and Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [6].
