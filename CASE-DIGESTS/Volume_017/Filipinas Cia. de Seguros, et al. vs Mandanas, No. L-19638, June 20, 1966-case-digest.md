**I. CAPTION**
**FILIPINAS COMPAÑIA DE SEGUROS, ET AL. v. HON. FRANCISCO Y. MANDANAS**, G.R. No. L-19638, June 20, 1966, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners, comprising 39 non-life insurance companies and members of the Philippine Rating Bureau, filed a special civil action for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. They sought to declare the legality of Article 22 of the Bureau's Constitution, which prohibited members from effecting or accepting reinsurance with any company not a member in good standing of the Bureau [1, 2]. Respondent Insurance Commissioner Mandanas had questioned the validity of Article 22, arguing it constituted an illegal combination in restraint of trade [2, 3]. He threatened to suspend the Bureau's license and the certificates of authority of its members if the provision was not repealed [4]. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Article 22 valid and not contrary to law or public policy [5]. The Insurance Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Article 22 of the Philippine Rating Bureau's Constitution constitutes an illegal restraint of trade.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the provision is valid. The test to determine if an agreement constitutes an unlawful machination or combination in restraint of trade is whether, under the particular circumstances, the contract is "unreasonable" (*Ferrazini v. Gsell*) [6, 7]. Restrictions upon trade may be upheld when they are not contrary to public welfare and are not greater than necessary to afford fair and reasonable protection to the party in whose favor they are imposed (*Ollendorf v. Abrahamson*) [6, 8].

In this case, the Court found nothing unlawful, immoral, or unreasonable in the objectives of the Bureau. The purpose of Article 22 is not to eliminate competition but to promote ethical practices and prevent "underrating," which is ultimately injurious to the public [9, 10]. The limitation on reinsurance does not affect the public, as the insurer's liability remains the same regardless of reinsurance [11]. Furthermore, the Bureau's rate-fixing activities cannot harm the public because no insurance company may charge a premium rate that has not been approved by the Insurance Commissioner [11, 12]. Thus, Article 22 is a reasonable restraint that merely regulates and promotes competition rather than suppresses it.

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [13].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, J.P. Bengzon, Zaldivar, and Sanchez concurred. Justices J.B.L. Reyes and Barrera took no part [13].
