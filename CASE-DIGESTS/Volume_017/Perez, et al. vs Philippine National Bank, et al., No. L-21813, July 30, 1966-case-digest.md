I. CAPTION
AMPARO G. PEREZ, ET AL. v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21813, July 30, 1966, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Perez mortgaged Lot No. 286-E of the Kabankalan Cadastre to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) in 1939 to secure a loan. Vicente died intestate in 1942, leaving an outstanding balance [1]. His widow instituted estate proceedings in 1956, which were closed without PNB filing a claim [2].

In 1963, PNB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage pursuant to a special power of attorney inserted in the deed. The property was sold to PNB, and a new title was issued in its name [3]. The widow and heirs were not notified of the foreclosure [3]. They filed a suit to annul the sale. The lower court, relying on *Pasno v. Ravina*, declared the extrajudicial foreclosure void, ruling that the power to sell terminated upon the mortgagor's death and that PNB should have foreclosed judicially [4]. PNB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a mortgage creditor can extrajudicially foreclose a mortgage after the death of the mortgagor.
2. W/N the extrajudicial foreclosure is void due to lack of notice to the heirs.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court expressly overruled the majority opinion in *Pasno v. Ravina* and held that a mortgage creditor may extrajudicially foreclose even after the mortgagor's death [5]. Under Section 7, Rule 87 (now Rule 86) of the Rules of Court, a secured creditor has three remedies: (1) waive the mortgage and claim the entire debt as an ordinary claim against the estate; (2) judicially foreclose and prove deficiency as an ordinary claim; or (3) rely on the mortgage exclusively, foreclosing at any time before prescription [5, 6]. The third option includes extrajudicial foreclosure [5]. Furthermore, the power to foreclose is not an ordinary agency revoked by death, but an authority conferred for the mortgagee's protection which survives the death of the mortgagor [7].

2. **NO.** The failure to notify the heirs does not invalidate the foreclosure sale; however, it affects the right of redemption [8]. While the foreclosure was valid, the Bank's failure to notify the widow and heirs prevented them from blocking the sale or effecting a seasonable redemption [8]. Therefore, justice and equity demand that the heirs be permitted to redeem the property within a reasonable time [8].

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. The extrajudicial foreclosure and cancellation of title are declared VALID. The heirs are declared entitled to redeem the property by paying the debt and expenses within 60 days from the determination of the balance [9, 10].
