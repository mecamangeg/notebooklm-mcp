I. CAPTION
MELECIO B. QUETULIO, ET AL. v. ILDEFONSO GANITANO, G.R. No. L-21173, June 23, 1966, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On March 28, 1962, petitioners Melecio Quetulio et al. filed a complaint against respondent Ildefonso Ganitano for the accounting of products from a parcel of land [1]. Ganitano filed his answer within the reglementary period, alleging ownership of the land via a deed of sale and a quitclaim executed by petitioners [1, 2]. However, on July 28, 1962, the trial court declared Ganitano in default upon petitioners' motion, which claimed they were not served a copy of the answer [2].

Ganitano filed a verified motion to set aside the order of default, proving through the testimony of his counsel and the local mail carrier that a copy of the answer had been mailed and delivered to the housemaid of petitioners' counsel [2, 3]. The trial court granted the motion and set aside the default order [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the trial court erred because Ganitano's motion was not accompanied by a separate affidavit of merit as required by Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the verified motion to set aside the order of default was sufficient despite the lack of a separate affidavit of merit.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the respondent's motion, which was under oath, substantially complied with Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court and took the place of an affidavit of merit [5, 6]. The verified motion expressly stated that the respondent had a good defense, specifically that he purchased the land through a deed of absolute sale registered with the Register of Deeds and that petitioners had acknowledged having no interest in the land [7].

The Court ruled that if this defense were true, the respondent would have a good case [6]. Citing *Manila Railroad Co. v. Attorney General*, the Court emphasized that the Rules of Court must be liberally interpreted (Sec. 2, Rule 1) to promote their object and facilitate the application of justice [6]. Consequently, the order of the lower court setting aside the default was affirmed [8].
