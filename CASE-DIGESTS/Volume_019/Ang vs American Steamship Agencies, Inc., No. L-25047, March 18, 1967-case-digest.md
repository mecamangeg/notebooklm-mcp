**I. CAPTION**
DOMINGO ANG v. AMERICAN STEAMSHIP AGENCIES, INC., G.R. Nos. L-25047 & L-25050, March 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
Yau Yue Commercial Bank agreed to sell goods to Davao Merchandising Corp. and Herminio Teves. The goods were shipped to Manila with American Steamship Agencies, Inc. acting as the carrier's agent. The bills of lading (B/L) were sent to a bank, deliverable only upon payment. Teves and Davao Merchandising failed to pay, so the B/Ls were returned to Yau Yue, who endorsed them to petitioner Domingo Ang [1, 2].

However, the respondent agent issued a "Permit to Deliver" to the buyers after they produced bank guarantees, allowing them to obtain the goods from Customs without surrendering the original B/Ls [3]. Ang, holding the B/Ls, demanded the goods or their value, but the respondent refused [4]. Ang filed complaints for misdelivery and conversion in the Court of First Instance of Manila roughly two and a half years after the goods arrived [4, 5]. The respondent moved to dismiss, arguing the actions had prescribed under Section 3(6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which sets a one-year limit for suits regarding "loss or damage" [6]. The lower courts dismissed the complaints on the ground of prescription [7, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the plaintiff's cause of action for misdelivery prescribes within one year under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the one-year prescriptive period under Section 3(6) of the COGSA applies only to "loss or damage" and not to misdelivery or conversion [9].

Since "loss" is not defined in COGSA, the Court applied Article 1189 of the Civil Code, which defines loss as when a thing "perishes, or goes out of commerce, or disappears in such a way that its existence is unknown or it cannot be recovered" [10]. Misdelivery constitutes delivery to the wrong person, not a loss of the goods themselves [11]. Consequently, the special short prescription period for maritime perils does not apply [12]. Instead, the applicable prescriptive periods are those found in the Civil Code: ten years for breach of written contract (Art. 1144) or four years for quasi-delict (Art. 1146) [5]. Since the complaints were filed within these periods, the actions have not prescribed.

The orders of dismissal were **REVERSED** and the cases remanded for further proceedings [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred [8].
