I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO CHANGE NAME OF ONG HUAN TIN TO TERESITA TAN. ONG HUAN TIN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20997, April 27, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ong Huan Tin filed a petition to change her name to Teresita Tan in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila [1]. After due publication and setting the case for hearing, the lower court *motu proprio* dismissed the petition before it could be heard on the merits [1]. The lower court ruled that an alien cannot avail of the provisions of the Rules of Court relating to a change of name [1]. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this appeal to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an alien may petition for a change of name under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that an alien may petition for a change of name, provided they are domiciled in the Philippines [2].

The Court reiterated its ruling in *Yu v. Republic* that Rule 103 uses the generic term "person," which is not limited to Filipino citizens but embraces all natural persons [3, 4]. Citizenship is not a prerequisite under the Rule, nor does a change of name alter one's legal capacity, civil status, or citizenship; it merely alters the label by which a person is known [4, 5].

However, the Court qualified that not every alien may petition. Since a change of name is a proceeding *in rem* establishing status in relation to the community, and the status of an alien is governed by *lex domicilii*, only aliens **domiciled** in the Philippines may apply [2, 6, 7]. Non-resident aliens cannot avail of this right as it would serve no benefit for a temporary stay [8].

The orders of dismissal were **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [2].
