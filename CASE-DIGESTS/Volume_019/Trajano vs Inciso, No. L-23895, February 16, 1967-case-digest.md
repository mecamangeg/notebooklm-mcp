**I. CAPTION**
SEMENIANO TRAJANO v. MATEO B. INCISO, G.R. No. L-23895, February 16, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
In the November 12, 1963 election for Mayor of Lawa-an, Samar, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed Mateo Inciso the winner over Semeniano Trajano [1]. Trajano filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Samar. After trial, the CFI declared Inciso the winner by a reduced margin of 11 votes [2]. Trajano appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law involving the appreciation of 56 ballots [3]. Specifically, Trajano argued that 31 ballots counted for Inciso were void because they were filled out by two persons. The CFI had ruled these ballots valid, finding they were tampered with only *after* being deposited in the ballot box, evidenced by the fact that the ballot box had been cut open and envelopes torn [3, 4]. Trajano also sought the counting of 7 ballots rejected by the lower court, which ruled them void for being written by two persons or illegible [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 31 ballots counted for Inciso and the 7 ballots claimed by Trajano were correctly appreciated by the lower court.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's findings.

Regarding the 31 ballots for Inciso: They are **valid**. The rule is that the allowance or rejection of a ballot filled by more than one person depends on its condition *before* it was cast [6]. If it was filled by one person and tampered with *after* casting, it is valid [6]. While there is a presumption *juris tantum* that a ballot with two handwritings was defective before casting, this is rebuttable [6]. The Court upheld the CFI's factual finding that this presumption was rebutted by convincing evidence of post-election tampering, specifically that the ballot box was cut open and the municipal treasurer's office was broken into [4].

Regarding the 7 ballots claimed by Trajano: They are **void**. Six of these ballots contained the handwriting of two distinct persons *before* they were cast [7]. Under Rule 23, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code, such ballots are deemed marked and are totally null and void [7]. One ballot was correctly treated as stray because the vote for Mayor was illegible [7].

Additionally, the Court ruled that writing the name of a non-candidate does not invalidate a ballot absent evidence *aliunde* of intent to identify [8], and upheld the admission of names "Peisna" and "M. NCSO" under the *idem sonans* rule [9, 10].

The decision appealed from is affirmed *in toto* [10].
