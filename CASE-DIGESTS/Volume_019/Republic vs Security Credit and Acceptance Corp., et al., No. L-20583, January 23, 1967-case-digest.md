I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SECURITY CREDIT AND ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION, et al., G.R. No. L-20583, January 23, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Security Credit and Acceptance Corporation (Security Credit), registered with the SEC in 1961, established 74 branches and engaged in a systematic campaign inducing the public to open 59,463 savings deposit accounts with an aggregate amount of P1,689,136.74. Security Credit then lent these funds to other persons. Following a search and examination of records, the Central Bank found that Security Credit was performing banking functions without the necessary certificate of authority from the Monetary Board, in violation of Sections 2 and 6 of the General Banking Act (R.A. No. 337). The Monetary Board issued Resolution No. 1095 declaring the corporation's operations illegal. The Solicitor General filed an original *quo warranto* petition in the Supreme Court to dissolve the corporation. Respondents admitted accepting the deposits but argued they were an investment firm, not a bank. They also contended that the petition should be remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI) under the doctrine in *Veraguth v. Isabela Sugar Co.*, given the concurrent jurisdiction of the courts.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Security Credit is engaged in illegal banking operations.
2. W/N the Supreme Court should entertain the *quo warranto* petition despite concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Security Credit engaged in illegal banking. Under Section 2 of the General Banking Act (R.A. No. 337), entities regularly lending funds obtained from the public through receipts of deposits are considered banking institutions. The Court held that an investment company which loans out the money of its customers, collects interest, and charges a commission to both lender and borrower, is a bank. Security Credit's acceptance of savings deposits and lending of those funds without administrative authority constituted a violation of the law. This misuse of the corporate franchise was willful, repeated 59,463 times, and caused public injury, justifying the corporation's dissolution.

2. **YES.** The Supreme Court properly exercised its original jurisdiction. While the Supreme Court shares concurrent jurisdiction with the CFI over *quo warranto* cases, it may entertain the action directly when the main facts are undisputed and the principal issue is one of law. The Court distinguished this case from *Veraguth v. Isabela Sugar Co.*, where factual disputes required the presentation of evidence better suited for a trial court. Here, the acts of the corporation were admitted, and public interest demanded an early disposition of the case.

The writ is granted, and the defendant corporation is ordered dissolved.
