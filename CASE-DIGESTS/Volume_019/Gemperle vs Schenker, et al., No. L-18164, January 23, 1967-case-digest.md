I. CAPTION
WILLIAM F. GEMPERLE v. HELEN SCHENKER and PAUL SCHENKER, G.R. No. L-18164, January 23, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Paul Schenker, a Swiss citizen and resident of Zurich, filed a complaint (Civil Case No. Q-2796) against petitioner William Gemperle through his wife and attorney-in-fact, Helen Schenker, regarding share subscriptions and pre-emptive rights [1]. Gemperle subsequently filed the present action for damages and retraction against the spouses, alleging that Helen caused the publication of false, derogatory, and irrelevant allegations from the prior case to attack his reputation [1]. Summonses for both defendants were served personally on Helen in the Philippines, but Paul was not actually served as he was in Switzerland [2]. The lower court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction over the person of Paul and for want of cause of action against Helen, reasoning Paul was beyond the reach of Philippine courts [3]. Gemperle appealed, arguing jurisdiction was acquired.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the non-resident defendant Paul Schenker through service of summons upon his wife and attorney-in-fact in the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the lower court acquired jurisdiction over Paul Schenker through the service of summons addressed to him upon his wife, Helen [4]. The record revealed that Helen was his representative and attorney-in-fact in the prior civil case (Civil Case No. Q-2796), which was filed at her behest in said representative capacity [4]. The Court established the principle that inasmuch as the wife had authority to sue, and had actually sued, on behalf of her non-resident husband, she was also empowered to represent him in suits filed against him, particularly in a case like the one at bar, which is a direct consequence of the action brought by her on his behalf [4]. Consequently, the dismissal for want of cause of action against Helen, which was premised on the lack of jurisdiction over Paul, was also untenable [5].

**The decision was reversed and the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.** [5]
