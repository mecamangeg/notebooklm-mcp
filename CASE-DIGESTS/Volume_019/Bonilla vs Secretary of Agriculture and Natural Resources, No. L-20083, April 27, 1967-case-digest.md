**I. CAPTION**
CRISOSTOMO BONILLA and FLORA ANDRADA v. HON. SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE and NATURAL RESOURCES, VICENTE BUENAFLOR, MARCELO BUENAFLOR and LEONARDO BANAAG, G.R. No. L-20083, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Bonilla and Andrada filed fishpond applications for Lots 7296 and 7297 of the Surigao Cadastre in 1949 and early 1952, respectively [1]. Respondents Vicente Buenaflor, Marcelo Buenaflor, and Leonardo Banaag subsequently filed applications for portions of the same lots in September 1952 [2]. However, the lots were only released by the Bureau of Forestry for fishpond purposes on November 25 and 26, 1952—dates subsequent to the filing of all applications [3, 4].

The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources eventually issued an order dividing the 111.8-hectare area equally among all five applicants, ruling that this was a just and equitable disposition [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, claiming they were entitled to priority rights under Section 13(a) of Fisheries Administrative Order No. 14, having filed their applications first [6]. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, setting aside the Secretary’s order and upholding petitioners' priority rights [7]. The Secretary and private respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioners are entitled to priority rights under Fisheries Administrative Order No. 14 for applications filed before the land was released for fishpond purposes.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the priority rules under Section 13(a) of Fisheries Administrative Order Nos. 14 and 14-3 apply "only to public lands suitable for fishponds and actually released by the Bureau of Fisheries for that particular purpose" [4, 8]. Until the lands are properly declared available for fishpond purposes, "there could be nothing to apply for" [4].

Since the lots in question were released months *after* all the conflicting applications were filed, the applications must be considered "on the same level, their effectivity having commenced only at the time the area was released" [4, 9]. Consequently, the Secretary of Agriculture did not commit grave abuse of discretion in ordering the equal division of the land. The Court affirmed the administrative policy that "available lands of public domain should not be distributed with an unequal hand, favoring only a few and denying the same chance to the rest" [10].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE** [11].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. Justices Concepcion, Reyes, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [11].
