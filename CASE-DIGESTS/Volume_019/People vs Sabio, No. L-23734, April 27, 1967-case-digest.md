I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. TEODORO SABIO, G.R. No. L-23734, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On April 12, 1963, at the plaza of Manapla, Negros Occidental, appellant Teodoro Sabio was approached by his friend Romeo Bacobo. Bacobo greeted Sabio with a "foot-kick greeting," touching Sabio’s foot with his own, while asking where he spent the Holy Week [1]. In response, Sabio stood up and delivered a fist blow to Bacobo, causing a lacerated wound on Bacobo's eye that required 11 to 12 days to heal [1]. The Municipal Court convicted Sabio of less serious physical injuries [2]. On appeal, the Court of First Instance affirmed the conviction but reduced the penalty to one month and five days of *arresto mayor*, appreciating the mitigating circumstance of provocation [2]. Sabio appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the foot-kick constituted unlawful aggression justifying self-defense [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a playful "foot-kick greeting" between friends constitutes unlawful aggression to justify self-defense.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that a primordial requisite for self-defense is unlawful aggression, which requires a real danger to life or personal safety (Art. 11, Revised Penal Code; *People v. Yuman*) [3]. A playful kick at the foot by way of greeting between friends, while it may be a practical joke that hurts, does not constitute a serious or real attack on a person's safety [3]. The Court distinguished this from a slap on the face, which is considered unlawful aggression because it is a serious attack on a person's dignity and a defiance of their personality [4]. The kick in this case was merely a slight provocation [3]. The judgment appealed from was affirmed *in toto* [5].
