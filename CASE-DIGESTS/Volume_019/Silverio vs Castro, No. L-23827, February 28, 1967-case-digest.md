I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO A. SILVERIO v. PEDRO CASTRO (deceased); MISAEL CLAMOR (Intervenor), G.R. No. L-23827, February 28, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections for Mayor of Cateel, Davao, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed Pedro Castro the winner with 1,769 votes against Santiago Silverio’s 1,754 votes. Silverio filed an election protest in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao, and Castro filed a counter-protest [1]-[2]. During the pendency of the case, Castro died and was succeeded by Vice-Mayor Misael Clamor. The CFI subsequently rendered a decision declaring Silverio the winner by seven (7) votes (1,740 to 1,733) [2]. Clamor intervened to appeal the decision directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law regarding the appreciation of 119 ballots [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Vice-Mayor has the standing to appeal the trial court's decision after the death of the protestee (Mayor).
2. W/N the CFI erred in invalidating certain ballots as "marked" or written by one person, and in validating others containing alleged marks.

IV. RULING
**1. YES.** The Court recognized the personality of the Vice-Mayor to intervene and appeal. Where the protestee, who had been proclaimed mayor, dies during the pendency of the protest and the vice-mayor succeeds to the office, the vice-mayor may appeal from the judgment of the trial court declaring the protestant the winner [4].

**2. YES, in part.** The Supreme Court reversed the CFI's appreciation of several ballot groups, applying the rule that the purpose of election laws is to give effect to the will of the voter and doubts must be resolved in favor of validity [5].

*   **Marked Ballots:** Words like "Egg", "Toli", "Pudpud", "Salokot", "Towang", and "C Vote" are obvious identification marks and invalidate the ballot [6]. The prefix "Dr." is allowed under Rule 5, Sec. 149 of the Revised Election Code (REC) but becomes a mark if used in a pattern [6]. However, the use of "Datu" in a single ballot is a valid prefix under the same rule and not a mark where no pattern exists to reveal an intention to identify [7]. A ballot with "x" written both before and after the candidate's name is marked [8].
*   **Handwriting Analysis:** The CFI erred in invalidating 11 ballots on the ground that they were prepared by one person based merely on "general appearance or pictorial effect" [9]. General resemblance is insufficient; there must be individual characteristics to exclude accidental coincidence [10]. The Court found internal consistencies in letter structures (e.g., 'R', 'P', 'g') and fluency in the writings which negated the theory of disguise or common authorship [11]-[9].
*   **Other Matters:** Nicknames like "Oto" or "Bobby" are valid absent proof they identify the voter [12]. Votes for non-candidates are stray votes, not marks [13]. Large block letters conforming to the ballot space are valid [14].

**Disposition:** The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**. Protestee Castro (represented by Intervenor Clamor) is declared the winner by a plurality of seven (7) votes [15].
