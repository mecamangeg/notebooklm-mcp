I. CAPTION
THE GUAGUA ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT COMPANY, INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE HONORABLE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-23611, April 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Guagua Electric operated under municipal franchises granted pursuant to Act 667, which prescribed franchise tax rates of 1% to 2% [1, 2]. Initially, Petitioner paid the higher 5% rate under Section 259 of the Tax Code but later sought a refund, believing the lower franchise rates applied. The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) refunded P16,593.87 for the period of 1951-1956 [3, 4]. Subsequently, the Supreme Court ruled in *Hoa Hin Co., Inc. v. David* that the 5% Tax Code rate applies to Act 667 franchises [5]. Consequently, the CIR assessed a deficiency tax and sought to recover the P16,593.87 previously refunded, treating it as a debt governed by the Civil Code's 6-year prescriptive period, and imposed a 25% surcharge [4, 6, 7]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling that Petitioner failed to raise the defense of prescription regarding the refunded amount [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Petitioner is liable for the 5% franchise tax rate under Sec. 259 of the Tax Code.
2. W/N the government's right to recover the erroneously refunded amount of P16,593.87 has prescribed.
3. W/N the imposition of the 25% surcharge is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The constitutionality of collecting franchise tax at the rate of 5% of gross receipts under Section 259 of the Tax Code, rather than the lower rates fixed by franchises granted under Act 667, is a settled matter [9]. Petitioner is liable for the 5% rate.

2. **YES.** The demand to recover the P16,593.87 erroneously refunded is, in effect, an assessment for deficiency franchise tax [4]. As such, the right to assess or collect it is governed by Section 331 of the Tax Code (a special law), which provides a 5-year prescriptive period, rather than Article 1145 of the Civil Code (a general law) [10]. Since the deficiency covers the period prior to January 1, 1956, the right to assess and collect it had already prescribed by the time the assessment was made in 1961 [11, 12].

3. **NO.** The Petitioner acted in good faith in paying the tax at the lower rates fixed by its franchises, a view initially shared by the Bureau of Internal Revenue when it granted the refund [7]. It is patently unfair for the Government to require the payment of a 25% surcharge under these circumstances [7].

The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The recovery of the P16,593.87 refunded amount and the 25% surcharge are eliminated, reducing the tax liability to P19,938.12 [13].
