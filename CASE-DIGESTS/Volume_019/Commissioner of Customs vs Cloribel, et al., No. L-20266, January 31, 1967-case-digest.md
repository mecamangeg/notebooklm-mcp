**I. CAPTION**
THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VI, and HERMINIO G. TEVES, G.R. No. L-20266, January 31, 1967, 19 SCRA 235, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Herminio G. Teves entered into a contract with NARIC to export rice and import collateral goods (barter). Following a presidential suspension of rice exports due to shortages, Teves obtained authority to import collateral goods ahead of exportation, limited to his contractual commitments as of September 14, 1960. He imported 22 shipments (cars, rubber, etc.) which the Commissioner of Customs (Petitioner) withheld pending NARIC clearance pursuant to a directive.

To secure the release of the goods, Teves posted surety bonds totaling P294,620.25, conditioned on the forfeiture of the amount should the importations be found illegal. Teves then filed a petition for *Prohibition and Mandamus* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila (Civil Case No. 51296) against the Commissioner and others. He prayed for a preliminary mandatory injunction to cancel the bonds he had just posted.

Respondent Judge Cloribel granted the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, ordering the Commissioner to cancel the bonds. The Commissioner moved to reconsider and quash the writ, arguing lack of jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but the motions were denied. The Commissioner filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the legality of the importation and the cancellation of the bonds.
2. W/N the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the preliminary mandatory injunction to cancel the bonds.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction. Under **Section 1207 of the Tariff and Customs Code**, the Commissioner of Customs has the duty and jurisdiction to determine the legality of an importation and secure compliance with legal requirements. Until the Commissioner renders a decision, court intervention is premature. Furthermore, **Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125** vests the **Court of Tax Appeals (CTA)** with *exclusive appellate jurisdiction* to review decisions of the Commissioner of Customs involving seizure, detention, release of property, or other matters arising under Customs Law. The CFI cannot review these matters, even if the petition is styled as mandamus or prohibition, as these are essentially petitions to review Customs actuations.

2. **YES.** The issuance of the preliminary mandatory injunction constituted grave abuse of discretion. A mandatory injunction is a provisional remedy intended to preserve the *status quo*. Here, the writ did not maintain the *status quo* (which was the release of goods *under bond*) but rather altered it by cancelling the security. By ordering the cancellation of the bonds before a trial on the merits, the Judge effectively granted the main relief and decided the case in favor of Teves, leaving the government unprotected should the importations be proven illegal. Additionally, Teves' right was not "clear and free from doubt" as there were unresolved questions regarding the validity of the barter under the NARIC charter and compliance with import limitations. "Sound judicial discretion is no license to undo the law by defeating its objectives."

**Disposition:** The petition is granted. The Orders and Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued by the respondent Judge are declared NULL and VOID. The preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court is made permanent, and the respondent Judge is directed to dismiss Civil Case No. 51296.
