I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO ORTIZ v. HON. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, PRIMITIVO R. PASTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22065, February 10, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Ortiz sought to review and annul a resolution of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dated October 17, 1963 [1]. The COMELEC resolution denied Ortiz's petition to declare the certificates of candidacy of the other respondents invalid [1]. Ortiz argued that the respondents failed to comply with Section 32 of the Revised Election Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 3522, because their certificates lacked a waiver of the privilege regarding public disclosure of their income tax returns and tax census statements for the years 1961 and 1962 [1]. Instead of invalidating the certificates, the COMELEC advised the respondents to file amended certificates including the required waiver, even though the filing period had already lapsed [1]. Following the 1963 elections, the Supreme Court reviewed the status of the case [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic if the respondents failed to be elected.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that if the respondents (excluding the COMELEC) failed to be elected in the elections held in 1963, the case would be rendered academic [2]. Consequently, the Court required the petitioner, Francisco Ortiz, to show cause within five days from notice why the petition for review should not be dismissed due to the potential mootness of the issue [2].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez and Castro, JJ., concurred with the resolution [2].
