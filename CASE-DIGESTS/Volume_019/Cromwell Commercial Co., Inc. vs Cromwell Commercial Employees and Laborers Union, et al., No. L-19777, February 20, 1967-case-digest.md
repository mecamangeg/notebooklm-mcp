I. CAPTION
CROMWELL COMMERCIAL COMPANY, INC. v. CROMWELL COMMERCIAL EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS UNION and the COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19777, February 20, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 10, 1956, petitioner Cromwell Commercial Co., Inc. and respondent Union entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). Subsequently, the Union claimed the Company violated the CBA by failing to grant stipulated salary increases, preventing the formation of a grievance committee, unilaterally changing salesmen's compensation, and dismissing employees Francisco Gaddi and Cresenciano Andrada due to union activities [1].

Conciliation failed, and the Union struck on March 11, 1957. The Company issued an ultimatum for workers to return or be dismissed [1]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found the Company guilty of unfair labor practice (ULP) and ordered the reinstatement of Gaddi and five salesmen (who were locked out) with half back wages, and the reinstatement of voluntary strikers without back wages [2]. The Union's separate appeal (G.R. No. L-19778) affirming the CIR decision became final on September 30, 1964 [3]. The Company now appeals the CIR decision regarding the ULP finding, the legality of the strike, and the award of back wages [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Company is guilty of unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the strike declared by the Union was legal.
3. W/N the award of back wages to the locked-out employees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the finding of unfair labor practice is *res judicata*, having been affirmed in the related case G.R. No. L-19778 [4]. An employer commits ULP not only by violating the CBA but also by discriminating in hire and tenure, dismissing employees for union activities, and refusing to bargain in good faith [5].

2. **YES.** A strike is legal if provoked by the employer’s failure to abide by the CBA terms, discrimination regarding hire and tenure, dismissal of employees for union activities, and refusal to bargain collectively in good faith [6, 7]. The strike was triggered by these unjust acts [7].

3. **YES.** The award of back wages to Gaddi, Andrada, and the salesmen is justified because the salesmen were practically "locked out" when ordered to garage their trucks and did not strike voluntarily [8]. Discriminatorily dismissed employees are entitled to backpay from the date of the act of discrimination [8].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is **AFFIRMED** [9].
