I. CAPTION
SERAPIO DAUAN v. THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, SIMON ILARDE, ROMUALDO ILARDE, LORD CALANGAN, SANTOS BAYSA and BASILIA TOMAS, G.R. No. L-19547, January 31, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Serapio Dauan filed a homestead application for land in Nueva Vizcaya in 1935. Following the destruction of records during the war, Dauan sold his rights to specific portions of the land to private respondents (Ilarde, et al.) between 1943 and 1951. These transfers were made without the previous approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Subsequently, Dauan requested the Bureau of Lands to cancel the respondents' free patent applications, arguing the sales were void for lack of executive approval. The Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture ruled against Dauan, holding that since there were no records showing his original application was approved, the requirement for Secretarial approval of the transfers did not apply. Dauan filed a petition for certiorari with the CFI of Nueva Vizcaya without appealing to the President. The CFI granted the petition, finding that secondary evidence proved Dauan's application had been approved, rendering the subsequent unapproved sales void. Respondents appealed, alleging failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the sales of the homestead rights to the private respondents are void.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies (appealing to the President) is not absolute and does not apply when the issue is purely legal. The Supreme Court held that determining whether Dauan’s pre-war homestead application was approved, given that official records were destroyed, is a conclusion of law drawn from proven facts which the courts may review [1-3].

2. **YES.** The Court found sufficient circumstantial evidence that Dauan’s application was approved, including: (a) a 1941 decision by the Director of Lands dismissing an adverse claim, which implied Dauan was allowed entry; (b) recitals in the transfer documents stating the application was approved on January 28, 1941; and (c) the presumption of regularity in official duties given Dauan’s qualifications and possession [4-7]. Under Section 20 of the Public Land Act, any transfer of rights made after the approval of the homestead application but before the issuance of the patent requires the previous approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [8]. Consequently, the sales made without such approval are null and void [9-11]. The purchasers were ordered to return possession of the land to Dauan upon his return of the purchase price [11].

Decision affirmed.
