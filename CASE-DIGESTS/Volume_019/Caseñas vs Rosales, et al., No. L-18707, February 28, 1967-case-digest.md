I. CAPTION
AGUSTIN O. CASEÑAS v. CONCEPCION SANCHEZ VDA. DE ROSALES (Substituted by her heirs), ROMEO S. ROSALES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18707, February 28, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In 1952, Rodolfo Arañas and petitioner Agustin O. Caseñas filed Civil Case No. 261 against Spouses Jose A. Rosales and Concepcion Sanchez for specific performance regarding a parcel of land [1]. During the pendency of the case, Arañas and defendant Jose Rosales died [2]. The trial court ordered the surviving plaintiff, Caseñas, to amend the complaint to effect the substitution of parties [2]. Caseñas failed to comply, leading the court to dismiss Civil Case No. 261 in 1957 for abandonment, which became final [3].

In 1960, Caseñas filed Civil Case No. 780 against the widow and heirs of Jose Rosales for quieting of title and reconveyance of the same property, asserting the same allegations as the first case [3]. The defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds of *res judicata*, prescription, and lack of cause of action [4]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the final dismissal of Civil Case No. 261 barred the new action under the principle of *res judicata* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the prior case (Civil Case No. 261) constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.
2. W/N the complaint states a cause of action.
3. W/N the action is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The dismissal of the prior case was void and cannot plead as a bar to the subsequent case. Under Rule 3, Section 17 of the Rules of Court, when a party dies, the court must order the appearance of the legal representatives, not the amendment of the complaint [6, 7]. Relying on *Barrameda v. Barbara*, the Supreme Court held that an order to amend the complaint before proper substitution is void, and a subsequent dismissal for non-compliance with such a void order is likewise void [8, 9]. A void dismissal does not constitute *res judicata* [10].

2. **YES.** The complaint states a sufficient cause of action. A cause of action is defined as an act or omission of one party in violation of the legal right or rights of the other, and the complaint sufficiently alleged these elements [10].

3. **DEFERRED.** The Court ruled that the resolution of the issue of prescription should be deferred until after the case is tried on the merits [11]. This is because the petitioner raised the defense of the existence of a trust relationship over the property, which requires factual determination [11].

The order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for trial on the merits [11].
