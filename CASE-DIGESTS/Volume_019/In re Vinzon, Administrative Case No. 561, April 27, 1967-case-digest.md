**I. CAPTION**
**IN RE: ATTY. ISIDRO P. VINZON**, Administrative Case No. 561, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Atty. Isidro P. Vinzon and his wife were charged with estafa for misappropriating P7,000.00 from a U.S. Depositary check belonging to Felicidad M. Bagtas, the unremarried widow of a deceased veteran [1]. The Court of First Instance of Manila found them guilty as charged after the defense waived the right to present evidence [1]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, finding that Vinzon, acting as the widow’s attorney, altered her address to his own and, with his wife, manipulated the widow to secure the funds [2, 3]. The Court of Appeals referred the matter to the Solicitor General for disbarment proceedings [2]. In his answer, Vinzon admitted the final decision but argued that conviction *per se* is not a ground for disbarment and denied the factual commission of the crime [4, 5]. Vinzon failed to appear at the scheduled disbarment hearing despite notice [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a lawyer’s conviction for the crime of estafa is a sufficient ground for disbarment.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court ruled that the term "moral turpitude" encompasses acts contrary to justice, honesty, or good morals [7]. Estafa is essentially a crime involving moral turpitude because the act is unquestionably against justice, honesty, and good morals [7]. Citing *In re Gutierrez* and *In re Basa*, the Court held that a lawyer convicted of estafa may be disbarred [7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that Vinzon's failure to appear at the hearing amounted to a waiver of his right to be heard [6]. Since his guilt was established by a final conviction, his disbarment was inevitable [7].

**ACCORDINGLY**, respondent Isidro P. Vinzon is hereby disbarred [8].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, and Sanchez, JJ., concurred. Castro, J., took no part [8].
