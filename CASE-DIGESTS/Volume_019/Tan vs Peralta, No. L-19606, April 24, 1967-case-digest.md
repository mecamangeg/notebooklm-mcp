I. CAPTION
BUENAVENTURA TAN v. THE HONORABLE MACARIO PERALTA, Secretary of National Defense, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19606, April 24, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On March 28, 1962, a composite team of law enforcement agents armed with a search warrant seized merchandise and documents from petitioner Buenaventura Tan's business establishment, B.T. Commercial, on suspicion that the goods were smuggled [1, 2]. Tan filed a petition for mandamus and declaratory relief with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court, seeking the return of the seized items and the cessation of further searches [3]. Subsequent investigations by the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue revealed that the goods were locally purchased and covered by invoices, leading to the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to file administrative or criminal charges [4-6]. Upon Tan's petition, the Court ordered the release of the goods subject to a P50,000 bond [6]. The Solicitor General later manifested that the goods had been returned and the issues had become moot, although he requested an increase in the bond amount [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the case had become moot and academic. The goods seized under the search warrant were returned to the petitioner after he posted the required P50,000 bond, and the Solicitor General himself opined that the return of said goods rendered the mandamus case moot [7, 8]. Furthermore, the Court noted that since the inception of the case, no criminal, civil, or administrative complaint had been lodged against the petitioner in connection with the seized goods [7]. Absent such actions, the Court found no ground to increase the bond as requested by the respondents [7].

CASE DISMISSED as moot, without prejudice to any further right of action the Government may have against the petitioner on the bond filed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Dizon, Regala, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred; Reyes, J.B.L., J., took no part) [9].
