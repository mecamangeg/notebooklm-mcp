I. CAPTION
TEODORO M. CASTRO v. AMADO DEL ROSARIO, et al., G.R. No. L-17915, January 31, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The position of Assistant Regional Revenue Director II for Manila (District No. 3) became vacant on August 24, 1959. Respondent Tomas C. Toledo, then the Chief Revenue Inspector/Examiner of Manila, was appointed to the vacancy by the Secretary of Finance upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue [1, 2]. Petitioner Teodoro M. Castro, who held the position of Assistant Revenue Regional Director I for San Pablo City (District No. 5), protested the appointment. Castro claimed that under Section 23 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 (Republic Act No. 2260), he was "next in line" and possessed better qualifications and seniority [2-4].

The Commissioner of Civil Service dismissed the protest, ruling that Toledo was the next ranking employee in the Manila district where the vacancy occurred [5]. Castro filed a petition for *quo warranto*, certiorari, and mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI rejected Castro’s claim to the office but strangely annulled Toledo’s appointment on the ground that Toledo's *previous* appointment as Chief Revenue Examiner was illegal [1, 5]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner Castro established a clear right to the office to justify the issuance of a writ of *quo warranto*.
2. W/N the lower court correctly annulled respondent Toledo's appointment based on the alleged illegality of his previous position.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A *quo warranto* proceeding commenced by a private person requires the petitioner to prove that they are entitled to the controverted position; otherwise, the respondent has a right to the undisturbed possession of the office [7, 8]. The Court found that the position of Chief Revenue Examiner of Manila (held by Toledo) was of the same rank as Assistant Regional Director of other regions, making Toledo the officer "next in rank" for the Manila vacancy under Sec. 23 of the Civil Service Law [9, 10]. Castro failed to prove he was next in rank or that those senior to him had waived their rights [11, 12]. Failing to establish his own clear right to the office, Castro's petition must be dismissed regardless of Toledo's title [8, 13].

2. **NO.** The legality of Toledo’s *previous* appointment as Chief Revenue Examiner cannot be raised in this proceeding because Castro does not claim entitlement to *that* specific prior position [13, 14]. Furthermore, an action for *quo warranto* must be instituted within one year from the cause of action (Unabia v. City Mayor) [15]. Toledo was appointed to the previous position on July 1, 1958, while this petition was filed only on August 6, 1960; hence, any challenge to that earlier appointment is barred by prescription [14, 16].

The judgment is modified by eliminating the portion annulling Toledo’s appointment and affirmed in all other respects [16].
