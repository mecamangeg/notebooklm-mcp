I. CAPTION
CIRILO MANAOIS v. HON. JOSE S. DE LA CRUZ and HON. AUGUSTO O. SAROCA, G.R. No. L-25567, February 20, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cirilo Manaois, the accused in a criminal case, was arraigned on July 13, 1965 [1, 2]. By agreement of the parties, the trial was initially set for September 7, 8, and 9, 1965 [2]. However, on the initial trial date, petitioner’s counsel moved for postponement alleging sickness, which the trial court granted, resetting the hearing to October 28 and 29, 1965 [3]. On October 27, 1965, just one day before the rescheduled hearing and more than three months after arraignment, petitioner filed a request for the appointment of assessors [3]. Respondent Judge De la Cruz denied the request, ruling that it was not made at the "earliest convenient time" and appeared to be intended for delay [1, 4]. After his motion for reconsideration was denied, Manaois filed this petition for certiorari [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the request for appointment of assessors filed one day before the scheduled trial.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the respondent Judge did not commit abuse of discretion, let alone grave abuse [4]. The Court held that the right to the service of assessors in a criminal trial is subject to the requirement that the request for their appointment must be made at the "earliest convenient time" so as not to hinder or delay the trial or unnecessarily inconvenience the progress of the court's work [4, 5]. Given that the petitioner was arraigned in July and waited until October 27—one day before the postponed hearing—to file the request, the trial court had sufficient reason to believe the request was not seasonably made and was merely for purposes of delay [1, 4].

Petition dismissed [6].
