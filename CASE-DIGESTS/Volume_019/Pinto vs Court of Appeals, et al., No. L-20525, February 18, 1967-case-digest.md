I. CAPTION
PETRONILA PINTO, as Judicial Guardian of the Minor, VICENTE TANTONGCO v. COURT OF APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. L-20525, February 18, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petronila Pinto, as guardian of the minor Vicente Tantongco, filed a civil case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the widow and legitimate children of the deceased Ramon Tantongco. Pinto sought to annul an extrajudicial partition, alleging the minor was a preterited acknowledged natural child, and to recover his hereditary share estimated at over P400,000 from an estate valued at over P1,000,000. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the CFI denied. Instead of appealing to the Supreme Court, the defendants filed a petition for *certiorari* with the Court of Appeals (CA) to challenge the denial. The CA rendered a decision setting aside the CFI's orders for lack of jurisdiction. Pinto filed the present petition for *certiorari* to review the CA's decision.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain the petition for *certiorari* questioning the denial of the Motion to Dismiss.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. Under the Judiciary Act then in force, the CA could issue writs of *certiorari* only "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction." Since the value of the estate exceeded P1,000,000 and the specific claim exceeded P600,000, any appeal from the main case would fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, not the Court of Appeals. Consequently, the CA had no authority to issue the writ. Furthermore, the Supreme Court reiterated the rule that an order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and generally may not be reviewed by *certiorari*.

The petition is GRANTED and the decision of the Court of Appeals is SET ASIDE.
