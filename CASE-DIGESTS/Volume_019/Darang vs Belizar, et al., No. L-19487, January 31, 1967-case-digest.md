I. CAPTION
ROSARIO DARANG v. PEDRO TY BELIZAR, ANDRES SALAMIDA and ATTY. ANDRES SAJUL, G.R. No. L-19487, January 31, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Rosario Darang, a bus operator with a certificate of public convenience (CPC) for the MacArthur-Balangiga line, filed an injunction suit (Civil Case No. 909) in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Samar. She sought to restrain defendants-appellants Belizar and Salamida from illegally operating on her line and to prevent the Motor Vehicles Registrar from registering three trucks allegedly transferred by Belizar to Salamida via a fictitious deed of sale.

At the time of filing, there were pending cases involving the parties: a complaint in the Public Service Commission (PSC) by Darang against Belizar for encroachment, and an appeal in the Supreme Court (G.R. No. L-12442) regarding Salamida's application for a CPC.

The CFI ruled in favor of Darang, declaring the sale of the trucks void for being fictitious and for lacking prior PSC approval. The court enjoined the defendants and awarded Darang P3,000 as "moral and exemplary" damages. The defendants appealed, questioning the CFI's jurisdiction and the award of damages.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI had jurisdiction to entertain the injunction suit despite pending cases in the PSC and the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the sale of public utility trucks is void solely due to lack of prior PSC approval.
3. W/N moral damages can be awarded if not specifically prayed for in the complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CFI had jurisdiction because the parties and issues in the three cases were distinct. The PSC case involved Belizar's authority to operate; the Supreme Court case involved the propriety of granting Salamida a CPC; while the CFI case involved the validity of the contract of sale and the prevention of specific illegal acts. The validity of a deed of sale is a question for the courts, not the Commission [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The CFI erred in applying the old law (Act No. 3108). Under Section 20(g) of the Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146), the approval of the PSC is not a condition precedent to the validity of a sale of public service property. The transaction is valid and binding between the parties even before approval, which is required only to protect public interest [4], [5]. However, the sale in this specific case remained void because the lower court found it to be factually fictitious, a finding not questioned on appeal [5].

3. **NO.** Under Article 2217 of the Civil Code, there must be pleading and proof of moral suffering to award moral damages. Since Darang did not specifically pray for moral damages, they were disallowed. However, the Court sustained the P3,000 award as **exemplary damages**, ruling that such an award was covered by the complaint's general prayer for "other remedies which may be just and equitable" [6].

The decision appealed from was **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the damages awarded were solely exemplary [7].
