I. CAPTION
MA-AO SUGAR CENTRAL CO., INC. v. SINFOROSO CAÑETE, G.R. No. L-26361, March 18, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Sinforoso Cañete filed a claim for workmen's compensation for pulmonary tuberculosis against petitioner Ma-ao Sugar Central. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the Regional Office's dismissal of the claim and ordered petitioner to pay Cañete P4,000.00 in lump sum, plus medical expenses. Petitioner appealed the WCC decision to the Supreme Court [1-3].

Pending the appeal, Cañete filed a motion for execution of the judgment awarding the P4,000.00. He alleged that due to his critical physical condition (tuberculosis) and destitution, he might die before the final outcome of the appeal [3, 4]. Petitioner opposed, arguing the decision faced inevitable reversal and questioned the "good reasons" for execution. The Court initially denied the motion for lack of data but reconsidered after Cañete submitted verified data on his work history, which petitioner failed to properly controvert [5-7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can order the execution of the workmen's compensation award pending appeal based on the respondent's critical condition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court has the authority to order execution pending appeal under Section 10, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court, which allows the Court to "direct otherwise upon such terms as it may deem just." Furthermore, Section 2, Rule 39 allows execution pending appeal upon "good reasons" [8, 9].

The Court found "superior reasons" and "urgent circumstances" to justify immediate execution. Cañete's affliction with pulmonary tuberculosis, his destitution, and the constant danger of death constitute compelling reasons of urgency or justice [10, 11]. Regarding the computation of the award, since the petitioner failed to submit competent data to contradict the respondent's verified data, the Court relied on the respondent's pleadings, entitling him to the maximum compensation [12, 13].

The motion for execution of judgment is **GRANTED**, and petitioner is ordered to pay respondent P4,000.00 without delay [13, 14].
