I. CAPTION
VISAYAN STEVEDORE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY (VISTRANCO) and RAFAEL XAUDARO v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, UNITED WORKERS' & FARMERS' ASSOCIATION (UWFA), VENANCIO DANO-OG, BUENAVENTURA AGARCIO and 137 others, G.R. No. L-21696, February 25, 1967, 19 SCRA 426, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners are engaged in the loading and unloading of vessels. The 139 individual respondents, members of the United Workers' & Farmers' Association (UWFA), had worked as laborers for the petitioners during every milling season since World War II. While UWFA determined who would work based on a rotation system, the laborers worked under the direction and control of the petitioners' officers, and received compensation directly from the petitioners' paymaster. At the start of the milling season in November 1955, petitioners refused to engage the services of the respondents. Petitioner Rafael Xaudaro, the Branch Manager, told the workers that they must sever their connection with UWFA if they wanted to continue working. UWFA filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP). The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ruled in favor of the respondents, ordering reinstatement with back wages. Petitioners appealed, arguing no employer-employee relationship existed as the workers were supplied by the union and their relationship terminated at the end of each milling season.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there is an employer-employee relationship between the petitioners and the respondents.
2. W/N the petitioners are guilty of Unfair Labor Practice.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The complainants are employees of the company. The Court held that where laborers work under the direction and control of company officers and receive pay directly from the company, an employer-employee relationship exists. The union merely acted as an agent for recruitment [1]. Furthermore, the employment relationship is not severed at the end of each milling season; the workers are merely considered on leave of absence without pay, and the relationship is deemed suspended, not terminated [2].

2. **YES.** The refusal to admit the workers was based on their union membership. The evidence showed that the manager explicitly conditioned their employment on severing ties with their union, UWFA. This constitutes Unfair Labor Practice [3]. The CIR correctly exercised its discretion under the law to order reinstatement with back wages for laborers dismissed due to union activities [3].

The order and resolution appealed from are affirmed.
