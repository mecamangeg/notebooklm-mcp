I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HEIRS OF CRESENCIO V. MARTIR, G.R. No. L-20192, February 28, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 11 and June 4, 1943, Cresencio V. Martir obtained two loans from the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. secured by real estate and chattel mortgages, payable one year thereafter. The bank's assets were subsequently vested in the United States and transferred to the Republic of the Philippines. On December 8, 1961, the Republic filed a complaint for foreclosure of mortgage against Martir (later substituted by his heirs). The heirs filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the action was barred by the Statute of Limitations since the obligation became due on May 11, 1944. The Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros sustained the motion and dismissed the case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to enforce the written contract has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal, ruling that the action had not yet prescribed. Under Article 1144 of the New Civil Code, actions on written contracts must be brought within 10 years from the accrual of the cause of action [1]. However, the Court held that the Moratorium Law suspended the running of the prescriptive period for monetary obligations from **November 18, 1944** (Executive Order No. 25) until **May 18, 1953** (when the law was declared unconstitutional in *Rutter v. Esteban*) [2, 3].

This suspension period lasted **8 years and 6 months**. While approximately 17 years elapsed between the accrual of the cause of action (May 11, 1944) and the filing of the complaint (December 8, 1961), the time during which the moratorium was in force must be deducted. The resulting period is only 8 years and 6 months, which is well within the 10-year prescriptive period [3].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
