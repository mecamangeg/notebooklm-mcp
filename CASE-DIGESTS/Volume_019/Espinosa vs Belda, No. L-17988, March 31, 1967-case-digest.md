I. CAPTION
POMPENIANO ESPINOSA, ET AL. v. AURELIA BELDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17988, March 31, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In a 1940 cadastral decision, Lot No. 214-A was adjudicated to Abon (Bagobo) [1]. In 1954, Original Certificate of Title (O.C.T.) No. 0–41 was issued to Abon [2]. After Abon died, his heirs sold the property to Francisco Belda, resulting in the cancellation of the O.C.T. and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (T.C.T.) No. T-5250 in Belda's name [3].

Petitioners Espinosa et al. previously filed a petition with the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 15441-R) to review the decree and cancel the O.C.T. alleging fraud, but the Court of Appeals rejected their contentions, affirmed the title, and declared Belda a purchaser in good faith [3, 4]. After this decision became final, petitioners filed the current complaint in the Court of First Instance of Davao (Civil Case No. 2951) against Belda's heirs, again seeking the cancellation of T.C.T. No. T-5250 on the ground of fraud [4]. In their complaint, petitioners admitted they entered the land knowing it was public domain and were merely homestead applicants [5, 6]. The trial court dismissed the case for failure to state a cause of action and *res judicata* [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the complaint states a cause of action.
2. W/N the action is barred by *res judicata*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioners have no cause of action because they explicitly admitted in their complaint that they are not the owners of the land but are merely homestead applicants [5, 6]. Since they admitted they do not own the property, the Court reasoned that no right of theirs could have been transgressed by the issuance of the title to another person [6].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the action is barred by *res judicata* because the prior decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 15441-R constitutes a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction [8]. The Court found that the parties, causes of action, and subject matters in the previous case and the current case are identical [8].

**Disposition:** The order of the trial court dismissing Civil Case No. 2951 is **AFFIRMED** [9].
