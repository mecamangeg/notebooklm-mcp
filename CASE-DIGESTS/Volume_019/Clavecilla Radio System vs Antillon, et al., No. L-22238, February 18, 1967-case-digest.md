I. CAPTION
CLAVECILLA RADIO SYSTEM v. HON. AGUSTIN ANTILLON and NEW CAGAYAN GROCERY, G.R. No. L-22238, February 18, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 22, 1963, respondent New Cagayan Grocery filed a complaint for damages against petitioner Clavecilla Radio System (CRS) in the City Court of Cagayan de Oro [1]. The suit arose from a telegram sent via CRS where the word "NOT" was omitted between "WASHED" and "AVAILABLE," altering the message's meaning [1, 2]. CRS filed a motion to dismiss citing improper venue, arguing that as a corporation with a principal office in Manila, the suit should be filed there [2, 3]. The City Judge (Antillon) denied the motion [2]. CRS filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Misamis Oriental to enjoin the City Judge [4]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that venue was proper in Cagayan de Oro because CRS had a branch office there and could be served with summons [4]. CRS appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N venue was properly laid in Cagayan de Oro on the ground that the corporation maintains a branch office there.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order. The Court ruled that under Corporation Law, the residence of a corporation is the place where its principal office is established [5]. In this case, CRS's principal office is in Manila. Regarding Rule 4, Section 1 of the Rules of Court (venue in inferior courts), the Court explained that the phrase allowing venue where the defendant "may be served with summons" does not apply when the defendant resides in the Philippines [5]. Since CRS has a residence in the Philippines (Manila), it may be sued only in that municipality. The Court reasoned that allowing a corporation to be sued in any place where it possesses a branch office would create confusion and work untold inconvenience to the corporation [5]. The order of dismissal was reversed [6].
