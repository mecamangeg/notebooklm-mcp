I. CAPTION
VILLEGAS v. TEEHANKEE, ET AL., No. L-27028, January 18, 1967, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Villegas, the Mayor of Manila, filed a petition challenging the validity of a directive issued by the Executive Department. The directive required all national and local offices to conform to the Department of Justice's opinion that American citizens and entities wholly owned by them were exempt from Republic Act No. 1180 (Retail Trade Nationalization Act) pending the Supreme Court's resolution in *Philippine Packing Corporation v. Reyes* [1]. Villegas argued that the Laurel-Langley Agreement did not exempt Americans from the Retail Trade Act and that the Executive's directive was contrary to law [2], [3]. He sought to stop the implementation of this policy, asserting his own interpretation as a local executive official [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to determine the rights of American entities under the Trade Agreement in this proceeding.
2. W/N the opinion of the Executive Department on national policies is binding on local executive officials like the Petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a determination of the issue raised by the petitioner would amount to a declaratory judgment, which is "admittedly beyond the original exclusive jurisdiction of this Court to render" [5]. Furthermore, such a determination would prematurely foreclose similar adjudications in approximately 20 pending cases in lower courts, thereby denying due process to corporations that are not parties to this proceeding [5].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that R.A. Nos. 1180 and 1355 and the 1955 Trade Agreement involve national policies, the enforcement of which is a constitutional duty of the President [4]. Consequently, the President's decisions and views on these statutes—unless voided by a competent court—"should prevail over those of local executive officials, such as petitioner herein, as Mayor of the City of Manila, and are binding upon the latter" [4]. Petitioner failed to show *prima facie* that the Executive's position was contrary to law [3].

The petition was **DISMISSED** and the writs prayed for were **DENIED** [4].
