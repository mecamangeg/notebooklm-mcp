**I. CAPTION**
REMEDIOS CUENCO VDA. DE BORROMEO, et al. v. HON. MATEO CANONOY, et al., G.R. No. L-25010, March 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
In the probate proceedings for the Estate of Vito Borromeo (G.R. No. L-18498), respondents Tomas, Amelia, and Fortunato Borromeo moved to exclude thirteen (13) lots from the inventory, claiming the deceased had sold them to "Cebu Arcade, T.L. Borromeo y Cia." The probate court denied the motion for exclusion, but the ruling was expressly provisional [1], [2].

Subsequently, respondents filed a separate civil action (Civil Case No. R-7646) against the Special Administrator of the Estate to recover ownership and possession of said lots [1]. The Administrator moved to dismiss/suspend this civil case, arguing that the issue of ownership was already involved in the pending appeal of the probate case [1]. Respondent Judge Canonoy denied the motion to dismiss and set the case for trial [1]. Petitioners filed this original action for prohibition to stop the Judge from proceeding with the civil case [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the separate civil action for ownership (Civil Case No. R-7646) may proceed independently of the probate proceedings.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the separate civil action is proper and must proceed. A Court of First Instance exercising probate jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to determine with finality questions of ownership involved [4], [5]. Such matters must be litigated in a separate action [5]. The probate court may only pass upon questions of inclusion or exclusion from the inventory *provisionally*, without prejudice to the final determination in an appropriate separate action [5].

Since the probate court's order denying the exclusion of the lots was merely provisional, the respondents correctly instituted Civil Case No. R-7646 to finally settle the issue of ownership. The Court cited established jurisprudence, including *Ongsinco vs. Borja* and *Mallari vs. Mallari*, to support the doctrine that ownership disputes belong in a separate action [5].

Petition for prohibition **DENIED** and the writ of preliminary injunction is **DISSOLVED** [6].
