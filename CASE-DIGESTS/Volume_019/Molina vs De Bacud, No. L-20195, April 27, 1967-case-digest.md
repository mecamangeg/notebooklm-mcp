I. CAPTION
HEIRS OF JULIAN MOLINA, ET AL. v. HONORIA VDA. DE BACUD and COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-20195, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Honoria Vda. de Bacud (Respondent) filed a case claiming ownership and possession of two parcels of land in San Mariano, Isabela, which she inherited from her mother, Catalina Siccuan. Siccuan had been in open, continuous, and adverse possession of the lands since 1916 and declared them for taxation in 1919 [1, 2]. Julian Molina (predecessor of Petitioners) entered the property in 1936 and claimed rights based on a sales application approved by the Director of Lands in 1937 [2]. Bacud protested the sale administratively but eventually filed this suit in 1950 [3]. The trial court declared the land part of the public domain but upheld Bacud’s prior possessory rights, ordering the cancellation of Molina’s sales application. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision [3]. Petitioners argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the disposition of public lands is vested exclusively in the Director of Lands under the Public Land Act [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the courts have jurisdiction over possessory actions involving public lands despite the authority of the Director of Lands.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The authority given to the Lands Department over the disposition of public lands does not exclude the courts from their jurisdiction over possessory actions, the public character of the land notwithstanding [5]. The fact that the plaintiff claims ownership in such an action does not change its nature, as the allegation of ownership is regarded as mere surplusage [5]. Furthermore, the Respondent’s open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession for over 30 years entitled her to a grant under Section 48(b) of Com. Act No. 141, and the Director of Lands could not validly approve a sales application in favor of Molina over occupied land [6]. Under Article 538 of the Civil Code, possession as a fact cannot be recognized at the same time in two different personalities; thus, the Respondent’s prior possession prevails [7]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
