I. CAPTION
PROCTER & GAMBLE PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING CORPORATION v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22819, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1958, petitioner Procter & Gamble consigned two shipments of caustic soda from San Francisco, which arrived in Manila Bay on board foreign vessels [1]. The vessels anchored outside the breakwater and unloaded the cargo onto lighters, which were then towed to petitioner's private wharf in Tondo, Manila [1]. The Collector of Customs levied P720.00 in wharfage dues on the shipments pursuant to Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code (Republic Act No. 1937) [2]. Petitioner protested the payment, arguing that it was exempt because it did not use a government wharf or facility to unload the merchandise [2]. The Collector denied the protest. On appeal, the Commissioner of Customs and subsequently the Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the Collector's decision [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is liable for the payment of wharfage dues under Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code for cargo unloaded on a private wharf without using government piers. [3]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [4]. The Court held that under Section 2802 of the Tariff and Customs Code (R.A. 1937), wharfage dues are assessed against the cargo discharged by a vessel engaged in foreign trade [5].

While the previous law (Section 3 of R.A. 1371) contained a proviso specifically exempting cargo unloaded on private wharves from wharfage fees, Section 2802 of the enacted Tariff and Customs Code (R.A. 1937) omitted this proviso [6-8]. The Court reasoned that vessels and cargoes derive benefit from the port facilities and safety provided and maintained by the Government, even if they do not physically use a government pier [9]. Since the cargo was unloaded "amidst the safety afforded by the port," it is chargeable with wharfage dues, which partake of the nature of a tax collected by the Government to support its customs service operations [4].

The petition is denied and the decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
