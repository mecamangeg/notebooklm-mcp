I. CAPTION
ERNESTO A. PAPA and CONRADO V. ATANACIO v. SEVERO J. SANTIAGO, G.R. Nos. L-16204 & L-16256, April 24, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Papa and Atanacio and respondent Santiago were competing applicants for a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate a telephone system in Pasig, Rizal. The Public Service Commission (PSC) initially granted the CPC to Santiago, finding him financially and technically superior with equipment ready for immediate use. On appeal, the Supreme Court (in a 1962 decision) reversed the PSC and awarded the CPC to Papa, citing his prior municipal franchise and successful bidding, while alleging Santiago engaged in illegal operations and would create a monopoly.

Santiago filed a Motion for Reconsideration. The Court remanded the case to the PSC to receive evidence on Papa's financial ability. The rehearing revealed that Papa’s co-applicant, Atanacio, had withdrawn from the partnership as early as 1957. Furthermore, Papa had listed essential cable equipment he did not actually own (holding only an option to buy which he failed to exercise), and which was eventually sold to Santiago’s company. Papa had concealed these material facts from the PSC.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Certificate of Public Convenience should be awarded to Santiago despite Papa's priority in application and municipal franchise.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reconsidered and set aside its previous decision, affirming the PSC's award to Santiago.

The cardinal rule in public service cases is to adhere to what is best for the interest of the public (*In re Gregorio*). The evidence established that Santiago was financially and technically superior, with a system installed and ready for immediate operation. In contrast, Papa's resources were meager, his equipment incomplete, and his initial application suffered from material concealment regarding the ownership of assets.

Priority in filing or winning a bid does not override the paramount regard for public interest. Moreover, since the municipal franchise was granted to Papa *and* Atanacio jointly, granting the CPC to Papa alone would constitute an unauthorized amendment of the franchise without the grantor's consent.

Regarding the argument on monopoly, the Court ruled that while the doctrine against monopolistic trends is valid in transportation and merchandising, it is "less valid in the sphere of telephone communication," where efficiency and utility depend on a unified system and the facility of interconnection (*Benitez v. Santos* distinguished). Finally, the Court reiterated that the factual findings of the PSC should not be disturbed as long as they are supported by evidence (*Ynchausti v. Public Utility Commission*).

Judgment of Commission affirmed; prior decision of the Supreme Court set aside.
