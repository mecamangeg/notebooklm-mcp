I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO C. MANABAT v. LAGUNA FEDERATION OF FACOMAS, INC., ET AL., G.R. No. L-23888, March 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Pursuant to a judgment in favor of Laguna Federation of Facomas, Inc. against Nieves M. Vda. de Roxas, the Provincial Sheriff of Laguna, Francisco Manabat, sold ten parcels of land belonging to Roxas at a public auction for P37,000.00 [1]. Upon discovering that the properties were subject to various registered liens, such as writs of execution and attachment annotated on the titles, Manabat instituted an action for interpleader to allow the different creditors to litigate their claims over the proceeds [2].

The Court of First Instance of Laguna ruled that the claimants were entitled to the proceeds in the order of preference based on the dates of the registration of their credits [3]. Defendants Florentino Cayco and Jose Fernandez Zorilla appealed, arguing that under Article 2249 of the Civil Code, the credits should be satisfied *pro rata* since they refer to the same specific real property [4]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved a pure question of law [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the credits annotated by attachments and executions on the same real property should be satisfied *pro rata*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the rule is preference according to the priority of the credits in the order of time [5, 6].

While Article 2249 of the Civil Code generally establishes a *pro rata* rule for credits referring to the same specific real property, this rule does not apply to credits mentioned in Article 2242(7) [7, 8]. Article 2242(7) expressly states that credits annotated in the Registry of Property by virtue of judicial orders (attachments or executions) are preferred "only as to later credits" [8]. This language mandates that preference is determined by the order of registration. To satisfy these credits *pro rata* would absurdly erase the distinction between earlier and later credits and defeat the preference granted to earlier attachments [6, 9].

The judgment appealed from ruling preference is affirmed [9].
