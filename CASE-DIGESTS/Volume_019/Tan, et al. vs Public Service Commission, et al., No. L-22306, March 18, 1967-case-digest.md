I. CAPTION
FELICITAS C. TAN, EUGENIO GALVEZ, EMIGDIO MERCADO, CEBU YELLOW TAXI (MANILA YELLOW TAXICAB Co., INC. & CEBU CHECKERED CAB Co., INC,) v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION and ANTONIO DE PIO, G.R. No. L-22306, March 18, 1967, 19 SCRA 896, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Antonio De Pio filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate 25 taxicab units in Cebu [1]. Petitioners, existing operators, opposed the application [1]. Petitioner Tan mailed her opposition on September 30, 1963, but before it reached the PSC, the Commission issued an order on October 4, 1963, delegating the reception of evidence to the Municipal Judge of Cebu City [2]. Because her opposition had not yet been received, Tan was not listed as an oppositor and was not officially notified of the hearings held in November 1963 [2].

The PSC subsequently granted De Pio a certificate to operate 15 units, finding public necessity based on the existence of "colorum" cars and the fact that no new units had been authorized since 1960 despite population growth [3], [4].

Tan filed a petition for review, arguing denial of due process due to lack of notice [5], [6]. However, she did not file a motion for reconsideration or ask for a new trial before the PSC, nor did she specify in her petition what evidence she would have presented [6]. The other petitioners challenged the finding of public necessity [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner Tan was denied due process such that the decision should be reversed.
2. W/N there is a public necessity for the additional taxicab units.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Tan has no cause for complaint because she failed to show she suffered substantial injury [6]. Tan did not move for the reconsideration of the Commission’s decision nor ask for a new trial to present her evidence [6]. Furthermore, her petition for review failed to specify what evidence, if any, she would introduce if a new trial were ordered [6]. The Court relied on the doctrine that without a showing of substantial injury or a proffer of evidence that could alter the outcome, a claim of denial of due process in this context will not prosper, citing *Litam v. Li Tan & Co.* and *Suzara v. Caluag* [6].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the PSC's finding of public necessity [7]. The Commission correctly disregarded the testimony of the oppositors' witnesses, who were mostly their own employees and thus biased [8]. The oppositors' admission regarding the existence of "colorum" cars indicated a demand for transportation [3]. The Court applied the principle that it will not disturb the PSC's factual findings and evaluation of witness credibility as long as the version accepted is not inherently improbable [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
