I. CAPTION
JOSE KATIGBAK v. RICARDO MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-24477, February 28, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 1963 local elections for Vice-Mayor of Padre Garcia, Batangas, the Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Ricardo Mendoza the winner with 1,327 votes, while Jose Katigbak obtained 1,310 votes. Katigbak filed an election protest. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas rendered judgment declaring Katigbak the winner by a single vote (1,308 to 1,307), after rejecting several of Mendoza's ballots as "marked" due to identical handwriting patterns or specific markings. Mendoza appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law regarding the appreciation of these ballots.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N ballots containing names written in an identical manner or pattern by different voters are void as marked ballots.
2. W/N the writing of a candidate's name more than twice on a ballot renders it void.
3. W/N parallel or curved lines drawn on empty spaces invalidate the ballot.
4. W/N a vote using only a nickname without a surname is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The mere fact that several voters wrote the names of candidates in an identical manner does not justify the inference of a plan to identify votes. The determinative factor for nullifying ballots as marked is the existence of *evidence aliunde* showing an intention to identify the ballot. An identification mark cannot be presumed [1].

2. **YES.** Writing a name more than twice on the ballot is considered intentional and serves no other purpose than to identify the ballot, thus rendering it void [2]. However, a name written only twice does not invalidate the ballot absent evidence of intent to identify [3].

3. **NO.** Two short parallel lines or curved lines resembling parentheses placed on spaces where the voter did not vote merely indicate the voter’s desistance from voting. Under Rule 17 of the Rules for the appreciation of ballots (Section 149, Revised Election Code), such signs do not invalidate the ballot [4, 5].

4. **NO.** A vote using only a nickname (e.g., "Pepe") without being accompanied by the candidate's surname is not valid. This is in accordance with Rule 9, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code [6].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and Ricardo Mendoza is declared the Vice-Mayor elect [7].
