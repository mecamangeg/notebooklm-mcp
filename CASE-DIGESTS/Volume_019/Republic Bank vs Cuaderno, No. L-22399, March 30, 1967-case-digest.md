I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC BANK, represented in this action by DAMASO P. PEREZ v. MIGUEL CUADERNO, BIENVENIDO DIZON, PABLO ROMAN, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REPUBLIC BANK and THE MONETARY BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22399, March 30, 1967, 19 SCRA 671, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Damaso Perez, a stockholder of Republic Bank, filed a derivative suit on behalf of the Bank against Miguel Cuaderno, Bienvenido Dizon, Pablo Roman, and the Bank's Board of Directors. Perez alleged that Roman, as former Chairman, fraudulently granted P4 million in loans to fictitious persons. To shield himself from prosecution, Roman allegedly connived with the Board (his nominees) to appoint Cuaderno as a technical consultant with excessive compensation and Dizon as Board Chairman. Perez claimed these appointments were made in bad faith to protect Roman, not for the Bank's interest, resulting in a waste of corporate funds. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing Perez lacked the capacity to sue without corporate authority and that the suit was effectively a *quo warranto* proceeding. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and due to the pendency of other cases between the parties.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an individual stockholder may institute a derivative suit without corporate authority when the directors control the corporation.
2. W/N the complaint states a sufficient cause of action.
3. W/N the suit is an improper *quo warranto* proceeding.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** An individual stockholder may institute a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation to protect corporate rights whenever the officials of the corporation refuse to sue, or are the ones to be sued, or hold control of the corporation. In such cases, the stockholder is a nominal party, and the corporation is the real party in interest (*Pascual v. Del Saz Orozco*). Since Perez alleged the Directors were Roman’s nominees, a demand for intra-corporate remedy would have been futile, dispensing with the need for corporate authorization.

2. **YES.** The facts pleaded, which are hypothetically admitted in a motion to dismiss, constitute a cause of action. If the appointments were made solely to protect Roman from criminal prosecution, the disbursement of funds for salaries constitutes unlawful wastage and a breach of trust. The Bank has a right to sue to nullify such appointments and recover the funds (*Angeles v. Santos*). The test of sufficiency is whether the Court can render a valid judgment assuming the facts alleged are true.

3. **NO.** This is not a *quo warranto* proceeding because the plaintiff is not claiming title to the positions held by the defendants. The suit aims to prevent the diversion of corporate funds for the payment of salaries to officials appointed for an anomalous purpose.

The Order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None.
