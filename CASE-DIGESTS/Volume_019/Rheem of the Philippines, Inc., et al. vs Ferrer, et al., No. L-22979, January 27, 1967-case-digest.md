I. CAPTION
RHEEM OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. and GORDON W. MACKAY v. ZOILO R. FERRER, MARIO TATLONGHARI, SANTOS MARILAG and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22979, January 27, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Zoilo Ferrer, Mario Tatlonghari, and Santos Marilag filed a complaint against petitioners Rheem of the Philippines, Inc. and Gordon W. Mackay in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). They sought reinstatement with back wages, moral and exemplary damages, salary increases, separation pay, night differential pay, and premium pay for work done on Sundays and legal holidays [1, 2]. Petitioners filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. The CIR denied the motion and refused to reconsider [2]. Petitioners then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition before the Supreme Court challenging the CIR's jurisdiction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the respondents' claims for reinstatement, damages, and additional compensation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the CIR has jurisdiction over all the claims.

Regarding the claim for additional pay for Sundays and legal holidays, the Court applied the rule in *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*, which states that the CIR acquires jurisdiction when the claimant seeks reinstatement and the controversy arises under the Eight-Hour Labor Law [3, 4]. Since respondents sought reinstatement, the claim falls within CIR jurisdiction [3].

Regarding night differentials, the Court affirmed that the CIR has the power to determine wages for night work (distinct from overtime) for hygienic, medical, moral, cultural, and sociological reasons, citing *Shell Co. v. National Labor Union* and *Philippine Engineers’ Syndicate v. Bautista* [5-7].

For the remaining demands (damages, salary increases, separation pay), the Court held that since the employer-employee relationship is sought to be re-established through reinstatement, the CIR has jurisdiction over *all claims* arising out of the employment [8]. The Court emphasized that splitting jurisdiction would lead to a multiplicity of suits, wasted effort, and prejudice to labor [9, 10].

The petition for certiorari and prohibition was dismissed [10].
