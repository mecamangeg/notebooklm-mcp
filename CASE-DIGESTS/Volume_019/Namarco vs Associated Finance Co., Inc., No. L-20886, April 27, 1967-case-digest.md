I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION (NAMARCO) v. ASSOCIATED FINANCE COMPANY, INC. and FRANCISCO SYCIP, G.R. No. L-20886, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On March 25, 1958, Associated Finance Company, Inc. (ASSOCIATED), through its President Francisco Sycip, entered into an agreement to exchange 22,516 bags of refined sugar for raw sugar belonging to National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO) [1]. NAMARCO complied and delivered its raw sugar in May 1958, but ASSOCIATED failed to deliver the refined sugar [1]. NAMARCO demanded performance or payment of P403,514.28, but ASSOCIATED refused, offering a lower sum instead [1], [2].

Evidence showed that Sycip and his wife owned the majority of ASSOCIATED's subscribed capital stock and that Sycip exclusively negotiated the agreement, treating it as his personal contract [3]. Sycip falsely represented that the sugar was in ASSOCIATED's possession and ready for delivery, despite knowing the corporation was insolvent and incapable of complying [4].

NAMARCO filed a complaint for sum of money. The Court of First Instance of Manila ordered ASSOCIATED to pay the amount but dismissed the complaint against Sycip personally [5], [1]. NAMARCO appealed solely on the dismissal of Sycip's liability [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Francisco Sycip is jointly and severally liable with Associated Finance Company, Inc. for the corporate obligation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Sycip is solidarily liable. While a corporation generally has a personality distinct from its stockholders, this fiction may be disregarded when the corporation is the mere *alter ego* of a person or used as an instrumentality of another [6].

Sycip was guilty of fraud because he induced NAMARCO to enter the contract through false representations regarding the availability of the sugar, knowing fully well that ASSOCIATED—over which he had absolute control—was insolvent and could not comply [4], [6]. Consequently, the Court justified "piercing the veil of corporate fiction" to hold Sycip personally liable for the sums adjudged, citing *Koppel Phils. vs. Yatco* and *Yutivo Sons vs. Court of Tax Appeals* [6].

The appealed decision was **MODIFIED**, sentencing Francisco Sycip to pay, jointly and severally with ASSOCIATED, the sum of P403,514.28 plus liquidated damages and attorney's fees [7].
