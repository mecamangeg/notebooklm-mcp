I. CAPTION
CITY OF MANILA v. GERARDO GARCIA, et al., G.R. No. L-26053, February 21, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The City of Manila owns several parcels of land in Malate, Manila. From 1945 to 1947, Gerardo Garcia and other defendants entered the premises without the City’s knowledge or consent and constructed houses without building permits. In 1947 and 1948, the Mayor of Manila issued written permits, labeled as "lease contracts," to some of the defendants, allowing them to occupy specific areas. These permits were revocable upon thirty days' notice.

In 1961, the City Engineer demanded that the defendants vacate the premises within 30 days to allow for the expansion of the Epifanio de los Santos Elementary School. The defendants refused to vacate. The City filed a suit for recovery of possession in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of the City, ordering the defendants to vacate and pay rentals. The defendants appealed, arguing that they had acquired the legal status of tenants through the Mayor's permits and questioning the CFI's jurisdiction.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the permits issued by the Mayor legalized the defendants' occupancy and gave them the status of tenants.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the defendants are squatters, having entered the land and built houses without the owner's consent or necessary building permits [1]. The Mayor of Manila cannot legalize forcible entry into public property through the expedient of issuing permits or leases. Squatting is unlawful, and no amount of acquiescence by city officials can elevate it to a lawful act [2]. The permits granted were null and void as they failed to "safeguard" the city's land as required by the Manila Charter [2, 3]. Furthermore, the houses constituted a public nuisance *per se* under Article 694(5) of the Civil Code because they hindered and impaired the use of the property for a badly needed school building, impeding the government's constitutional obligation to provide public education [4]. As nuisances, they could have been summarily abated even without judicial action [5].

2. **YES.** The defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the CFI, arguing the case should have been filed in the municipal court as a forcible entry case. However, the Court ruled that the forcible entry dates back to the period between 1945 and 1947, and the suit was instituted in 1962, long after the one-year limitation for forcible entry suits in municipal courts had expired. Therefore, the suit was an *accion publiciana* (recovery of the right to possess) which falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [5].

Judgment affirmed [6].
