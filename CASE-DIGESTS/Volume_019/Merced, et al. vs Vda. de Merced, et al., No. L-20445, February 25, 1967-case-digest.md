I. CAPTION
ANICIA V. MERCED, CANDELARIO V. MERCED, CONCEPCION V. MERCED, ATILANO V. MERCED, JR., and JOSEFINA V. MERCED v. COLOMBINA VDA. DE MERCED, BRICCIO MERCED, JR., and the SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-20445, February 25, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1957, while single, Briccio Merced, an employee of Community Export and Import Corporation, became a member of the Social Security System (SSS) and designated his brothers and sisters (petitioners) as his beneficiaries [1]. On May 29, 1960, Briccio married respondent Colombina Vda. de Merced, with whom he had a child, Briccio, Jr. [1]. On June 18, 1960, Republic Act No. 2658 was enacted, amending the Social Security Act [2]. Briccio died on February 22, 1961, without changing his designated beneficiaries [1].

Petitioners filed a claim for death benefits, but the SSS denied it, ruling that their designation was void and awarding the benefits to the widow and child instead [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Social Security Commission, which affirmed the SSS Administrator's decision [3]. Petitioners then filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court, arguing that the original designation should be respected [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the deceased's brothers and sisters, designated as beneficiaries before his marriage, are entitled to the death benefits over the surviving spouse and child under the amended Social Security Law.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the benefits accruing under the Social Security Law vest only upon the death of the employee [5]. Prior to death, the rights of designated beneficiaries are purely inchoate [5].

At the time of Briccio’s death in 1961, Republic Act No. 2658 was already in effect. This law amended Section 8 of the Social Security Act to strictly limit beneficiaries to the legitimate spouse and descendants [6]. Brothers and sisters may only be designated in default of a spouse, children, or parents [2]. Since Briccio was survived by his widow and child, they are the rightful beneficiaries by operation of law, rendering the prior designation of his siblings void [7]. Furthermore, Section 30 of the original Act expressly reserved the Legislature's right to amend the law, preventing any rights from vesting prior to the event of death [5].

The resolution of the Social Security Commission is affirmed [8].
