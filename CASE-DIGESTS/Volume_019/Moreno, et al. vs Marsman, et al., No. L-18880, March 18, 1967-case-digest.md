I. CAPTION
HECTOR MORENO, ET AL. v. MARY A. MARSMAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18880, March 18, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 28, 1960, Hector Moreno and other members of Marsman Investments, Ltd. (a British company) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against Mary A. Marsman (Chairman and Director) and other directors. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin Marsman from presiding over the scheduled Annual General Meeting (AGM) of stockholders, where the ratification of the sale of 76% of the company's holdings in Marsman & Company (a domestic corporation) to Mary Marsman was to be discussed.

The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction ordering Marsman to refrain from presiding over the "Annual General Meeting of December 28, 1960 and such other meetings as have been lawfully called" regarding the disputed sale. On January 17, 1961, Marsman called and presided over a meeting of the *Board of Directors*, where they elected a new director and officers. The plaintiffs moved to cite her for contempt, arguing she violated the injunction. The CFI found Marsman guilty of contempt and fined her P100.00, ruling that the injunction covered all meetings, including those of the Board. Marsman appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Mary Marsman is liable for contempt of court for presiding over a Board of Directors meeting.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the appealed order and absolved Mary Marsman from the contempt charge.

The Court held that the injunctions issued by the lower court on December 28 and 29, 1960, explicitly restrained Marsman from presiding over the "Annual General Meeting" and referred to the "general body of members." There is a clear distinction between a meeting of the Board of Directors and a meeting of the company's stockholders. The purpose of the complaint and the injunction was specifically to prevent Marsman from participating in or presiding over the AGM only insofar as the ratification of the alleged sale of stockholdings was concerned. Since she presided over a Board meeting, not the Annual General Meeting of stockholders, she did not violate the specific terms of the injunction.

The order appealed from is reversed and appellant Mary Marsman is absolved from the charge of contempt of court.
