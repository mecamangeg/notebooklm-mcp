I. CAPTION
MERALCO WORKERS UNION v. THE HONORABLE JUDGE NICASIO YATCO and MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, G.R. No. L-19785, January 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On May 3, 1962, petitioner Meralco Workers Union declared a strike against respondent Manila Electric Company [1]. On May 15, 1962, the Company filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, presided by respondent Judge Yatco, seeking a preliminary injunction to restrain the Union from obstructing access to company premises and intimidating non-striking employees [2]. After a summary hearing establishing acts of violence—such as blocking food supplies, assaulting an employee, and sawing off a transmission tower—the trial court issued the writ of preliminary injunction on May 18, 1962 [1, 3-5].

The Union filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, questioning the lower court's jurisdiction [6]. However, on May 30, 1962, the Union and the Company entered into a "Return to Work Agreement," which settled the labor dispute and ended the strike [7]. Consequently, the Company moved to dismiss the petition as moot, but the Union objected, arguing that a ruling was necessary to support its claim for damages due to the alleged improper issuance of the injunction [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari has become moot due to the execution of the "Return to Work Agreement."
2. W/N the Union is entitled to damages resulting from the issuance of the preliminary injunction.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the case had become moot. By virtue of the "Return to Work Agreement," the labor dispute was settled, and the strike and picketing ended [7]. Since the acts restrained by the writ of preliminary injunction no longer exist, there is no practical relief to be granted [7, 9]. It is a settled rule that a court will not determine moot questions or abstract propositions [7, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the injunction cannot be a ground for damages. The writ did not prohibit the strike or picketing itself, but rather specific acts of violence and intimidation which are unlawful [8, 11]. An order prohibiting the commission of such unlawful acts cannot conceivably be a basis for a claim for damages [8]. Furthermore, the amicable settlement contained no reservation regarding any contemplated claim for damages [8, 11].

The petition is dismissed [12].
