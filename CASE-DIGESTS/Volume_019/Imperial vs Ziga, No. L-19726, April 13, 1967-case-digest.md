I. CAPTION
DOMINGO IMPERIAL v. VENANCIO P. ZIGA and ANASTACIA V. DE MUÑOZ (substituted by APOLONIO R. MUÑOZ), G.R. No. L-19726, April 13, 1967, 19 SCRA 726, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Domingo Imperial filed an action for damages against Gov. Venancio P. Ziga and Anastacia V. de Muñoz for libel. The action was based on three documents: (1) a distributed article titled "History of the Last Elections in Albay" (Exh. F), which claimed Imperial sought to perpetuate his leadership for corrupt purposes; and (2) two letters (Exh. N and Q) sent to the Commission on Appointments (CA) opposing Imperial’s confirmation as COMELEC Chairman [1-3]. These letters, signed by Muñoz but allegedly caused by Ziga, accused Imperial of lack of integrity, nepotism, smuggling, and election fraud [4-6].

The defendants denied authorship and argued the letters to the CA were privileged communications [7]. The Court of First Instance of Albay found Ziga and Muñoz liable for libel and ordered them to pay P20,000 in moral damages [8]. Both parties appealed; Imperial sought exemplary damages and interest, while defendants questioned the finding of libel [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Ziga is the author of the libelous documents despite Muñoz signing the letters to the Commission on Appointments.
2. W/N the letters sent to the Commission on Appointments are privileged communications that exempt the defendants from liability.
3. W/N the plaintiff is entitled to interest on moral damages and the award of exemplary damages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The evidence proved Ziga authored and distributed the article (Exh. F) [7]. Regarding the letters to the CA (Exh. N and Q), although signed by Muñoz, the Court found sufficient evidence that Ziga was the real author who used Muñoz as a tool to vent his political bitterness against Imperial [10, 11].

2. **NO.** While a communication sent to the Commission on Appointments regarding an appointee generally possesses the color of a qualified privileged communication, this privilege is defeated by proof of **actual malice** under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code [12]. The Court found actual malice because the author attempted to conceal his identity by using Muñoz, failed to prove the truth of the serious imputations, and was motivated by extreme bitterness [12, 13].

3. **YES (as to interest) and NO (as to exemplary damages).** The Court affirmed the P20,000 moral damages award, ruling that legal interest should be imposed from the date of the lower court's decision (December 10, 1959) [14]. However, the claim for exemplary damages was denied because its recovery is not a matter of right under Article 2233 of the Civil Code, and the lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying it [9].

The decision of the lower court is **MODIFIED** to include the payment of legal interest on the moral damages and is affirmed in all other respects [15].
