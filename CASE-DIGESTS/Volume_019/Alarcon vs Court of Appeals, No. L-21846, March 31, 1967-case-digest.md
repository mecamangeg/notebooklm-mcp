I. CAPTION
ROMEO ALARCON v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21846, March 31, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Romeo Alarcon, a representative of Magpayo & Basa Brokerage, sought the release of four cases of camphor chests from the Manila Port Service on February 2, 1959. To do so, he used a delivery permit (Exhibit C) containing a falsified certification from a fictitious customs examiner, implying duties were paid and the cargo examined. His companion also presented a falsified authority from the alleged consignee, Rufino Achacoso, who later testified he never imported the goods nor executed the documents. Alarcon paid the arrastre fees, secured the gate pass, hired a truck, and accompanied the cargo to a residence in Quezon City.

The Court of First Instance of Manila convicted Alarcon of estafa thru falsification of an official or public document. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. Alarcon petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing he did not forge the permit nor cause its forgery.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner is criminally liable for falsification of the public document despite the lack of direct evidence that he personally forged the signature.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, applying the legal presumption that in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, a person found in possession of and who used a forged document is the forger or the one who caused the forgery.

The Court reasoned that Alarcon's claim of innocence was incredible given his "extraordinary interest" in the goods and his direct participation in the release and delivery of the cargo using the falsified papers. As a customs broker's representative, he was deemed to have knowledge of the irregularity. The Court relied on established jurisprudence, including *People v. De Lara* and *People v. Cu Unjieng*, to sustain the presumption of authorship against the user of the forged instrument.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.
