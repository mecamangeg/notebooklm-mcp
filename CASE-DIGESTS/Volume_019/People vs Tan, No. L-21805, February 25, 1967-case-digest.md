I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FIDEL TAN, G.R. No. L-21805, February 25, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Fidel Tan was convicted and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 2 years and 4 months to 4 years and 2 months of *prision correccional* [1]. After the sentence became final, he was committed to the Director of Prisons on March 2, 1959, through the provincial warden of Samar [1]. However, the warden did not transfer Tan to the national penitentiary, keeping him instead in the provincial jail [2]. The warden unilaterally credited Tan with Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) under Articles 97 and 99 of the Revised Penal Code and released him on November 23, 1961, after Tan had served only 2 years, 8 months, and 21 days [2]. The Provincial Fiscal moved for Tan’s rearrest, arguing the warden lacked authority to grant GCTA [2]. The Court of First Instance of Samar denied the motion, ruling it had lost jurisdiction to amend the judgment [3, 4]. The People appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provincial warden has the authority to credit Good Conduct Time Allowance to a prisoner.
2. W/N the rearrest of the prisoner constitutes double jeopardy or deprives him of liberty without due process.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is no justification for the provincial warden to usurp the authority of the Director of Prisons. Under Article 99 of the Revised Penal Code, the authority to credit a prisoner with Good Conduct Time Allowance is vested **exclusively** in the Director of Prisons [5]. Furthermore, as Tan was sentenced to more than one year, he was a national (insular) prisoner, and the warden committed a breach of duty by failing to remit him to the national penitentiary [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Tan's rearrest would not place him twice in jeopardy because his re-incarceration is merely a **continuation of the penalty** that he had not completely served due to the erroneous act of the warden; it is not a new or subsequent conviction [7, 8]. Neither does it violate due process, as Tan was not yet entitled to liberty at the time of his release [8]. While the lower court lost jurisdiction to amend the conviction, it retained jurisdiction to ensure the penalty is served until satisfied or lawfully lifted [9].

**WHEREFORE**, the appealed order is reversed, and a new one entered ordering the rearrest and continuance of imprisonment of Fidel Tan [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
