**I. CAPTION**
**DIOSCORO V. ASTORGA v. HON. FIDEL FERNANDEZ, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Samar and EDITA LIM**, G.R. No. L-22568, February 10, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Dioscoro V. Astorga and private respondent Edita Lim were candidates for mayor of Daram, Samar in the November 12, 1963 elections. Lim was proclaimed the winner with a margin of 40 votes [1]. Astorga filed an election protest alleging that in Precinct No. 12, the board of inspectors illegally read and credited to Lim approximately 80 ballots that were actually cast for him [1].

During the hearing, Astorga moved to open the ballot box of Precinct No. 12 to recount the votes. Respondent Judge Fidel Fernandez denied the motion, ruling that the box would be opened only *after* the court was convinced by other evidence that the alleged irregularities actually existed [2]. Astorga’s motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting him to file a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court, arguing that the Judge’s refusal constituted grave abuse of discretion [3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to open the ballot box until other evidence of irregularity was presented.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion. The Court reasoned that when a protestant alleges that ballots cast for them were wrongly credited to an opponent, "the simplest, the most expeditious and the best means to determine the truth or falsity of this allegation is to open the ballot box and examine its contents" [4].

The Court rejected the trial court's requirement for parol or other evidence prior to opening the box as "extremely technical and highly impractical" [4]. Such a procedure would allow the protestee to delay the settlement of the controversy through lengthy cross-examination, effectively defeating the purpose of the election protest [4]. Relying on *Cecilio v. Belmonte* and *Pareja v. Narvasa*, the Court emphasized that the law (Section 175 of the Election Code) eliminates technicalities standing in the way of a prompt examination of ballots [5, 6].

**Petition granted.** The orders complained of are set aside, and the respondent Judge is directed to immediately open the ballot box and proceed with the examination of its contents [7].
