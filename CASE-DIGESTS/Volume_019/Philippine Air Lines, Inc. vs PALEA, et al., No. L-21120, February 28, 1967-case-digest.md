I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC. v. PHILIPPINE AIR LINES EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-21120, February 28, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On May 4, 1950, Philippine Air Lines (PAL) dismissed four employees. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered their reinstatement with back wages "from the date of their dismissal to the date of their reinstatement, and without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges" [1]. This order was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1958, and the employees were reinstated in 1959 [1], [2]. PALEA moved for the execution of "other rights and privileges" covering the layoff period, specifically claiming: (1) Christmas bonuses; (2) accumulated sick leave; (3) transportation allowances; and (4) free trip passes [2], [3]. The CIR granted these benefits (with some exceptions regarding sick leave limits), ruling they were owed [4], [3]. PAL appealed, arguing these privileges were not specifically mentioned in the 1954 resolution and that the "without prejudice" clause should be applied prospectively [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N reinstated employees are entitled to Christmas bonuses, accumulated sick leave, transportation allowances, and free trip passes for the period they were laid off.

IV. RULING
**YES, regarding the Christmas bonus, sick leave, and transportation allowance.** The Court held that the phrase "without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges" was intended to restore the employees to their status immediately prior to dismissal [5]. The reinstatement order implies that employees are to be treated as if they had not been absent from work and had been uninterruptedly working during the layoff period [6]. Therefore, they are entitled to the Christmas bonus (which had become part of regular compensation), transportation allowance, and sick leave privileges (subject to the 140-day limit per the collective bargaining agreement) [7].

**NO, regarding the free trip passes.** The employees had no absolute right to free trip passes, as these were given neither automatically nor indiscriminately [8]. Such passes required application and company approval [8].

**Resolution modified.** The CIR order is affirmed, except regarding the grant of free trip passes which is reversed [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. (Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred) [9].
