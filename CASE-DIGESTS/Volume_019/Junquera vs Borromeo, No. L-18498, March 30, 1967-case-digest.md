I. CAPTION
**TESTATE ESTATE OF VITO BORROMEO. JOSE H. JUNQUERA v. CRISPIN BORROMEO, ET AL.,** G.R. No. L-18498, March 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Vito Borromeo died on March 13, 1952, leaving extensive properties in Cebu. Jose H. Junquera filed a petition for the probate of a one-page will allegedly executed on May 17, 1945, devising all properties to Tomas, Fortunato, and Amelia Borromeo [1-3]. Oppositors (relatives of the deceased) contested the will, alleging forgery, lack of testamentary capacity, and undue influence [4, 5]. They presented evidence that on the date of alleged execution, the 82-year-old testator was paralyzed on the left side of his body, making the "perfect" signatures on the will impossible [6, 7].

During the proceedings, the instituted heirs also moved to exclude thirteen parcels of land from the estate inventory, claiming Vito had sold these lots to their partnership during his lifetime [8]. The Court of First Instance denied the probate of the will, citing the improbability of the signatures and the lack of credibility of the attesting witnesses. It also declared itself without jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the thirteen lots with finality [9]. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the will should be allowed probate.
2. W/N the probate court has jurisdiction to determine with finality the ownership of the lots excluded from the inventory.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of probate, holding that the testimony of attesting witnesses may be overcome by competent evidence, including the physical appearance of the document [10, 11]. The Court found the attesting witnesses (Gandionco, Leonardo, and Cabiluna) to be biased due to their close relationships with the instituted heirs and their conflicting testimony regarding the number of will copies executed [12, 13]. Furthermore, the Court gave credence to the physical evidence: the six alleged signatures of the testator were "firm," "well written," and "flawless," which was physically impossible for an 82-year-old man with a paralyzed left body to execute unaided [14]. The condition of the document "silently reveals the naked truth" and outweighs the testimony of biased witnesses [11]. The blurred thumbmarks were also deemed unidentifiable [15].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a probate court has no jurisdiction to determine with finality the question of ownership of properties [16]. While a probate court may pass upon the question of inclusion or exclusion from the inventory provisionally, the issue of ownership must be litigated in a separate action [16].

**Disposition:** Judgment affirmed.
