I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF TAN TIAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN TIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19899, March 18, 1967, 19 SCRA 896, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Tian filed a petition for naturalization, which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur [1, 2]. The Solicitor General appealed, raising three main objections. First, Tan Tian failed to state his former places of residence in his application, mentioning only his current residence in Candon, Ilocos Sur [2, 3]. Records showed he previously resided in Tubao, La Union, Panangaan, Mountain Province, and Manila [3]. Second, several of his children were enrolled in Chinese schools (Ilocos Sur Chinese School, La Union Chinese School, and Chiang Kai Shek High School) [4]. Third, despite having 11 children (9 of whom were schooling), his annual net income from 1958 to 1960 ranged only between P8,774.20 and P10,510.54 [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to allege all former places of residence is fatal to the petition for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner evinced a sincere desire to embrace Filipino customs and traditions despite enrolling his children in Chinese schools.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade, profession, or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The failure to allege former places of residence in the application justifies the denial of the application. The Court held that such omission is fatal to the petition, citing *Ong Tai v. Republic* and *Go v. Republic* [3].

2. **NO.** The enrollment of the petitioner’s children in Chinese schools, the bulk of whose students are Chinese and for whom the institutions are primarily intended, negates a sincere desire to embrace the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipino people. The Court relied on *Li Tong Pek v. Republic* regarding this requirement [4].

3. **NO.** Considering the petitioner has 11 children, nine of whom are schooling, an annual net income of less than P10,000 cannot be considered lucrative in view of the high and increasing cost of living. The Court cited *Tan King Book v. Republic* in determining the sufficiency of income [5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the petition for naturalization is **DISMISSED** [6].
