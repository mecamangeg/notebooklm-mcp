I. CAPTION
**LUCAS V. CAUTON v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and PABLO SANIDAD**, G.R. No. L-25467, April 27, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lucas V. Cauton and respondent Pablo Sanidad were candidates for Representative in the second district of Ilocos Sur during the November 9, 1965 elections. During the canvass, Sanidad noticed that the entries of votes in the election returns presented by the Provincial Treasurer for the municipalities of Candon, Santiago, and Sta. Cruz differed from the Liberal Party’s copies.

Sanidad petitioned the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to open the ballot boxes in said municipalities to retrieve the election returns deposited therein for use in the canvass. After hearing, the COMELEC found that the copies of the returns intended for the Municipal Treasurer, the COMELEC, and the Provincial Treasurer all bore uniform alterations regarding the votes for Representative. Consequently, the COMELEC issued a resolution on December 22, 1965, ordering the opening of the ballot boxes to retrieve the returns inside, solely to enable the aggrieved party to establish discrepancies for the purpose of a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code. Cauton filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that the COMELEC exceeded its jurisdiction and that the opening of boxes is only allowed for prosecution of election laws or administrative investigations, not to assist a party in a recount.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the COMELEC has the power to order the opening of ballot boxes to retrieve election returns for the purpose of establishing discrepancies to justify a judicial recount.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the COMELEC acted within its powers. Under the Constitution, the COMELEC has the duty to administer and enforce laws relative to the conduct of elections to ensure they are free, orderly, and honest. The Commission has the administrative and supervisory power to investigate the propriety of the canvass.

When the COMELEC is convinced that the election returns in the hands of the board of canvassers (and other copies outside the ballot box) are tampered with and do not reflect the true result, it is duty-bound to take necessary steps to obtain the proper basis for the canvass. The Court ruled that under Section 157 of the Revised Election Code, ballot boxes may be opened when they are the subject of an "official investigation" ordered by a "competent authority." The COMELEC is such a competent authority. Opening the boxes in this case served two valid purposes: (1) to secure a basis for the prosecution of election law violations, and (2) to afford the aggrieved party a basis for a judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code by ascertaining the condition of the copy inside the ballot box. To deny the Commission this means would hamper its constitutional mandate to ensure the purity of elections.

Petition denied.
