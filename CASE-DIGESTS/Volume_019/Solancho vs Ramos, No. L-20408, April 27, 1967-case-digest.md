I. CAPTION
NARCISO SOLANCHO v. JOSEFA RAMOS and ISMAEL CALDERON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20408, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On December 8, 1961, Narciso Solancho filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cagayan (Civil Case No. 1519) against Josefa Ramos and others to recover ownership and possession of a parcel of land. Solancho claimed he had been in possession since time immemorial until the defendants usurped it in 1959. Instead of filing an answer, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that an administrative case involving the same parties and land was pending before the Bureau of Lands. They contended the court lacked jurisdiction pending the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The CFI granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. Solancho moved for reconsideration, arguing inter alia that his free patent application had been withdrawn, but the CFI denied the motion. Solancho appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the pendency of an administrative case before the Bureau of Lands constitutes "another action pending" sufficient to justify the dismissal of a civil complaint.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. The Court explained that under Rule 16, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court, a ground for dismissal is that "there is *another action* pending between the same parties for the same cause." However, Rule 2, Section 1 defines an "action" as "an ordinary suit *in a court of justice*, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right." The Bureau of Lands is not a court of justice; therefore, an administrative proceeding pending before it does not qualify as "another action" under the Rules of Court and is not a valid ground for dismissal.

The orders of the lower court were **REVERSED** and **SET ASIDE**, and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings.
