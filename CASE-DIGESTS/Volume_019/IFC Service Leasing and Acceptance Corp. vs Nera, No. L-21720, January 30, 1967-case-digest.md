I. CAPTION
IFC SERVICE LEASING AND ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION v. VENANCIO NERA, G.R. No. L-21720, January 30, 1967, Regala, J. [1]

II. FACTS
IFC Service Leasing (IFC) extrajudicially foreclosed a real estate mortgage on the spouses Nera's property in Quezon City. IFC purchased the property at the public auction on October 27, 1961 [2]. After the one-year redemption period expired without redemption, title was consolidated in IFC's name [2]. On February 26, 1963, the Court of First Instance of Rizal granted IFC's *ex parte* application for a writ of possession [3]. Nera moved to set aside the writ, arguing that the court's jurisdiction to issue such a writ is limited to the redemption period under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 [4, 5]. He contended that once the redemption period expires, the purchaser's remedy is to file a separate ordinary action for recovery of possession, citing *Luna v. Encarnacion* [4, 6]. The lower court denied Nera's motion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a separate ordinary action is necessary to secure possession of property sold in an extrajudicial foreclosure after the redemption period has expired. [4]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that an ordinary action is not necessary [1, 7].

The Court explained that Section 6 of Act No. 3135 applies the provisions of the Rules of Court regarding redemption in execution sales to extrajudicial foreclosures [6]. Specifically, Section 35, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court states that if no redemption is made within 12 months, the purchaser is entitled to conveyance and *possession* of the property, which shall be given by the officer unless a third party holds it adversely to the debtor [6, 8].

The Court cited *Tan Soo Huat v. Ongwico* (63 Phil. 746), holding that no law requires a purchaser to bring a separate independent suit for possession after the redemption period expires and the final certificate of sale is obtained [8, 9]. The Court also distinguished the case from *Luna v. Encarnacion*, noting that *Luna* involved a chattel mortgage, which lacks provisions similar to Sections 6 and 7 of Act No. 3135 [6, 10]. Thus, the court retains power to issue a writ of possession even after the redemption period [9].
