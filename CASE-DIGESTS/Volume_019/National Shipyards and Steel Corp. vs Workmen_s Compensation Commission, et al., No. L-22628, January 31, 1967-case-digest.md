I. CAPTION
NATIONAL SHIPYARDS AND STEEL CORPORATION (NASSCO) v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and DR. OLIVER CORONADO, G.R. No. L-22628, January 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Dr. Oliver Coronado was employed as a company physician at NASSCO’s Iligan Steel Mills with a monthly salary of P386.00 plus a housing allowance. While airlifting an emergency patient from Iligan City, he suffered "Angiospastic Retinopathy" in his left eye, resulting in 70% loss of vision [1]. He filed a claim with the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC). NASSCO opposed the claim, arguing that the Regional Office lacked jurisdiction, that Coronado was not covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act because he did not perform manual labor and earned more than P4,800 per annum, and that the evidence was insufficient [2-5]. During the proceedings, the hearing officer denied NASSCO's motion for postponement after it had already secured four previous postponements [6]. The Regional Office ruled in favor of Coronado, and the WCC affirmed the decision [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Regional Office of the WCC has jurisdiction to hear the claim.
2. W/N a company physician earning over P4,800 per annum is covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
3. W/N the hearing officer abused discretion in denying NASSCO's motion for postponement.
4. W/N the eye injury is compensable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Regional Offices have the authority to hear claims. Section 25 of Reorganization Plan 20-A merely reallocated powers already possessed by the Department of Labor, which is in conformity with the authority granted by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 997, as amended by Republic Act No. 1241 [2].
2. **YES.** Section 3 of the Workmen's Compensation Act expressly makes the law applicable to "employees and laborers employed... in the industrial concerns of the government," such as NASSCO [3]. The fact that the physician does not perform manual labor does not exempt him from coverage [3]. Furthermore, the salary limitation of P4,800 per annum applies only to "public employment" under Section 39(e) (employment in the service of the National Government and its political subdivisions), and not to employment in industrial concerns under Section 3, which has no such limitation [4, 6].
3. **NO.** The denial was justified. NASSCO had already managed to secure four postponements, and the last was granted with the condition that no further postponement would be allowed [6]. Being a government-controlled corporation does not entitle NASSCO to delay trial indefinitely to suit its convenience [6].
4. **YES.** Substantial evidence, including testimony from eye specialists, showed that the ailment could have been caused by abrupt changes in atmospheric pressure during the flight [5]. Even if the claimant's hypertension was a contributing factor, the aggravation of a pre-existing disease caused by working conditions is compensable [5]. Due to the statutory presumption of compensability, the burden is on the employer to prove the injury was not work-related, which NASSCO failed to discharge [5].

**Decision affirmed.**
