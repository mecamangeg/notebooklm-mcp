I. CAPTION
CARLOS KHAN and LUZ S. KHAN v. JACOBO ASUNCION, et al., G.R. No. L-23377, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 30, 1964, plaintiffs spouses Khan filed a suit against defendants spouses Asuncion to enforce an alleged oral joint venture agreement to develop defendants' land in Quezon City into a subdivision. Plaintiff Luz Khan alleged she had partially performed her obligations under the verbal contract by obtaining a loan, negotiating with prospective buyers, contracting an engineer, and paying for a project study [1-4]. Defendants filed an answer denying the existence of the agreement and raised the affirmative defense that the claim was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403 of the Civil Code) because it involved an interest in real property and was not in writing [5]. After a preliminary hearing on this affirmative defense, the trial court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that their partial execution of the contract removed it from the operation of the Statute of Frauds [6-8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint based on the Statute of Frauds was proper despite allegations of partial execution.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the order of dismissal. While Article 1403, par. (2)(e) of the Civil Code requires agreements for the sale of real property or an interest therein to be in writing, executed or partially executed agreements are excluded from the Statute of Frauds. This exclusion exists to prevent fraud, ensuring one party cannot keep benefits derived from partial execution while evading their obligations [8, 9].

Since the lower court dismissed the case after a preliminary hearing rather than a full trial, this amounted to a dismissal on a motion to dismiss. Under Section 3, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, if the ground for a motion to dismiss does not appear to be "indubitable," the determination should be deferred until trial [10, 11]. The Court found that it could not yet be ascertained from the records whether the defendants actually benefited from the plaintiffs' alleged acts of partial execution (such as the project study or negotiations) [10, 12-14]. Because the applicability of the Statute of Frauds depended on the factual question of whether beneficial partial execution occurred, the ground for dismissal was not indubitable. The case was remanded to the lower court for trial and further proceedings [11].
