I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Philippine Air Force) v. THE WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and NAZARIO BAUTISTA, G.R. No. L-22650, April 28, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On January 15, 1959, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) contracted independent contractor Carlos Pineda to construct toilet facilities at Nichols Air Base. Pineda recruited respondent Nazario Bautista as a mason for the project. On February 24, 1959, while inside the base, Bautista was struck by a PAF-owned tractor driven by a prisoner, resulting in leg fractures and permanent partial disability. As a gesture of sympathy, the PAF raised P900.00 through benefit shows and gave it to Bautista, who signed a deed releasing the PAF from all claims. Notwithstanding the quitclaim, Bautista filed a compensation claim. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) ruled in Bautista's favor. The PAF appealed, denying an employer-employee relationship and arguing the independent contractor was the employer.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Republic (PAF) is liable as the statutory employer of Bautista.
2. W/N the P900.00 voluntarily paid by the PAF should be deducted from the compensation award.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Republic is considered the statutory employer pursuant to Section 39(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. This provision includes as an "employer" the owner of an establishment or place of work who is "virtually the owner or manager of the business carried on" there, even if an independent contractor is involved. The Court held that while the PAF’s primary function is combat operations, the construction of facilities like toilets is necessary to keep personnel in healthful conditions and is "necessarily tied up with the exercise of its broad function" [1-3]. Additionally, the PAF failed to validly controvert the claim within the statutory period prescribed by Section 24 of the Act [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that equity demands the P900.00 be deducted from the P4,000.00 award. Since Bautista chose to rely on his strict legal rights by filing a claim despite signing a quitclaim, he is entitled only to the corresponding legal compensation and no more. Equity must relieve the PAF from an abuse of its generosity [5-7].

The decision of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the P900.00 previously paid be deducted from the award.
