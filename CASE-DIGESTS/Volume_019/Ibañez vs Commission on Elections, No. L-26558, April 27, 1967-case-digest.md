I. CAPTION
AMADO O. IBAÑEZ and ESTHER A. RAFAEL-IBAÑEZ v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-26558, April 27, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Amado and Esther Ibañez were appointed as "Election Registrars in the Commission on Elections" without designation of specific stations [1]. They were subsequently assigned to the Fourth District of Manila. Following the decision in *Puyat v. Commission on Elections*, which voided appointments of registrars-at-large, and the enactment of R.A. 4730 requiring registrars to be appointed to specific cities or municipalities, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) reorganized its personnel [2], [3].

Since Manila had only four authorized registrar positions but over fifty registrars assigned there, COMELEC screened the incumbents and appointed private respondents (Roa, Regalado, Verdejo, and Bautista) as the permanent Election Registrars for Manila [3], [4]. COMELEC directed petitioners to turn over their property and records to the new appointees. Petitioners refused, claiming they had acquired security of tenure in Manila. Consequently, COMELEC ordered their preventive suspension and initiated an administrative investigation for disobedience [5]. Petitioners filed a petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, Mandamus, and Quo Warranto to assert their right to the Manila positions [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners are entitled to security of tenure as Election Registrars of Manila.
2. W/N petitioners can question the title of the private respondents via *quo warranto*.
3. W/N the preventive suspension of petitioners violated due process.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Security of tenure depends on the nature of the appointment. Petitioners were appointed generally to the Commission, not to a specific station; they were merely *assigned* to Manila [7]. The Court distinguished *appointment* from *assignment*, holding that the rule against unconsented transfers applies only when an officer is appointed to a particular station (*Miclat v. Ganaden*; *Jaro v. Valencia*) [8]. In default of a particular station in the appointment, "no security of tenure can be asserted on the basis of the mere assignment given" [9]. Furthermore, if the initial appointments were void for lack of specific station under *Puyat*, petitioners would be mere *de facto* officers with no tenure rights [10].

2. **NO.** To maintain a *quo warranto* action, the petitioner must claim a clear right to the disputed office (*Cuyegkeng v. Cruz*) [11]. Petitioners merely asserted a right to be appointed, but the power to appoint is discretionary and belongs to the COMELEC (*Jimenez v. Francisco*) [12]. Additionally, since there were two petitioners and four respondents holding one class of office, it would be impossible to determine which respondent should be ousted if the petition were granted (*Nueno v. Angeles*) [13].

3. **NO.** The suspension was a "preservative measure" pending administrative investigation, not a penal sanction. Therefore, it could be imposed without prior notice or opportunity to be heard (*Cornejo v. Gabriel*) [14].

Petition dismissed [15].
