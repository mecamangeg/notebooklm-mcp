I. CAPTION
CECILIO MENDOZA v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS and LUISA DE LA ROSA MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-23102, April 24, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Luisa de la Rosa Mendoza filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 3436) for support against her husband, Cecilio Mendoza [1, 2]. She alleged that they were married on September 2, 1953, and lived together until July 14, 1954, when Cecilio went to the United States to study and work [2]. Luisa claimed Cecilio abandoned her without cause and refused to provide support despite her being pregnant and sickly [2, 3].

Cecilio filed a motion to dismiss arguing lack of jurisdiction, which was denied [3]. He then filed an answer putting in issue the validity of their marriage [3]. Subsequently, he filed a second motion to dismiss, invoking Article 222 of the Civil Code, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of action because it did not allege that earnest efforts toward a compromise had been made before filing the suit [4]. The Court of First Instance denied the motion [5]. Cecilio petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of prohibition, which was denied [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the complaint for support should be dismissed for failure to allege earnest efforts toward a compromise as required by Article 222 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's refusal to dismiss the complaint [6, 7].

While Article 222 of the Civil Code generally requires that earnest efforts toward a compromise be made and alleged in suits between family members, this requirement is expressly "subject to the limitations in article 2035" [4, 6]. Under Article 2035, no valid compromise can be made regarding "the validity of a marriage" or "future support" [8].

The Court held that since the complaint involved a claim for future support and the answer challenged the validity of the marriage, the issues were non-compromisable [6]. Therefore, a showing of previous efforts to compromise would be superfluous and Article 222 does not apply [8]. Although the claim might have included support in arrears (which is compromisable), the existence of a valid cause of action for future support prevented dismissal [8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed [7].
