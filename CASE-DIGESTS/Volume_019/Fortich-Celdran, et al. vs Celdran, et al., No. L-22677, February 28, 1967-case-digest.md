I. CAPTION
PEDRO III FORTICH-CELDRAN, et al. v. IGNACIO A. CELDRAN and HON. COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-22677, February 28, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In a civil suit for annulment of extrajudicial partition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu, the court upheld the validity of the partition, ruling that respondent Ignacio Celdran had ratified it by signing a "Motion to Withdraw" (Exhibit B-Josefa). Ignacio appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), alleging that his signature on said motion was forged.

While the civil appeal was pending, Ignacio filed a criminal complaint for falsification of a public document against petitioners (Pedro III Fortich-Celdran, et al.) in the CFI of Misamis Occidental, referring to the same "Motion to Withdraw." Ignacio subsequently moved to suspend the criminal proceedings, arguing that the authenticity of the document pending in the civil case constituted a prejudicial question. The CFI of Misamis Occidental denied the motion. On certiorari, the CA reversed the trial court and ordered the suspension of the criminal case. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the pending civil case regarding the authenticity of the "Motion to Withdraw" constitutes a prejudicial question that warrants the suspension of the criminal case for falsification.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA, ruling that a prejudicial question exists. A prejudicial question constitutes an issue in a civil case that is a logical antecedent to the issue in the criminal case, and its resolution is determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused [1], [2].

In this case, the authenticity of the "Motion to Withdraw" is squarely at issue in the pending civil appeal, as it determines whether Ignacio ratified the extrajudicial partition [3]. If the civil courts find the document to be genuine, the criminal charge for falsification cannot stand [1]. Since the resolution of the document's authenticity in the civil case is determinative of the criminal case, the criminal proceedings must be suspended until the civil case is decided [4].

The petition was denied, and the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the suspension of the criminal case was **AFFIRMED** [5].
