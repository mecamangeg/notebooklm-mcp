I. CAPTION
PABLO DE JESUS, ENGRACIA DE JESUS, and MANUELA DE JESUS v. HON. GREGORIO N. GARCIA, Judge of the City Court of Manila, Branch I; THE SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, LTD., MAXIMA DE JESUS, and SALVADOR BARRIOS, G.R. No. L-26816, February 28, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Maxima de Jesus (administratrix/co-owner) and other co-owners, including petitioners, owned parcels of land in Manila leased to respondent Shell Company. Maxima was entitled to a 10% administration fee from the rentals. In October 1966, petitioners instructed Shell to pay their share of the rentals directly to them to evade paying Maxima's fee. Maxima filed a complaint in the City Court of Manila (Civil Case No. 153460) against petitioners and Shell, praying for "final injunction" to compel Shell to continue the previous payment method (issuing a check in her name alone) and for petitioners to pay the 10% fee. The City Court Judge issued an *ex-parte* writ of preliminary injunction ordering Shell to pay Maxima alone. Petitioners moved to dismiss and dissolve the injunction on jurisdictional grounds, which the City Court denied. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.
2. W/N the City Court has the power to issue a writ of preliminary or final injunction in this case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The averments of the complaint determine jurisdiction. Maxima’s complaint sought to compel Shell to follow a specific mode of payment and her co-owners to recognize her administration fee. This constitutes an action for specific performance, which is a subject matter "not capable of pecuniary estimation." Under Section 44(a) of the Judiciary Act of 1948, such actions fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court). The fact that a specific amount (P185.08) was claimed is immaterial, as it was merely incidental to the primary relief of specific performance.

2. **NO.** The City Court (an inferior court) lacks jurisdiction to hear cases for "final injunction," which is expressly granted to the Court of First Instance under Section 44(h) of the Judiciary Act of 1948. Furthermore, inferior courts may only issue writs of preliminary injunction in cases involving forcible entry (Section 88, Judiciary Act of 1948). As this case did not involve forcible entry, the City Court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by issuing the writ.

The petition is GRANTED. The City Court is directed to dismiss Civil Case No. 153460.
