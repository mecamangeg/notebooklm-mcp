I. CAPTION
MUNICIPALITY OF SAN JOAQUIN v. NICANOR SIVA, BASILIO SAPITANAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19870, March 18, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On July 10, 1961, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 436, creating the municipality of Lawigan composed of twenty-one (21) barrios previously part of the Municipality of San Joaquin [1]. Petitioner Municipality of San Joaquin filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo against respondents Nicanor Siva and others, who were appointed by the President as mayor, vice-mayor, and councilors of Lawigan, to restrain them from performing their functions [1]. Petitioner argued that Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code, the basis for the Executive Order, constituted an undue delegation of legislative powers to the President and was unconstitutional [1]. The CFI dismissed the petition, upholding the legality of the Executive Order. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Executive Order No. 436 is void for relying on an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Executive Order No. 436 is void *ab initio*. The Supreme Court relied on the ruling in *Pelaez vs. Auditor General* (G.R. No. L-23825, December 24, 1965), which established that Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code constitutes an undue delegation of legislative powers to the President and is therefore unconstitutional [2, 3]. Consequently, the creation of the municipality of Lawigan under said void Executive Order is invalid. The decision of the lower court is reversed, Executive Order No. 436 is declared null and void, and respondents are directed to refrain from acting as officers of the municipality of Lawigan [3].
