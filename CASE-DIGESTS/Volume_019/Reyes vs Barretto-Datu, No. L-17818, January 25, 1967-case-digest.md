I. CAPTION
**TIRSO T. REYES, as guardian of the minors Azucena, Flordelis and Tirso, Jr., all surnamed Reyes y Barretto v. LUCIA MILAGROS BARRETTODATU**, G.R. No. L-17818, January 25, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Bibiano Barretto died leaving a will that instituted Salud Barretto and respondent Milagros Barretto as heirs, with a usufruct over a fishpond reserved for his widow, Maria Gerardo. Maria Gerardo, as administratrix and guardian of the then-minor Milagros, executed a project of partition which was approved by the probate court in 1939. Properties were distributed and titles issued accordingly.

After Maria Gerardo died in 1948, it was determined in a separate proceeding that Salud was not the biological daughter of Bibiano and Maria. Petitioner Reyes (Salud’s husband and guardian of her minor children) filed this action to recover Salud's one-half share of the fishpond. Milagros counterclaimed, arguing that the 1939 partition was void *ab initio* under Article 1081 of the Civil Code of 1889 because Salud was included as an heir despite not being a biological child of the testator. The trial court ruled in favor of Milagros, declaring the partition void and ordering the return of Salud’s share.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the partition is void *ab initio* under Article 1081 of the Civil Code of 1889 because one of the instituted heirs was found not to be the testator's biological child.
2. W/N the decree of distribution issued in 1939 can still be set aside.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Article 1081, which provides that a partition including a person believed to be an heir but who is not shall be void, is inapplicable. Salud was expressly instituted as an heir in Bibiano's will. The law speaks of "heirs," not "children" or "descendants." The testator was at liberty to assign the free portion of his estate to whomsoever he chose. The fact that Salud was not a biological daughter does not preclude her from being a testamentary heir. Furthermore, there was no preterition of Milagros, the forced heir, as she was not omitted from the will.

2. **NO.** A project of partition is merely a proposal; it is the court's final decree of distribution that vests title. The 1939 decree was a judgment *in rem* and became final. The validity of the project of partition becomes irrelevant once the decree is final. Moreover, any relief on the ground of fraud is barred by prescription. Milagros attained majority in 1944 and the four-year period to file an action expired in 1948, long before her counterclaim was filed.

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** and set aside insofar as it ordered the reconveyance of properties, and the case is remanded for the partition of the fishpond.
