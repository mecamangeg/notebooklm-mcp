**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. NICOLAS CUNANAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17599, April 24, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the night of May 16, 1957, Jose David was shot and killed while driving a jeep in Mexico, Pampanga. Several passengers, including Luciano Punzalan and the victim's brother Andres David, claimed to have seen the accused, Nicolas Cunanan, commit the crime or fleeing the scene. However, immediately after the shooting, none of these witnesses informed the authorities (police, mayor, or constabulary) that Cunanan was the culprit. The police blotter entry on the night of the incident recorded the assailant as "unknown." The witnesses only revealed Cunanan's identity days later, claiming they stayed silent due to fear of vengeance from the accused’s family. The Court of First Instance convicted Cunanan of murder based on these testimonies, while acquitting his co-accused, Clemente Manaloto. Cunanan appealed, relying on the defense of alibi that he was attending a religious service at the *Iglesia Ni Kristo* chapel at the time of the shooting.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt given the delay in his identification by prosecution witnesses.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the judgment and acquitted Cunanan. The Court held that the failure of prosecution witnesses to point to the accused as the culprit immediately after the shooting raised grave doubts as to their veracity [1]. The "natural reaction of one who witnesses a crime is to reveal it to the authorities," and their "stultified silence" for several days rendered their testimony unreliable [2]. Because the evidence of identification was not convincing, proof of motive became necessary, which the prosecution failed to establish [3, 4]. Furthermore, where identification is unreliable, the defense of alibi assumes importance and may be given credence (*People v. Rafallo*) [5]. The Court applied the principle *mas vale que queden sin castigar diez reos presuntos, que se castigue uno inocente* (it is better to let ten guilty men go unpunished than to punish one innocent man) [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
