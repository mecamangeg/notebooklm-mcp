**I. CAPTION**
INTESTATE ESTATE OF VICTOR SEVILLA. SIMEON SADAYA v. FRANCISCO SEVILLA, G.R. No. L-17845, April 27, 1967, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 28, 1949, Victor Sevilla, Oscar Varona, and petitioner Simeon Sadaya executed a joint and several promissory note for P15,000.00 in favor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). Varona received the entire proceeds, while Sevilla and Sadaya signed as accommodation makers [1]. On October 6, 1952, Sadaya paid the outstanding balance of P5,746.12 to the bank after Varona failed to pay [2]. Varona failed to reimburse Sadaya despite demands.

Upon Victor Sevilla's death, Sadaya filed a claim against his intestate estate for the amount paid [2]. The administrator, respondent Francisco Sevilla, resisted the claim. The trial court admitted Sadaya's claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, disallowing the claim because Sadaya paid voluntarily without judicial demand and failed to prove Varona's insolvency [3, 4]. Sadaya appealed, seeking 50% contribution from the estate [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N a solidary accommodation maker who paid the promissory note may demand contribution from a co-accommodation maker without first proceeding against the principal debtor.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. The Court ruled that while a solidary accommodation maker may seek reimbursement from the principal debtor (Varona), their right to seek contribution from a co-accommodation maker (Sevilla) is subject to specific conditions [6, 7].

Since the Negotiable Instruments Law does not define the right of reimbursement between co-accommodation makers, Article 2073 of the Civil Code applies, treating them as joint guarantors [8, 9]. Under Article 2073, a guarantor who pays may demand contribution from co-guarantors only if: (1) the payment was made by virtue of a judicial demand, or (2) the principal debtor is insolvent [9, 10].

Here, Sadaya paid the bank voluntarily without any judicial demand, and there was no proof that the principal debtor, Varona, was insolvent [4]. Consequently, Sadaya's right to demand contribution from Sevilla's estate had not yet arisen [4].

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [4].
