I. CAPTION
SAN PABLO OIL FACTORY, INC. v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and KAPATIRANG MANGGAGAWA ASSOCIATION (NLU), G.R. No. L-25044, February 28, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In a previous decision (G.R. No. L-18270), the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) finding that San Pablo Oil Factory, Inc. (Petitioner) conducted a discriminatory lockout against members of the Kapatirang Manggagawa Association (Respondent Union). The Court ordered the reinstatement of the workers with back wages [1]. During execution, the CIR Chief Examiner computed the back wages based on the 85 working days comprised within the lockout period (May 27 to September 8, 1957) [2]. Petitioner objected, arguing that the factory only actually operated and milled for 39 days during that period [2]. Despite the examiner confirming the 39-day operation, the CIR *en banc* adopted the 85-day basis for computation [2]. Petitioner appealed, contending the back wages should be limited to the days of actual operation [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the back wages should be computed based on the total working days of the lockout period rather than the days the factory actually operated.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the back wages must be limited to the thirty-nine (39) days the factory was actually in operation [3]. The Court reasoned that even if there had been no lockout, the laborers could not have possibly worked when the factory was not in actual operation [3]. Since the employees had no monthly salary and were paid a daily wage for services actually rendered, they could not have earned wages on days the factory did not mill [3].

The decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is MODIFIED and the award reduced accordingly [3, 4].
