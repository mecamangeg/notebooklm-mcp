I. CAPTION
MARTIN B. AUSTRIA, petitioner, vs. THE AUDITOR GENERAL, respondent., G.R. No. L-21918, January 24, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Martin B. Austria, the high school principal of Olongapo High School, faced an administrative complaint filed by four teachers. Following an investigation, the Director of Public Schools found him guilty. On July 13, 1955, Austria was suspended from service. The Commissioner of Civil Service subsequently found him guilty of improper conduct and abuse of authority, ordering his demotion to the rank of classroom teacher and transfer to another station. This decision was affirmed by the Civil Service Board of Appeals. On October 7, 1959, Austria was appointed to the lower position of classroom teacher in Davao. He filed a claim for back salaries for the period of his suspension (from July 1955 to October 1959), arguing that his subsequent appointment constituted "reinstatement" under Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code, which entitles a suspended employee to pay upon reinstatement. The Auditor General denied the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a government employee who is found guilty in an administrative case and appointed to a demoted position is entitled to back salaries during their suspension under Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the Auditor General's denial of the claim. The Court held that "reinstatement" under Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code refers to restoration to the service resulting from exoneration. It cannot be comprehensively understood to include demotional appointments issued pursuant to an adverse decision where the employee is found guilty. In this case, the petitioner was not exonerated; his appointment to a lower position was a penalty for his guilt. Consequently, the denial of salary during the suspension was proper because valid grounds for suspension existed. The Court further noted that the delay in his reappointment (exceeding the standard two-month suspension limit) was due to the practical difficulties of the government in finding a vacancy for a demoted officer. The petition was denied and the ruling of the Auditor General was affirmed.
