I. CAPTION
PLACIDO C. RAMOS and AUGUSTO L. RAMOS v. PEPSI-COLA BOTTLING CO. OF THE P.I. and ANDRES BONIFACIO, G.R. No. L-22533, February 9, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On May 10, 1958, a collision occurred between a car owned by Placido Ramos (driven by Augusto Ramos) and a tractor-truck owned by Pepsi-Cola (driven by Andres Bonifacio) [1]. Ramos filed a suit for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The CFI found Bonifacio negligent and held Pepsi-Cola solidarily liable, ruling that the company failed to prove it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family [2]. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed Bonifacio's negligence but absolved Pepsi-Cola from liability, finding that the company sufficiently proved due diligence in the selection of its driver [3, 4]. Ramos appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the credibility of Pepsi-Cola’s personnel manager, Juan T. Añasco, and the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the driver's selection [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Pepsi-Cola exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection of its driver.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. The Court held that the credibility of witnesses is a question of fact, and the CA's findings on such matters are binding on the Supreme Court [5, 6]. The uncontradicted testimony established that Pepsi-Cola carefully examined the driver's qualifications, experience, and record of service, including background checks, clearances, and physical, theoretical, and practical driving examinations [4]. Under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, as interpreted in *Campo v. Camarote* and *Bahia v. Litonjua*, proof of such careful examination demonstrates the diligence of a good father of a family and successfully rebuts the *juris tantum* presumption of employer negligence [4, 7, 8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9].
