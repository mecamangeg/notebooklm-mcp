I. CAPTION
NORTON & HARRISON CO. & JACKBILT CONCRETE BLOCKS CO. LABOR UNION (NLU) v. NORTON & HARRISON CO. & JACKBILT CONCRETE BLOCKS CO., INC. and ALBERTO GOLDEN, G.R. No. L-18461, February 10, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Jaime Arcaina, a mechanic and former union president of the petitioner Union, was dismissed by respondent Company on May 26, 1958. The dismissal stemmed from an incident on May 24, 1958, where Arcaina told the assistant superintendent he would work only until 5:00 PM instead of his scheduled 8:00 PM, and subsequently left early. The Company manager, Alberto Golden, dismissed him for leaving without permission and violating company rules. However, the dismissal was effected without the fair hearing required under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which mandated that dismissals be handled by a board of representatives.

Believing the dismissal was due to union activities, the Union filed a notice of strike alleging unfair labor practice (ULP) and went on strike on July 29, 1958. The Company hired replacements. Later, the Union offered to return to work, but the Company refused. The Union filed a complaint for ULP with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR Trial Judge ruled in favor of the Union, ordering reinstatement with backwages. However, the CIR *en banc* reversed this, finding Arcaina was dismissed for just cause (lack of permission), that there was no ULP, and that the strike was merely economic, meaning replaced strikers had no right to reinstatement. The Union appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the strike was legal despite the finding that the employer did not commit unfair labor practice.
2. W/N the strikers and the dismissed employee (Arcaina) are entitled to reinstatement and backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that while the employer was not guilty of unfair labor practice (ULP) because Arcaina indeed left without permission, the strike was still legal. The dismissal violated the CBA procedure by denying Arcaina a fair hearing. This swift action, without due process against a former union president, reasonably led the Union to believe in good faith that the dismissal was predicated on union activities. Citing *Ferrer v. CIR*, the Court ruled that a strike declared to offset what the union warranted in believing in good faith to be ULP is not illegal, and strikers do not lose their employee status.

2. **YES to Reinstatement; NO to Backwages.**
**On the Strikers:** Since the strike was legal and they retained their employee status, they are entitled to reinstatement. The workers hired to replace them are deemed to have accepted employment subject to the outcome of the labor dispute. However, because the Company was absolved of the ULP charge (as the dismissal was technically for just cause), the reinstatement is without backwages.
**On Arcaina:** While he left work without permission, his dismissal was procedurally illegal for lack of a fair hearing as required by the CBA. Therefore, he must be reinstated. However, he is not entitled to backwages; the period he was out of work serves as the penalty for his infraction of leaving without clear permission.

**DISPOSITION:** Resolution reversed. Respondents ordered to reinstate Jaime Arcaina and the strikers without backwages.
