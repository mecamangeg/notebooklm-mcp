I. CAPTION
ABELARDO BUENO v. FRANCISCO G. CORDOBA, JR., G.R. No. L-23932, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On March 21, 1963, an officer of the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) reported to the RCA General Manager that Abelardo Bueno, a warehouseman, had authorized the unloading of 20 bags of rice at a private house without proper papers [1, 2]. Based on this report, the RCA General Manager filed an administrative charge against Bueno for misconduct and violation of office rules [3]. Neither the subordinate's report nor the Manager's charge was under oath [4].

Bueno moved to dismiss the case before the investigator, respondent Francisco G. Cordoba, Jr., arguing that Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act) requires a sworn complaint for an investigation to proceed. The motion was denied [4]. Bueno then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte. The lower court ruled in Bueno's favor, restraining the investigation because there was no sworn complaint. The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an administrative proceeding commenced by an agency head requires a sworn complaint to be valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under Section 32 of Republic Act No. 2260 and Section 24 of Rule XVIII of the Civil Service Rules, administrative proceedings may be commenced in two ways: (1) upon a charge by the Department or Agency head; or (2) upon a complaint filed by any other person [5, 6].

The requirement that a complaint be "subscribed and sworn to" applies only to the second category (complaints filed by other persons). It does not apply to proceedings commenced by a direct charge from the Department or Agency head [6]. As the head of the office, the RCA General Manager is not required to swear to the charges he files because his position of responsibility sufficiently warrants that the charges are worth investigating, and he acts in the performance of a function he has already sworn to discharge faithfully upon assuming office [7, 8].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **REVERSED** and SET ASIDE, and the petition is DISMISSED [9].
