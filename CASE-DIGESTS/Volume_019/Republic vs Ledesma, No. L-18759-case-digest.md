I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL LEDESMA, G.R. No. L-18759, February 28, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines sued Manuel Ledesma in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to collect P16,212.00 in deficiency income tax for 1951 [1]. The deadline for the 1951 return was March 1, 1952 [2]. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) released the assessment on February 25, 1957 [2]. Ledesma requested a reinvestigation, but when the BIR required him to specify his grounds under oath and post a bond, he failed to comply or respond further [2], [3].

The Republic filed the collection suit on July 21, 1958 [4]. Ledesma argued that the action had prescribed, contending that under Section 51(d) of the Tax Code, the government only had 5 years from the return date to sue [5]. He also denied liability, claiming the income belonged to his son-in-law [1]. The CFI dismissed the case on the ground of prescription [1]. The Republic appealed directly to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judicial action to collect the deficiency income tax has prescribed.
2. W/N the taxpayer can dispute the correctness of the assessment in the ordinary civil action for collection.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. Section 51(d) of the Tax Code applies only to the summary remedy of distraint and levy, not to judicial actions [6], [7]. Judicial collection is governed by Sections 331 and 332 of the Tax Code [6]. Under Section 332(c), if a tax is assessed within the statutory period (5 years from the return deadline), the government has an additional 5 years from the date of assessment to file a court action [8], [9]. Since the assessment was made on February 25, 1957 (within 5 years of March 1, 1952) and the case was filed on July 21, 1958 (within 5 years of the assessment), the suit is timely [9].

2. **NO.** The taxpayer is barred from disputing the assessment in the collection suit. Ledesma failed to effectively dispute the assessment when he ignored the BIR’s requirements for reinvestigation [3]. Consequently, the assessment became final and executory [10]. The proper remedy for a disputed assessment is an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals; a taxpayer cannot question a final assessment in a civil action for its collection [10], [3].

The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the respondent is ordered to pay the deficiency tax plus surcharges and interests [11].
