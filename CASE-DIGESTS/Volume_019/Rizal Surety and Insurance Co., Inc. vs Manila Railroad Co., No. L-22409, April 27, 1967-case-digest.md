I. CAPTION
**RIZAL SURETY AND INSURANCE CO., INC. v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORTSERVICE**, G.R. No. L-22409, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Rizal Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. (plaintiff) sued as subrogee of Natividad Lim, the consignee of 250 cases of corned beef shipped on the S/S Boissevair, which arrived in Manila on January 9, 1961. On that same day, the consignee filed a "Provisional Claim" with the arrastre operators, Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service (defendants), advising that the shipment had been "shortlanded and/or landed in bad order" but noting the claim was for any loss "that may after examination be found to exist." The discharge of the cargo was only completed the following day, January 10, 1961, when it was discovered that 24 cases and 17 tins were missing [1]. Rizal Surety paid the consignee and filed suit for reimbursement. The City Court and the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Rizal Surety. The defendants appealed, arguing that the provisional claim was premature and did not comply with Section 15 of the Management Contract, which requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the discharge of the last package [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provisional claim filed before the discharge of the last package constitutes substantial compliance with the 15-day claim requirement of the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court ruled that the provisional claim was speculative and did not constitute substantial compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract. Citing *Shell Co. of the Phil., Ltd. v. Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas*, the Court held that a claim filed before the discharge of the last package is generally premature [4]. While the Court has previously held (in *Hampshire Fire Insurance Co.*) that a provisional claim filed before discharge may be valid if the consignee already has actual knowledge of the shortage, that exception does not apply here [5, 6]. The stipulation of facts and the wording of the provisional claim itself—stating it was for losses "to be later on discovered"—proved the consignee lacked definite information of the shortage when the claim was filed on January 9 [6, 7]. As the provisional claim was invalid and the formal claim filed on March 3, 1961 was beyond the 15-day period, the defendants are relieved of liability [7].
