I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. ANTONIO G. GUERRERO and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS (consolidated with ANTONIO G. GUERRERO v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE), G.R. Nos. L-19074 & L-19089, January 31, 1967, 19 SCRA 205, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Antonio G. Guerrero was a log dealer in 1949-1950 who sold logs to Aparri Lumber Company [1]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed him P5,139.17 for forest charges, fixed and percentage taxes, and compromise penalties [1], [2]. A warrant of distraint and levy was issued, prompting Guerrero to file a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [2].

The CTA ruled Guerrero was liable for P3,775.66 in forest charges because his auxiliary invoices were spurious, but absolved him of liability for: (1) P1,192.51 in fixed and percentage taxes (holding the Government, not the concessionaire, "sold" the logs); (2) P668.36 in additional charges on logs discovered during the case but not part of the original assessment; and (3) compromise penalties [3], [4], [5]. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Guerrero is liable for the forest charges and surcharges (P3,775.66).
2. W/N Guerrero is liable for fixed and percentage taxes as a producer/concessionaire (P1,192.51).
3. W/N the CTA has jurisdiction to award additional assessments discovered during pendency but not included in the contested assessment.
4. W/N Guerrero is liable for compromise penalties despite the lack of a formal agreement.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Forest charges are liens on forest products and are collectible from whomever is in possession, unless they show required official invoices (*Collector of Internal Revenue v. Pio Barretto Sons*). Guerrero claimed to be merely an agent, but his auxiliary invoices were spurious or referred to other logs, and he failed to prove payment or agency [7].

2. **YES.** The Court rejected the CTA's theory that the Government "sells" forest products to the cutter. Forest charges are payments for the privilege of exploiting the concession, not a sale of goods. Consequently, the "original sale" subject to tax under the Tax Code is made by the concessionaire (Guerrero) who cuts or removes the products [8], [9].

3. **NO.** The CTA is a court of purely appellate jurisdiction. It correctly declined to make an award on the additional logs (P668.36) because they were not included in the contested assessments and thus were not originally in issue [10].

4. **YES.** While compromise penalties usually require an agreement, Guerrero expressly stated his willingness to pay "any compromise penalty" imposed by the Court. Therefore, the penalties of P120.00 and P50.00 should be included in the judgment [11].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is MODIFIED. Guerrero is ordered to pay P3,775.66, P1,192.51 (fixed/percentage taxes), and P170.00 (compromise penalties) [11].
