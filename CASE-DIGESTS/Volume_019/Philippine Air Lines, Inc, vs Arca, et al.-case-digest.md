I. CAPTION
RAMOS, et al. v. PEPSI-COLA BOTTLING CO. OF THE P.I., et al., May 16, 1967, 19 SCRA 295, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ramos, et al. filed a motion for reconsideration after the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision absolving respondent Pepsi-Cola of liability for a collision involving its tractor-truck [1]. The truck, weighing 30,000 kg and measuring 3 meters wide, was driven by Pepsi-Cola's driver alone at approximately 30 kph [2, 3]. Petitioners alleged negligence based on violations of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3992), specifically claiming that the truck exceeded the 15 kph speed limit for trailers, lacked a required helper or rear-vision mirror, and exceeded the 2.5-meter width limit [2, 3]. The CA did not make factual findings regarding the lack of brakes, mirrors, or special permits [4-6]. Petitioners also urged the Court to apply the doctrine of *respondeat superior* [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Pepsi-Cola was negligent for violating the Revised Motor Vehicle Law regarding speed, equipment, and width.
2. W/N the employer’s liability should be determined based on the doctrine of *respondeat superior*.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found no proven violations. Regarding speed, the 15 kph limit applies only to trailers lacking effective brakes; since the CA did not find that the trailer lacked brakes, the applicable limit was 30 kph [4]. Regarding equipment, the law requires either a helper *or* a rear-vision mirror; although the driver was alone, there was no positive finding that the truck lacked a mirror, so no violation was established [3, 5]. Regarding width, while the truck exceeded 2.5 meters, the law allows for special permits [8]. Since the truck was duly registered, the presumption of regularity and compliance with law prevails, and petitioners failed to prove the specific lack of a permit [6, 9].

2. **NO.** The Court refused to abandon the *Bahia* ruling or apply *respondeat superior* [7]. Under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, an employer's liability is based on its own negligence in the selection and supervision of the employee, not the employee's negligence [10]. Responsibility ceases once the employer proves it observed the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage [7].

Motion for reconsideration denied [11].
