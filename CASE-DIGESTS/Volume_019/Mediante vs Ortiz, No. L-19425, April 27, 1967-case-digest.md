I. CAPTION
DEMOSTHENES MEDIANTE and PABLO PASENIO v. HON. MONTANO ORTIZ, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Agusan, G.R. No. L-19425, April 27, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
A criminal complaint for illegal possession of firearms was filed against Mamerto Campo in the Municipal Court of Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental, presided by petitioner Judge Mediante. The complaint alleged the offense was committed in Barrio Cadena de Amor, Magsaysay [1, 2]. A warrant of arrest was issued. Instead of challenging the jurisdiction in the Municipal Court, Campo filed a petition for "Prohibition, Injunction and Damages" in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan, presided by respondent Judge Ortiz [3]. Campo claimed the area where he was "harvesting" and "residing" (and where the warrant was served) was in Agusan, not Misamis Oriental [2]. Respondent Judge Ortiz denied petitioners' motions to dismiss and asserted jurisdiction over the matter [4, 5]. Petitioners filed this action to prohibit the respondent Judge from proceeding with the case against them [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI of Agusan has jurisdiction to enjoin or prohibit the Municipal Court of Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental from proceeding with a criminal case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the CFI of Agusan lacked jurisdiction. First, the specific allegation in the complaint that the crime was committed in Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental determines jurisdiction, and any question regarding this must be resolved in the first instance by the Municipal Court itself [2, 7]. Second, a petition for prohibition to restrain the Municipal Court of Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental should have been filed in the CFI of Misamis Oriental, which has appellate and supervisory jurisdiction over said municipal court, not in the CFI of Agusan [8, 9]. The respondent Judge's injunction was deemed "officious and unwarranted" and constituted an "undue arrogation" of supervisory power [9].

Petition granted [10].
