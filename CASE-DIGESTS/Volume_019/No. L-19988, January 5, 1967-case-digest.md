I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. PEDRO OLASE and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-19988, January 5, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Pedro Olase, a GSIS employee, was dismissed for alleged malfeasance but filed a petition for reinstatement in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [1]. The CIR ordered his reinstatement but denied back wages, finding the dismissal was done in good faith [2]. Both GSIS and Olase appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the CIR decision [3, 4]. Olase then moved for execution, claiming his reinstatement should be effective as of July 27, 1960—ten days after GSIS received the CIR's denial of the motion for reconsideration [4]. GSIS actually reinstated him on January 21, 1962, but refused to pay salaries for the interim period, arguing that Olase's own appeal prevented the decision from becoming executory pending the Supreme Court's final decision [4]. The CIR ruled in favor of Olase, ordering GSIS to pay his salary from July 27, 1960, to January 21, 1962 [5]. GSIS appealed this order to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR decision ordering reinstatement was executory pending appeal, entitling the employee to salaries from the expiration of the appeal period until actual reinstatement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR resolution [6]. Under **Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 103**, a decision of the CIR becomes effective and self-executory ten days after the award or decision, notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal, unless the Court specifically orders a stay of execution [7]. The mere institution of an appeal does not stay the execution of the award [7]. Consequently, the reinstatement order became executory on July 27, 1960, and Olase was entitled to his salary from that date until his actual reinstatement on January 21, 1962 [8]. The Court clarified that this payment is not "back wages" for the period of dismissal (which were denied), but rather salaries earned during the period when the reinstatement order should have been enforced but was not [6, 8].
