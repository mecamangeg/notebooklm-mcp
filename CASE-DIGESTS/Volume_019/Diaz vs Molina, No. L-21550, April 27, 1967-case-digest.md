I. CAPTION
ALFREDO DIAZ v. LUIS MOLINA, NARCISO MADERIA and THE HONORABLE JOSE M. SANTOS, G.R. No. L-21550, April 27, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellant Alfredo Diaz was the landholder of ricelands in Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, while respondents-appellees Luis Molina and Narciso Maderia were his tenants under a share tenancy system (50-50 sharing). Sometime before March 20, 1961, the tenants notified Diaz of their desire to change their tenancy relationship to leasehold effective the agricultural year 1961-1962. Diaz refused to accede to this change. Consequently, the tenants filed petitions with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to approve the change and fix rentals. Diaz insisted on the share tenancy and subsequently filed petitions for consignation of transplanting expenses and for the ejectment of tenant Molina for alleged pre-threshing and negligence.

The CAR decided in favor of the tenants, declaring the relationship to be leasehold effective 1961-1962, fixing the rentals, and dismissing Diaz's petitions for consignation and ejectment. Diaz appealed to the Supreme Court via petition for certiorari, solely questioning the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Law), which allows tenants to unilaterally change the tenancy system.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, authorizing tenants to change the tenancy contract from share to leasehold, is constitutional.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199. Citing *Primero v. Court of Agrarian Relations* [1] and *De Ramas v. Court of Agrarian Relations* [1], the Court ruled that the statute is a valid remedial legislation promulgated pursuant to the social justice precepts of the Constitution and in the exercise of the police power of the State to promote the common weal.

The Court held that the provision does not impair the obligation of contracts. The right granted to the tenant to change the system is not unreasonable or oppressive; while the landlord's share may decrease (from 30% to 25%), the tenant becomes more responsible and competent, ultimately benefiting the landlord and "giving full meaning to the social justice directive contained in the Constitution" [2].

The decision appealed from is AFFIRMED.
