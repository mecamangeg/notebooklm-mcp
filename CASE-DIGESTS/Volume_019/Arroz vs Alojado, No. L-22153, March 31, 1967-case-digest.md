I. CAPTION
ALFREDO ARROZ v. JOAQUINA A. ALOJADO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22153, March 31, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On November 10, 1961, defendant Joaquina A. Alojado executed an agreement acknowledging receipt of P1,500.00 from plaintiff Alfredo Arroz. Alojado used a portion of her residential lot as collateral, stipulating that if she failed to return the amount by November 30, 1961, the land would be considered sold to Arroz, subject to a 15-day redemption period [1, 2]. Alojado failed to redeem the property by December 15, 1961. Arroz demanded the execution of a Deed of Conveyance, but Alojado refused and instead deposited P1,530.00 with the Municipal Treasurer of Brooke's Point [3, 4].

Arroz filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Palawan praying for: (1) the immediate conveyance of the land; (2) the declaration of the deposit as void; and (3) damages of P1,000.00 [4, 5]. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court (now Municipal Court) because the amount involved did not exceed the jurisdictional limit [6]. Arroz appealed, arguing the case involved specific performance [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the action to compel the execution of a deed of conveyance and declare a deposit ineffectual.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the subject matter of the litigation is **not capable of pecuniary estimation** and therefore falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [7, 8].

The Court explained that the complaint did not seek the payment of the loan, but rather the specific performance of the obligation to convey the land and the determination of the validity of the deposit [9]. Under **Section 88 of the Judiciary Act**, while Municipal Courts have jurisdiction over cases where the demand does not exceed a certain amount, this jurisdiction "shall not extend to civil actions in which the subject of litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation" [8, 10]. Citing *Manufacturers' Distributors, Inc. v. Yu Siu Liong*, the Court reiterated that where the primary relief sought is specific performance, the action is beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, even if damages are also prayed for as a consequence [10].

The Order of dismissal was **SET ASIDE** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [11].
