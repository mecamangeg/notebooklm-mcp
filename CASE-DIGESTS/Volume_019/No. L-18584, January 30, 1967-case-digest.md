I. CAPTION
LO CHI and FELIX TINDUGAN v. HONORATO J. DE LEON, DOROTEO L. SERRANO, THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY and TERESITA TUD TORRENTE, G.R. No. L-18584, January 30, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Teresita Tud Torrente filed a compensation claim for her husband's death against petitioners Lo Chi and Felix Tindugan with the Department of Labor Regional Office in Naga City [1, 2]. The Hearing Officer, Doroteo L. Serrano, rendered a decision ordering petitioners to pay P4,200 [2]. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal with the Labor Standards Commission [2]. Respondent Torrente moved for execution, arguing the appeal was improper [2]. Respondent Regional Administrator Honorato J. De Leon issued a writ of execution [2]. Petitioners filed a petition for *certiorari* with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (Quezon City) to restrain the execution [2]. The CFI dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction over officials outside its territory [2, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the decision of the Hearing Officer became final and executory despite the appeal to the Labor Standards Commission.
2. W/N the Regional Administrator had the authority to issue the writ of execution.
3. W/N the CFI of Rizal had jurisdiction to issue writs against officials in Naga City.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The appeal was ineffective because it was filed with the Labor Standards Commission, which has no appellate jurisdiction over workmen's compensation claims [4, 5]. Under Rule 23 of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) Rules, appeals must be lodged with the WCC [5]. The perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is jurisdictional; thus, the failure to appeal to the correct body rendered the Hearing Officer's decision final and executory [5].

2. **NO.** At the time the writ was issued in 1960, Regional Administrators did not have the power to enforce awards [6]. Prior to Republic Act No. 4119 (effective 1964), the power to enforce WCC awards was judicial and vested in the courts [6, 7]. Consequently, the specific writ of execution issued by respondent De Leon was null and void [8]. However, the award itself remains valid and final [9].

3. **NO.** A Court of First Instance lacks jurisdiction to issue writs of injunction, *certiorari*, and prohibition against officers or persons outside its territorial jurisdiction [10, 11]. Since the acts sought to be restrained were being committed by officials in Naga City, the CFI of Rizal (Quezon City) had no jurisdiction over them [11].

The Order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED**, and the records are remanded to the Regional Office in Naga City for proper execution of the award [12].
