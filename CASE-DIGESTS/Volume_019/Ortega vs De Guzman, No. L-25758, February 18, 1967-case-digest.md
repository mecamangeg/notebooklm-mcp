I. CAPTION
JOAQUIN ORTEGA v. EULOGIO F. DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-25758, February 18, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Joaquin Ortega filed an election protest against Respondent Eulogio F. De Guzman contesting the results of the November 12, 1963 gubernatorial election in La Union [1]. On September 8, 1964, the trial court granted Ortega's motion to examine contested ballots with his expert, Col. Bugarin [2]. However, for over ten months (December 1, 1964 to October 13, 1965), the protest remained dormant [3]. The expert had stopped his examination in October 1964 to work on another case for Senate President Marcos, but Ortega failed to replace him or inform the court of this delay [4], [5].

On October 13, 1965, De Guzman moved to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute and because Ortega had filed a certificate of candidacy for Congressman in the upcoming 1965 elections [2]. Ortega's counsel failed to file a written opposition to the motion despite being granted time to do so [2], [3]. The Court of First Instance of La Union dismissed the protest for abandonment and failure to prosecute [2]. Ortega appealed, arguing the delay was justified [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in dismissing the election protest for failure to prosecute.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The dismissal of an action due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time rests on the sound discretion of the court, considering the specific facts of the case (*Smith, Bell & Co. v. American President Lines, Ltd.*; *Flores v. Philippine Alien Property Administrator*) [7], [6].

The Supreme Court held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion. Ortega failed to prosecute the case for over ten months and failed to replace his unavailable expert or notify the court [5], [3]. Furthermore, Ortega's candidacy for Congressman and his subsequent filing of protests regarding that separate race demonstrated a lack of interest in the gubernatorial protest, effectively relegating it to the background [8], [9]. The Court emphasized that election contests must be concluded as speedily as possible to dissipate doubt regarding the electorate's will and maintain public faith in the government (*Arnedo v. Court of Appeals*) [10].

The order appealed from is affirmed [11].
