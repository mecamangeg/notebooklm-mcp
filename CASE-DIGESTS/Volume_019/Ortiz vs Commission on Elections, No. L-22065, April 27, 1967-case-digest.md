I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO ORTIZ v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, PRIMITIVO R. PASTA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22065, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Francisco Ortiz sought to annul the October 17, 1963 resolution of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) [1]. The COMELEC had denied his petition to declare invalid the certificates of candidacy of the other respondents (Primitivo R. Pasta, et al.) for the 1963 elections [1]. Ortiz argued that the respondents failed to comply with Section 32 of the Revised Election Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 3522, because their certificates did not contain a waiver of the privilege regarding public disclosure of their income tax returns and tax census statements for 1961 and 1962 [1]. Instead of invalidating the certificates, the COMELEC advised the respondents to file amended certificates including the waiver, even after the filing deadline had passed [1].

On February 10, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a resolution noting that if the respondents (except the COMELEC) failed to be elected in the 1963 elections, the case would be academic [1, 2]. The Court required Ortiz to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed [2]. On March 14, 1967, Ortiz filed a manifestation and motion praying for the dismissal of his petition [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found the petitioner's motion for dismissal to be in order following the Court's previous resolution suggesting the case may be academic due to the conclusion of the 1963 elections [2, 3]. Consequently, the motion to dismiss the petition was granted without costs [3].
