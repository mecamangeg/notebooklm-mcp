I. CAPTION
IMUS ELECTRIC CO., INC. v. HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-22421, March 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On June 23, 1930, the Municipal Council of Imus, Cavite, granted Imus Electric Co., Inc. (Petitioner) a franchise to operate an electric plant under Act No. 667. The franchise imposed a tax of 1% of gross receipts for the first 20 years and 2% for the next 15 years [1]. However, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Petitioner for a deficiency franchise tax at the rate of 5% plus a 25% surcharge for the period from January 1, 1956, to September 30, 1960, pursuant to Section 259 of the National Internal Revenue Code (Tax Code) as amended by Republic Act No. 39 [2].

Petitioner challenged the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that its franchise was a private contract protected by the non-impairment clause and that the general provision of the Tax Code did not repeal the specific tax rates in its franchise [3]. The CTA affirmed the CIR's decision, ruling that the franchise contained an express reservation that it was subject to amendment or repeal by Congress [4]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 259 of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. 39, repealed the specific tax rates provided in Petitioner's municipal franchise.
2. W/N Petitioner is liable for the 25% surcharge on the deficiency tax.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The municipal franchise granted under Act No. 667 is expressly subject to the power of Congress to alter, modify, or repeal the same [5, 6]. Section 259 of the Tax Code, which imposes a 5% franchise tax, constitutes an exercise of this reserved power to amend [7]. The Court, citing *Lealda Electric Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* and *Balanga Power Plant Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, held that Section 259 became the basic tax law applicable to all existing and future franchises [8]. Since the application of Section 259 is an exercise of a power expressly reserved in the franchise itself, it is not a violation of the franchise or an impairment of rights [9].

2. **NO.** An electric company is not liable for the 25% surcharge when its failure to pay the full tax was due to an honest belief that it was subject to the lesser rate fixed in its franchise, rather than the 5% rate in the Tax Code [7, 10]. Citing *Connell Bros. Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, the Court ruled that the surcharge may be dispensed with when the delay is in good faith due to a misunderstanding of the applicable regulations [11].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the 25% surcharge is eliminated [12].
