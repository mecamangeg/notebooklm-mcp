I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CATALINO SANTOS, et al., G.R. No. L-17217 (with L-17215 and L-17216), February 28, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On March 12, 1958, Flaviano Fontanilla and his two sons, Raymundo and Victorino, were ambushed and killed by a group of Ilongots while walking along Sagat Creek in Aglipay, Nueva Vizcaya. The assailants shot the victims from foxholes and subsequently beheaded and hacked their bodies. Artemio Simanero, who was with the victims, survived by hiding behind boulders and later reported the incident. He identified the attackers as Catalino Santos (the leader), Pablo Basilio, Tabbegat Bocto, Singgup Olmehemet, and Obdiy-ya Antolin.

The motive was a land dispute; the Fontanillas were cultivating land claimed by the Ilongots. During the investigation, the accused executed extrajudicial confessions before the Justice of the Peace and pleaded guilty at the preliminary hearing. Rifles and personal belongings of the accused were recovered at the scene or through their information. Antolin was discharged as a state witness. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya convicted the accused of multiple murder (L-17217) and illegal possession of firearms (L-17215/16). Santos was sentenced to death for the murders, while the others received life imprisonment or indeterminate sentences. The accused appealed, challenging the credibility of witnesses and claiming their confessions were obtained under duress.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused are guilty of multiple murder based on the evidence presented.
2. W/N the death penalty was correctly imposed on appellant Catalino Santos.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the findings of guilt. The survivor, Simanero, positively identified the appellants, a testimony corroborated by the state witness Antolin and the physical evidence (firearms and personal effects found at the scene). The Court rejected the defense of duress regarding the confessions, noting they were subscribed before the Justice of the Peace who verified their voluntariness. Furthermore, the confessions contained specific details that could have been supplied only by the appellants themselves. The recantation of the state witness Antolin was deemed unreliable compared to his earlier testimony which led to the recovery of the murder weapons.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court reduced the penalty for Catalino Santos from death to three (3) *reclusion perpetuas*. Although the crime was qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation, inhabited place, and band, the necessary votes for the death penalty were lacking. The Court considered the circumstance that Santos, an uneducated Ilongot, acted to forestall what he believed was a usurpation of his tribe's rights and an abuse of authority by the victim (a former mayor). Consequently, he was not dealt with the same severity as persons otherwise circumstanced, and his sentence was modified to life imprisonment subject to the 40-year limit under Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code.

The judgment was **MODIFIED** as to the penalty of Santos and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.
