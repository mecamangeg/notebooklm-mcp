I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GERMAN GASTON, VICTORIA VDA. DE GASTON v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20320, March 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On February 1, 1962, the Republic of the Philippines filed a money claim against the Estate of German Gaston for crop loans obtained by the deceased from the Bank of Taiwan between April and December 1943 [1]. The loans were evidenced by five promissory notes secured by a chattel mortgage on standing crops for the 1943-1944 agricultural year [1, 2]. The notes did not specify a maturity date. The Administratrix opposed the claim, arguing it was barred by the Statute of Limitations having been filed 14 years after issuance [3]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the claim, ruling that the notes were payable on demand and prescription ran immediately from their execution [2, 4]. The Republic appealed, contending that the Moratorium Law suspended the prescriptive period [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the money claim filed by the Republic is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's order.
First, the Court rejected the lower court's finding that the instruments were demand notes. Since they evidenced crop loans for the 1943-1944 agricultural year, they became due and demandable only at the end of that crop year (approximately April 1944), provided the mortgagor complied with the chattel mortgage conditions [2, 5].
Second, the Court applied the Moratorium Law. The prescriptive period was suspended from November 18, 1944 (issuance of E.O. No. 25) until May 18, 1953 (promulgation of *Rutter v. Esteban*), a period of 8 years and 6 months [6].
Counting from the accrual of the cause of action in April 1944 to the filing of the claim in February 1962, approximately 17 years and 10 months had passed. After deducting the moratorium period, only about 9 years and 4 months had elapsed, which is within the 10-year prescriptive period [7].

The Order was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Reyes, J.B.L., Regala, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro, JJ., concurred) [8].
