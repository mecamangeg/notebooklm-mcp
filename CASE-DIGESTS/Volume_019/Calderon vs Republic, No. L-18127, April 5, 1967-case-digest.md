I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF GERTRUDES JOSEFINA DEL PRADO, THRU HER NATURAL GUARDIAN CORAZON ADOLFO CALDERON v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-18127, April 5, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Gertrudes Josefina del Prado, a minor born in 1956, is the illegitimate child (natural child by legal fiction) of Manuel del Prado and Corazon Adolfo, born of a bigamous marriage that was subsequently annulled [1, 2]. She resides with her mother and stepfather, Romeo C. Calderon, who supports her [2]. Through her mother, Gertrudes filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Davao to change her surname from "Del Prado" to "Calderon" to remove the stigma of illegitimacy and improve her social standing [1, 3]. Her stepfather consented to the use of his surname [2]. The Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing that under the Civil Code, a natural child by legal fiction must principally use the father's surname, and that the change would conceal her status and prejudice her rights [4, 5]. The trial court granted the petition, finding it to be in the best interest of the child [6]. The Solicitor General appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a natural child by legal fiction may be allowed to change her surname from that of her natural father to that of her stepfather.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order. Under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court, a change of name is a matter of judicial discretion and may be granted for "proper and reasonable cause" [2, 7]. The Court held that the petition should be granted because it is clearly for the best interest of the child [3]. Changing her surname to that of her stepfather, with whom she lives and who supports her, promotes her personality and eliminates the stigma of illegitimacy [3].

Addressing the Solicitor General's argument regarding the Civil Code provision (Article 867) that a natural child by legal fiction "shall principally enjoy the surname of the father," the Court ruled that this does not prohibit the child from adopting another surname with consent and for justifiable reasons [7]. If a legitimate child may secure a change of name for proper cause, an illegitimate child should not be denied the same opportunity [7]. Furthermore, citing *Yu v. Republic*, the Court emphasized that a change of name does not alter family relations, rights, duties, or civil status; it only alters the label by which a person is known [8, 9]. The Order appealed from is affirmed [10].
