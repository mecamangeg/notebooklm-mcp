I. CAPTION
TOMAS ALARCON v. RUFINA GUERRERO VDA. DE TORRES and J.M. TUASON & CO., INC., G.R. No. L-21656, March 31, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Tomas Alarcon filed Civil Case No. Q-5046 for specific performance against defendants Rufina Guerrero Vda. de Torres and J.M. Tuason & Co., Inc. Alarcon alleged that Torres' predecessor sold him a 1,000-square-meter lot in 1949 and that, pursuant to a 1953 Compromise Agreement between the "Deudors" (including Torres) and J.M. Tuason, the latter was obligated to enter into a new contract of sale with him [1-3]. J.M. Tuason moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of *lis pendens*, citing the existence of Civil Case No. Q-3277, a pending action for recovery of possession and ownership J.M. Tuason had filed against Alarcon in 1958 regarding the same lot [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed Alarcon's complaint based on *lis pendens* [1]. Alarcon appealed, arguing there was no *lis pendens* between the two cases [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Alarcon's complaint should be dismissed on the ground of *lis pendens*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that all requisites for *lis pendens* were present: (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for; and (3) identity such that the judgment in the pending case would amount to *res judicata* in the other [6].

The Court found that both Civil Case No. Q-3277 and the present case (Q-5046) involved the same parties and the same parcel of land [7]. In the pending case (Q-3277), J.M. Tuason claimed ownership via a Torrens title, while Alarcon claimed ownership through a Deed of Sale from Torres. In the present case, Alarcon sought to enforce rights under the Compromise Agreement, which were anchored on that same Deed of Sale [7, 8]. Thus, a finding as to the true ownership of the land was necessary in both cases, and the judgment in Q-3277 would necessarily constitute *res judicata* in Q-5046 [9]. The Court cited *Manuel v. Wigett* and *Del Rosario v. Jacinto* in affirming the dismissal [6, 9].

Order affirmed [10].
