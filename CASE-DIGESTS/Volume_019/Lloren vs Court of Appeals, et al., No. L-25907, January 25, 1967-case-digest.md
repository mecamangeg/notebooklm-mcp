I. CAPTION
ISABELO LLOREN v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25907, January 25, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections for mayor of Inopacan, Leyte, Isabelo Lloren and Pacito Abrea were candidates. The Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Lloren the winner with 1,449 votes against Abrea’s 1,440. Abrea filed a protest in the Court of First Instance of Leyte, which nullified certain votes and declared Abrea the winner. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision but affirmed Abrea’s victory by a plurality of 19 votes, declaring many of Lloren's ballots as marked. Lloren filed a petition for review by *certiorari* with the Supreme Court, challenging the CA's invalidation of specific ballots based on markings and illegibility [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the disputed ballots cast for the petitioner should be invalidated as marked ballots.

IV. RULING
**PARTIALLY YES AND PARTIALLY NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the invalidation of most ballots but reinstated a few.

**1. Valid Votes (*Idem Sonans* and Innocent Marks):**
The Court ruled that the disenfranchisement of electors is not favored and doubt must be resolved in favor of legality [4].
*   **Idem Sonans:** Votes reading "Sabilo yran" and "Eisabi" (where the voter attempted to write "Eisabilo") are valid. Under the rule of *idem sonans* and considering the voters were poor writers, the intent to vote for Isabelo Lloren was apparent [5].
*   **Nicknames:** The word "lowlow" written with a candidate's name was held valid as a nickname or appellation of affection, absent evidence *aliunde* of an intent to mark [6].
*   **Desistance:** A ballot with five big circles in the Senatorial lines was valid, as it merely indicated the voter's desistance to vote for other candidates [7].

**2. Invalid/Marked Ballots:**
*   **Irrelevant Expressions:** The Court invalidated ballots containing irrelevant words such as "engat" (written differently or inverted), "pansay" (toilet), "seniorito," "shot," "Have a good time Mr. Pacito," and "Forget me not." These were not nicknames or accidental markings but were clear indications of an intent to identify the ballots [8-11].
*   **Patterns:** The Court sustained the rejection of sets of ballots in specific precincts where words like "boy," "Menong," "sorab," or initials "AAD" appeared uniformly in the same spaces. Such "curious patterns" in multiple ballots within the same precinct constitute clear and convincing proof of a design to identify the voters [12, 13].

Consequently, while the Court credited Lloren with 4 additional valid votes, respondent Pacito Abrea still maintained a winning margin of 15 votes. The decision of the Court of Appeals was affirmed as modified, and the petition was dismissed [14].
