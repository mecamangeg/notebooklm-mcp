I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE AIR LINES, INC., petitioner, vs. HON. FRANCISCO ARCA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch I, and ARTURO T. SANTOS, respondents., G.R. No. L-22729, February 9, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Philippine Air Lines (PAL) obtained a judgment against respondent Arturo T. Santos in the Municipal Court [1]. Santos failed to perfect an appeal after his motion for reconsideration was denied. PAL obtained a writ of execution on May 20, 1963 [1]. On July 19, 1963, Santos filed a petition for relief from judgment in the Court of First Instance (CFI), presided by respondent Judge Arca, alleging excusable negligence [1]. Santos claimed his counsel's clerk, Leonardo Magat, received the order denying the motion for reconsideration, placed it in a desk, and then failed to hand it to the lawyer because the clerk fell ill with influenza from April 20 to May 4, 1963 [1].

Judge Arca initially dismissed the petition for relief on January 30, 1964, upon PAL's motion citing the flimsy excuse and late filing [2]. After Santos' first motion for reconsideration was denied, he filed a second motion for reconsideration supported by medical affidavits [2]. Judge Arca then reconsidered, setting aside the dismissal order [2]. PAL filed a petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in setting aside the dismissal of the petition for relief based on the clerk's alleged negligence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court found that the uncritical acceptance of the excuse offered by Santos constituted a whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to grave abuse of discretion [3, 4]. The Court characterized the excuse—that a clerk forgot to hand a court notice to counsel—as the "most hackneyed and habitual subterfuge employed by litigants who fail to observe procedural requirements" [3, 4]. The Court reiterated established jurisprudence (*Gaerlan v. Bernal*; *Mercado v. Judge Domingo*) that such excuses are neither credible nor constitutive of excusable negligence [5].

Furthermore, even assuming the clerk's illness was genuine, he returned to duty on May 4, 1963, while the appeal period did not expire until May 13, 1963 [5]. Counsel's failure to make inquiries or check the clerk's desk during this interval betrayed a lack of diligent supervision and attention that cannot be accepted as excusable neglect [5].

Petition granted. The Court of First Instance of Manila is directed to dismiss the petition for relief [6].
