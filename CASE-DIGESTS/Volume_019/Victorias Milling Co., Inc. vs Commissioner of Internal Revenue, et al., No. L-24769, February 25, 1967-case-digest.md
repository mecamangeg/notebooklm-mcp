I. CAPTION
VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. Nos. L-24769 & L-24779, February 25, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Victorias Milling Co., Inc. imported sugar bags and materials from September 7, 1959, to August 26, 1960, which were used as containers for the sugar it manufactured and sold [1]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed advance sales tax on these imports. Victorias Milling contested this, and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of the company, declaring the bags exempt from advance sales tax and ordering a refund of P158,269.61 [1]. However, the CTA did not award interest on the refund. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court: the CIR argued the bags were subject to tax under Sections 183(b) and 190 of the Tax Code [2], while Victorias Milling argued it was entitled to interest on the refund due to the CIR's alleged arbitrariness [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the imported sugar bags and containers are subject to advance sales tax.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to interest on the tax refund.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The sugar bags are not subject to advance sales tax. The Court relied on its ruling in *Victorias Milling Co. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (G.R. No. L-21171), noting that Section 188(d) of the Tax Code expressly exempts articles subject to tax under Section 189 [2]. Since Victorias Milling already paid the 2% tax imposed by Section 189 on the gross value of the sugar (based on market value/selling price), this payment necessarily included the value of the containers [5]. There was no evidence that the bags were charged or sold separately from the sugar; thus, they fall under the exemption. Alternatively, if the bags were not included in the sugar's price, they were effectively not "sold" by the company, rendering them non-taxable [2, 6].

2. **NO.** The petitioner is not entitled to interest on the refund. The Court held that arbitrariness—defined as an "inexcusable or obstinate disregard of legal provisions"—is required to warrant the payment of interest on tax refunds [3]. In this case, the Commissioner's initial ruling imposing the tax was "to some extent supported by the letter of the pertinent law," and therefore did not constitute arbitrariness [4].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [7].
