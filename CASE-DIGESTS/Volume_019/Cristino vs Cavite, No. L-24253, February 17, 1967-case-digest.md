I. CAPTION
BRIGIDO CRISTINO v. LEON CAVITE, G.R. No. L-24253, February 17, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 1963 local elections in Hindang, Leyte, Brigido Cristino (Protestant) and Leon Cavite (Protestee) were candidates for councilor [1]. There were three candidates with the surname "Cristino": Brigido (a re-electionist known as "Ding"), his brother Bernardo (known as "Doc" or "Dr."), and their cousin Zosimo [2]. The controversy centered on 154 ballots containing the name "D. Cristino" [1]. Brigido claimed these votes, arguing "D" stood for his nickname "Ding" [3]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte rejected this claim, ruling that "D" could also refer to Bernardo's nickname "Doc" or "Do," making the votes ambiguous [3]. The lower court declared the 154 ballots as stray votes and dismissed the protest [1], [4]. Brigido appealed directly to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the ballots containing "D. Cristino" should be counted in favor of Brigido Cristino under the equity-of-the-incumbent rule.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision to declare the 154 ballots as stray votes. The Court ruled that while the voter's intention must be given effect, it cannot be determined by mere speculation [6]. The Court rejected the application of Rule 16, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code (as amended by R.A. 3036), which provides that if candidates have the same surname and one is an incumbent, a vote containing *only* the surname is counted for the re-electionist [7]. In this case, the voters did not write "Cristino" alone but added the initial "D" [8]. Since "D" could reasonably refer to either Brigido ("Ding") or Bernardo ("Doc"), and the lower court found the evidence of intention inconclusive, the votes could not be credited to the petitioner [9], [8].

The judgment of the lower court was affirmed [10].
