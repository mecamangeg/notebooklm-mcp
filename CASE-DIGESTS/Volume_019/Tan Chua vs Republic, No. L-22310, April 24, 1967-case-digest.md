I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. TAN CHUA alias CARLOS CUA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22310, April 24, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On December 4, 1959, Tan Chua filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. The court granted the petition on October 15, 1960, finding he possessed all qualifications [1]. On September 19, 1962, Tan Chua filed a motion to take his oath [2]. The Solicitor General opposed the motion, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because Tan Chua failed to state his previous addresses in the petition in violation of Section 7 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 473, and that he used the alias "Carlos Cua" without judicial authority [2].

On October 29, 1963, the CFI denied the petition and the motion to take the oath, citing the grounds raised by the Solicitor General as well as Tan Chua's errors in English and Tagalog and his operation of a travel agency without authority [2, 3]. Tan Chua appealed, arguing the court *a quo* erred in denying the petition after it had already been granted [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Government is estopped from questioning the petitioner's qualifications after the petition for naturalization has been granted.
2. W/N the failure to state all former places of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
3. W/N the unauthorized use of an alias disqualifies the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Government is not estopped. At the hearing on a motion to take the oath, the court may inquire into "any question affecting the qualifications of the applicant." Unlike final decisions in other court proceedings, a decision granting citizenship does not become executory. Naturalization is not a judicial adversary proceeding, and the decision therein is not *res judicata* as to any matter supporting the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization [3].

2. **YES.** Tan Chua failed to state his former residences in Manila (Ilaya, Sto. Cristo, Clavel, Soler, etc.) in his petition, listing only his last address [4]. This violation of Section 7 of C.A. No. 473 is a fatal defect warranting dismissal. The omission amounts to falsifying the truth, indicating a lack of good moral character. The fact that he stated these addresses during hearings for clearances does not cure the defect [4, 5].

3. **YES.** The petitioner used the alias "Carlos Cua" without judicial authority, violating C.A. No. 142 [6]. Using an alias without authority indicates that the petitioner has not conducted himself properly and lacks the good moral character required to acquire Philippine citizenship [6].

**The Order appealed from is AFFIRMED.**
