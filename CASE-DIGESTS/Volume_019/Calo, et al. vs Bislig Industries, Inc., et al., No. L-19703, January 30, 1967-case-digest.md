I. CAPTION
CONSUELO V. CALO, MARCOS M. CALO and FLAVIO MAKINANO v. BISLIG INDUSTRIES, INC. and JUDGE LUIS REYES, G.R. No. L-19703, January 30, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Bislig Industries, Inc. (Bislig) filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 48455) against petitioners Consuelo V. Calo, et al., seeking ₱40,000.00 in damages. Bislig alleged that petitioners encroached upon its forest concession in Agusan and conducted illegal logging operations on approximately 42 hectares [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue, arguing that the issue involved the right to possess or cut logs, making it a real action that should be filed in Agusan where the timber concessions are located [2]. The respondent Judge denied the motion to dismiss. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition to set aside the lower court's orders [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for damages filed in Manila is a real action which should have been filed in Agusan.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the suit is a **personal action**, and thus venue was properly laid in Manila where the plaintiff corporation has its main office.

The Court reasoned that the main complaint is for the recovery of damages resulting from the petitioners' alleged illegal logging operations. These damages arose from the violation of Bislig's right to cut, collect, and remove timber under its license agreement [4]. Citing *Hodges v. Treasurer of the Philippines* (50 Phil. 16), the Court reiterated that an action for indemnity or damages, even if related to real estate, is a personal action if it does not directly seek recovery of the property itself but rather compensation for lost rights or preferences [5, 6]. Under Section 1, Rule 5 of the Old Rules of Court (now Section 2[b], Rule 4), personal actions may be commenced where the plaintiff resides [4].

Petition dismissed; writ of injunction dissolved.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
