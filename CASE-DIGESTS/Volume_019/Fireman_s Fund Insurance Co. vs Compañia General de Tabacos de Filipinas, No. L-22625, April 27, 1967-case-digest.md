I. CAPTION
FIREMAN’S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. COMPAÑIA GENERAL DE TABACOS DE FILIPINAS, MANILA PORT SERVICE, and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22625, April 27, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1962, International General Electric Co. shipped 15 cartons of cargo from New York to Manila on board the "Susan Maersk." The shipment was insured by Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company. Upon arrival in Manila on June 17, 1962, the carrier’s agent, Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacos), allegedly delivered the cargo to the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company) [1, 2]. However, the delivery to the consignee was short of one carton and another carton was missing contents, with a total loss value of P1,898.66. The consignee filed claims with the carrier, arrastre, and insurer. Tabacos rejected the claim, asserting it discharged the shipment complete, while the Manila Port Service denied receiving the missing carton [2].

Fireman’s Fund paid the claim and, as subrogee, filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against both Tabacos and the Manila Port Service/Manila Railroad Company as alternative defendants, citing uncertainty as to who was liable for the loss [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint against the Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that the amount demanded (P1,898.66) was below its jurisdictional limit, although it ruled on the claim against Tabacos [3]. Fireman's Fund appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the arrastre operator for a claim below its jurisdictional amount when joined as an alternative defendant with a maritime carrier.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal. Under **Section 5, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court**, a plaintiff may join causes of action in the alternative. The rule explicitly states that if any of the causes joined falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, the action shall be filed in said court [5, 6].

The Court held that since the action against the carrier (Tabacos) involves a contract of carriage by sea (admiralty), it falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFI regardless of the amount involved [7]. Consequently, the CFI also acquires jurisdiction over the alternative cause of action against the arrastre operator (Manila Port Service), even if the amount sought is below the jurisdictional limit. Citing **Switzerland General Insurance Co. v. Java Pacific** and **International Harvester v. Aragon**, the Court emphasized that where a cause of action is indivisible—covering both maritime and ordinary laws—jurisdictional limitations regarding amount must yield to the greater jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter for reasons of expediency and to avoid multiplicity of suits [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the CFI is directed to proceed with the case against the Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company [10].
