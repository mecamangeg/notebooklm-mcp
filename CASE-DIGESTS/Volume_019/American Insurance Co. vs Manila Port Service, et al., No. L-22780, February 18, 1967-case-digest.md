I. CAPTION
THE AMERICAN INSURANCE CO. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22780, February 18, 1967, 19 SCRA 383, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On December 21, 1960, the carrier S/S "Pioneer Myth" discharged 146 pails of ceramic colors into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (MPS). On the same day, a provisional claim was filed with MPS for the consignee, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. [1]. MPS eventually delivered only 141 pails, 18 of which were damaged. On February 8, 1961, the consignee filed a formal claim. MPS took no action until January 12, 1962, when it denied the claim arguing prescription because no suit was filed within one year of discharge [2].

American Insurance Co., as subrogee of the consignee, filed a complaint against MPS and Manila Railroad Company on October 26, 1962, in the City Court of Manila. The City Court ruled in favor of American Insurance. On appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) initially absolved the defendants but amended its decision to affirm the City Court's judgment, ordering payment of P1,196.47 [3, 4]. MPS appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law regarding the timeliness of the claim and suit [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the provisional claim filed on the date of discharge satisfied the 15-day claim requirement of the Management Contract.
2. W/N the suit filed on October 26, 1962, was barred by prescription for being filed more than one year after the discharge of goods.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A provisional claim seasonably filed is sufficient compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract, which requires filing a claim within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package [4]. The Court cited *State Bonding & Insurance Co. v. Manila Port Service* and *Yu Kimteng Construction Corp. v. Manila Railroad Co.* to support that a provisional claim filed within the period preserves the consignee's rights [4].

2. **YES.** (Note: The Court ruled the suit was *timely*, so the answer to "W/N the suit was barred" is NO, but phrased as "W/N the suit was filed within the prescriptive period," the answer is YES. Based on the reasoning, the suit was allowed).
**YES, the suit was timely.** Under Section 15 of the Arrastre Management Contract, a consignee has the option to sue within one year of discharge *or* wait for the arrastre operator's resolution and sue within one year of a rejection [5]. When the operator fails to act on a claim within one year from discharge, the claim is deemed rejected upon the expiration of that one-year period (here, December 21, 1961) [6]. The plaintiff then has one year from that constructive rejection to file suit. Since the claim was deemed rejected on December 21, 1961, and the suit was filed on October 26, 1962, it was well within the prescriptive period [6]. The Court affirmed the decision ordering the defendants to pay P1,196.47 with interest [7].
