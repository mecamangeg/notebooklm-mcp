I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF GAN TSITUNG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. GAN TSI-TUNG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20819, February 21, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gan Tsitung was issued a certificate of naturalization on December 24, 1954. Years later, the lower court ordered the cancellation of his certificate, which the Supreme Court initially affirmed in a decision dated November 29, 1965. The cancellation was based on the doctrine laid down in *Ong Son Cui v. Republic* (promulgated May 29, 1957), which declared that the publication of the notice of hearing in the Official Gazette for less than three consecutive issues is a jurisdictional defect rendering the proceedings void. In Gan Tsitung's case, the notice was published only once in the Official Gazette based on a directive by the Clerk of Court. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the *Ong Son Cui* doctrine should not be applied retroactively to his case, as he had relied on previous jurisprudence (*Delgado v. Republic* and *Barretto v. Republic*) which held that one publication constituted substantial compliance with the law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the doctrine in *Ong Son Cui* requiring three publications in the Official Gazette applies retroactively to cancel a certificate of naturalization issued prior to the promulgation of said doctrine.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration. While the Court maintained the rule in *Ong Son Cui* that failure to publish the notice of hearing three times is a jurisdictional defect, it held that this doctrine applies only to certificates of naturalization issued *after* May 29, 1957. The Court reasoned that prior to this date, the prevailing jurisprudence (*Delgado* and *Barretto*) allowed for one publication as substantial compliance. The status of a naturalized citizen attaches upon the issuance of the certificate and taking of the oath. Public policy demands that acts performed in justified reliance on the jurisprudence effective at the time—which forms part of the law of the land—should not be nullified by a subsequent change in interpretation. Since Gan Tsitung's certificate was issued on December 24, 1954, before the *Ong Son Cui* decision, it remains valid. The order cancelling the certificate was reversed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Dizon, J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that the *Delgado* doctrine was the "law of the land" until 1957. The petitioner had a right to assume the Clerk of Court was performing his duty regularly under the then-existing interpretation of the law.

**Castro, J. (Concurring and Dissenting):** Agreed with the principle of non-retroactivity but argued that the cut-off date should not be the date of the *Ong Son Cui* promulgation, but the date the decision became final. He believed protection should extend to those whose petitions were granted by lower courts before the *Ong Son Cui* ruling became final, even if they took their oath afterward.
