I. CAPTION
MARITIME COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, MARINE OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, and GENERAL MARITIME STEVEDORES' UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. ANSBERTO P. PAREDES and PHILIPPINE MARITIME INDUSTRIAL UNION, G.R. No. L-24811, March 3, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On March 17, 1965, the crew of the "Doña Aurora," members of respondent Philippine Maritime Industrial Union (PMIU), struck while the vessel was in Kobe, Japan. The President certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). On May 24, 1965, petitioner Maritime Company of the Philippines (MCP) and PMIU executed a "Memorandum Agreement" whereby the vessel would return to Manila and strikers would continue serving, leaving issues of wages and strike legality to the CIR.

PMIU subsequently filed motions alleging MCP violated the Agreement by failing to pay salaries and attempting to disembark crew members. MCP, joined by intervenors (MOAP and GMSU), moved to suspend hearings on these motions, arguing the CIR must first resolve the issue of the legality of the strike. On July 19, 1965, respondent Judge Paredes denied MCP's motion, ruling that the enforcement of the Agreement regarding wages and rights should be heard first to avoid hardship to labor. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration on July 23, 1965, but filed this Petition for Certiorari on July 31, 1965, without waiting for the resolution of their motion, alleging a lack of quorum in the CIR.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for certiorari is premature.
2. W/N the respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in prioritizing the hearing of the Agreement enforcement over the issue of the legality of the strike.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petition is premature. A writ of certiorari lies only when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (Section 1, Rule 65). A pending motion for reconsideration is an adequate remedy; thus, the writ should be denied if such motion is unresolved [1]. The petitioners' claim that a lack of quorum rendered the remedy inadequate was refuted by the Clerk of Court's certification that a quorum existed [2].

2. **NO.** The CIR has discretion in procedural matters under Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 and may prioritize motions to settle disputes affecting industrial peace [3]. The Judge's decision to prioritize issues regarding wages and the "Memorandum Agreement" was not capricious or whimsical but based on the need to prevent undue hardship to labor [4]. The Court distinguished this case from *Philippine Can Co. v. CIR*, noting that the present case involved public interest, the strikers had returned to work under a specific agreement, and the employer did not allege financial incapacity [5]. An error of judgment or procedure not amounting to grave abuse of discretion is not reviewable by certiorari [6].

Petition dismissed.
