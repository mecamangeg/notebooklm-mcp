I. CAPTION
VICENTE MENDOZA, ET AL. v. TIBURCIO DUAVE, G.R. No. L-21336, February 18, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On May 22, 1958, plaintiffs Mendoza filed a complaint for forcible entry against defendant Duave in the Justice of the Peace Court of Palauig, Zambales, alleging Duave deprived them of possession of their land. The lower court ruled in favor of plaintiffs. Duave appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Zambales but was declared in default for failing to file an answer. On November 18, 1959, the CFI rendered judgment ordering Duave to vacate the premises and pay attorney's fees.

Upon Duave's motion, the CFI set aside the default judgment and allowed him to answer. However, the case suffered multiple delays and postponements. On the hearing scheduled for November 28, 1962, Duave's counsel requested another postponement to "secure certain documents." The CFI denied the motion, considered the case submitted, and reinstated its November 18, 1959 decision. Duave appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the denial of postponement was arbitrary and the reinstatement of the default judgment was improper since the default order had been lifted.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for postponement.
2. W/N the trial court validly reinstated its previous judgment despite the lifting of the default order.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Postponements of trial are addressed to the sound discretion of the court and should not be interfered with unless abused (Sarreal v. Tan). Under Rule 22, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, a motion for postponement must be supported by an affidavit showing the materiality of the evidence and due diligence in securing it, which Duave failed to provide [1]. Furthermore, Duave's counsel had over two months to prepare between his appearance and the hearing date [2]. The Court emphasized that forcible entry proceedings are summary in nature and lawyers must refrain from dilatory tactics [3].

2. **YES.** The argument that the court could not reinstate the November 18, 1959 decision because the default order was previously lifted is a "mere technicality" [3]. Since the defendant failed to present evidence due to his unjustified absence, the result would have been the same even if the court had drafted a new decision. Reinstating the former decision avoided further unnecessary delays in the disposition of the case [3].

The orders of the lower court are AFFIRMED with treble costs against the defendant [4].
