I. CAPTION
ALFREDO K. TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22077, February 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo K. Tan, a Chinese citizen allegedly born in Butuan City, filed a petition for naturalization on January 3, 1962. He claimed to be employed as a salesman with a monthly salary of P300.00 and an annual bonus. To support his petition regarding his moral character, he presented two witnesses: Jose Mondejar, a foreman at the lumber company where petitioner worked, and Restituto Sintos, a school director. The Court of First Instance of Agusan granted the petition. The Republic appealed, challenging the credibility of the character witnesses, the petitioner's failure to state all former places of residence (specifically his 7-year stay in Manila for studies), the sufficiency of proof regarding his birth, and the lucrative nature of his income [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the character witnesses presented were credible within the contemplation of the Naturalization Law.
2. W/N the failure to state a former place of residence in the petition is a fatal defect.
3. W/N the petitioner proved possession of a lucrative income.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The character witnesses were not credible because they could not vouch for the petitioner's conduct during his entire period of residence. The Court found a "sizeable gap" in the evidence because the petitioner studied in Manila for seven years, while the witnesses remained in Butuan; thus, they could not observe his moral character during that period [3]. Furthermore, discrepancies between witness Sintos' affidavit (claiming to know petitioner since birth) and court testimony (claiming acquaintance since 1946) rendered them untrustworthy [4]. The Court cited *Cu v. Republic* regarding the requirement for credible witnesses [4].

2. **YES.** The petition was invalid for failing to disclose that the petitioner resided in Manila before transferring to Butuan. This omission is a violation of Section 7 of the Naturalization Law, which requires the statement of all places of residence [5]. The Court relied on *Keng Giok v. Republic* [5].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's monthly income of P300.00, even with an annual bonus of P1,000.00, does not satisfy the requirement of lucrative income. The Court reiterated that bonuses are not stable earnings and should not be included in the computation [6]. Furthermore, a tax assessment presented to prove ownership of a house was rejected as proof of title, citing *Province of Camarines Sur v. Director of Lands* [6].

ACCORDINGLY, the judgment is reversed and the petition is denied [7].
