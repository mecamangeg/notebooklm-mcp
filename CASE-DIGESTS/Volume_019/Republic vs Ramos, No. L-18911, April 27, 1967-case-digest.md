I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CLEOFE RAMOS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18911, April 27, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
The Republic of the Philippines filed a complaint against defendants Cleofe Ramos et al. seeking the annulment of the registration of Lot No. 2 of Plan Psu-117285 and the reversion of said lot to the public domain [1]. The Republic also sought to prohibit defendants from making illegal excavations and constructions on the Wawang Dapdap River [1].

Defendants filed an answer denying the illegal acts, alleging instead that third-party defendants Felipe Asuncion et al. were the ones responsible for the illegal constructions which reduced the river's width and caused it to bend toward defendants’ property [2, 3]. Consequently, defendants filed a third-party complaint against Asuncion et al., praying that the latter be ordered to remove their dikes and stakes [4]. The lower court granted Asuncion's motion to dismiss the third-party complaint, ruling that Asuncion had no relation to the plaintiff's claim and that the third-party complaint was an attempt to consolidate unrelated issues [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the third-party complaint filed by defendants against Asuncion et al. is proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under Rule 6, Sec. 12 of the Rules of Court, a third-party complaint is allowed for contribution, indemnity, subrogation, or other relief "in respect of his opponent’s claim" to minimize the number of lawsuits [6, 7]. However, this rule cannot be used as an excuse to indiscriminately file any claim a defendant may have against a third party which is unrelated to the main action [8].

The Republic sued defendants for specific acts of illegal excavation and to recover specific land [9]. If defendants are held liable, it would be due to their own acts, not those of the third-party defendants [10]. The claim against Asuncion for his alleged illegal works is a separate matter unrelated to the subject matter of the Republic's complaint against Ramos [11, 12]. Matters that should be threshed out separately cannot be joined to the original action by means of a third-party complaint [13].

The order of the lower court sustaining the motion to dismiss is affirmed [14].
