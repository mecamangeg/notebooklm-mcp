I. CAPTION
DOMINGO T. JACINTO v. HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, ALPHA INVESTMENTS AND FINANCE CORPORATION and PASTOR D. AGO, G.R. No. L-23098, February 28, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Alpha Investments and Finance Corporation filed a suit for recovery of a sum of money against Pastor D. Ago and petitioner Domingo T. Jacinto (as guarantor). Ago answered the complaint, but Jacinto failed to answer and was declared in default. Subsequently, a "Stipulation of Facts and Compromise Agreement" was executed and signed by the plaintiff, Ago, and Atty. Jose M. Luison as "counsel for defendants." Jacinto did not sign the agreement. The trial court approved the compromise and rendered judgment based thereon.

When the defendants failed to pay, Alpha Investments secured an *alias* writ of execution and levied on Jacinto’s properties. Jacinto moved to quash the writ, arguing that the judgment was not binding on him as he was not a party to the compromise, did not authorize his co-defendant or Atty. Luison to represent him, and no evidence was adduced against him despite his default. Respondent Judge Montesa denied the motion. After the Court of Appeals dismissed Jacinto's petition for lack of jurisdiction, he filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the judgment based on the compromise agreement is valid and binding on Jacinto.
2. W/N certiorari is the proper remedy to annul the writ of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that a client is not bound by a compromise agreement he did not sign and for which he gave no special authority. Under **Section 23, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court**, attorneys cannot compromise their client's litigation without **special authority**. The record showed Jacinto did not sign the agreement, and there was no proof Atty. Luison or Ago had special authority to bind him. Since Jacinto was in default and the plaintiff presented no evidence against him to prove the cause of action, the judgment based solely on the unauthorized compromise is null and void *ab initio* (citing *Zafra de Alviar v. CFI of La Union*).

2. **YES.** While certiorari generally does not lie where an appeal or petition for relief from judgment is available, the rule is relaxed when a writ of execution is already in the process of being carried out, rendering other remedies inadequate. Furthermore, a void judgment may be impugned and its execution restrained in any proceeding.

The petition is GRANTED. The orders issuing the writs of execution are declared null and void insofar as they affect petitioner Jacinto.
