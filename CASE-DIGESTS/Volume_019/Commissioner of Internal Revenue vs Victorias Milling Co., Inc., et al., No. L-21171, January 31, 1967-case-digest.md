I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. VICTORIAS MILLING CO., INC. and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-21171, January 31, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J. [1]

II. FACTS
Victorias Milling Co., Inc. (Victorias), a domestic corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of sugar, imported ready-made cloth sugar bags and materials for sugar containers from April to July 1959 [2]. Victorias requested the release of these goods without payment of compensating or advance sales tax, arguing that as a sugar central, it pays the percentage tax imposed by Section 189 of the Tax Code, and the bags were for exclusive use as containers for its sugar, not for resale [3]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) denied the request, ruling the imports were subject to advance sales tax [4]. Victorias paid the tax under protest and filed a claim for refund [4, 5]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Victorias, ordering the refund of P66,949.79, finding that the bags were not for sale to others and their value was included in the price of sugar subject to the percentage tax [6, 7]. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court for review [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N imported sugar bags used as containers for sugar are subject to advance sales tax. [10]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals. The Court held that the imported sugar bags are not subject to advance sales tax because Section 188(d) of the Tax Code explicitly exempts "articles subject to tax under section one hundred eighty-nine of this Code" from sales tax [11]. Section 189 imposes a 2% percentage tax on the "actual selling price or market value" of sugar manufactured by sugar centrals [11].

The Court rejected the CIR's argument that the containers should be taxed separately. It reasoned that the buyer pays one price for both the sugar and the container [12]. If the price of the container is included in the selling price of the sugar, it is already subjected to the 2% tax under Section 189, and taxing it again would be double taxation [12]. If the price is for the sugar alone, the container is deemed given *gratis*, meaning there is no sale to subject to tax [13].

Judgment affirmed. [13]
