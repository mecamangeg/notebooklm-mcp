I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition for Admission to Philippine Citizenship, Law Tai alias Vicente Lo v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-20623, April 27, 1967, 19 SCRA 896, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Law Tai, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization on January 14, 1961, in the Court of First Instance of Romblon [1]. He was born in China in 1923 and arrived in Manila in 1930 [2]. Throughout his stay, he resided in Laoag (less than 2 years), Manila, Bacolod (4-5 years), and finally Romblon [2]. He did not file a declaration of intention, claiming exemption under the law for having resided continuously in the Philippines for over 30 years [3]. However, records showed he left the country three times: a trip to Amoy in 1932 (less than 4 months), a trip to Amoy in 1948 (duration unknown), and a trip to Hong Kong (duration unknown) [2, 4]. Additionally, his petition failed to list his former residences in Laoag and Bacolod [5]. He reported an annual income of P5,499.58 to support a wife and six children [4]. The trial court granted the petition, and the Republic appealed [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention despite his travels abroad.
2. W/N the failure to state former places of residence in the petition is fatal.
3. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or profession.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner is not exempt. Under Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, exemption requires 30 years of continuous residence. The Court held that "residence" contemplates "actual and substantial" residence, not merely legal residence [3]. While the 1932 trip was short, the petitioner failed to prove the duration of his 1948 trip to Amoy and his trip to Hong Kong [6]. It was incumbent upon him to demonstrate that these absences were compatible with continuous residence; failing to do so, he cannot claim the exemption [7]. Without the mandatory declaration of intention, the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction to entertain the petition [7].

2. **YES.** The failure to state former places of residence is fatal to the petition [5]. The petitioner admitted residing in Laoag for less than two years and in Bacolod for four or five years, yet he listed only Romblon as his residence in his application [5]. Jurisprudence has stabilized the rule that such omission warrants the denial of the petition [5].

3. **NO.** The petitioner's income is not lucrative. An annual income of P5,499.58 is insufficient to support a wife and six children, particularly considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of money at the time [8].

The judgment is reversed, and the petition for naturalization is dismissed [9].
