I. CAPTION
YU KIMTENG CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-17027, March 3, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yu Kimteng Construction Corporation was the consignee of eight (8) lifts of reinforced steel bars. The carrying vessel arrived in Manila on May 28, 1957, and the shipment was completely discharged into the custody of respondents Manila Railroad Company and Manila Port Service (MPS) on May 31, 1957. On June 16, 1957, MPS billed the petitioner for arrastre charges on the *entire* shipment, indicating the goods were still intact. However, on June 20, 1957, MPS issued a gate pass and delivered only three (3) lifts. That same day, petitioner filed a provisional claim for the five (5) missing lifts.

The Supreme Court previously rendered a decision in favor of the petitioner. Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that: (1) the claim was barred by Section 15 of the Management Contract, which requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the vessel; and (2) their liability should be limited to P500 per package under the same contract.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the claim was timely filed despite being beyond the 15-day period from the discharge of the cargo.
2. W/N the respondents' liability is limited to P500 per package.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the claim was timely. While the general rule counts the 15-day period from the discharge of the last package, this rule does not strictly apply where the consignee learns of the loss only after the lapse of said period. Since MPS billed the petitioner for the full shipment on June 16, 1957 (16 days after discharge), the loss must have occurred after that date. Consequently, the 15-day period is computed from the date the consignee learned or could have learned of the loss. The claim filed on June 20, the day of partial delivery and discovery of loss, was well within the period [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the respondents cannot invoke the P500 limited liability clause for the first time on appeal. The respondents failed to plead this defense in their answer to the complaint, relying solely on the defense of the 15-day filing period. Furthermore, evidence regarding the actual value of the missing cargo was admitted during the trial without objection based on the liability limit [4], [5].

The Motion for Reconsideration is **DENIED**.
