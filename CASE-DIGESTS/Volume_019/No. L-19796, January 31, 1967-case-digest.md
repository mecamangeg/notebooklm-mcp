I. CAPTION
FILEMON LAVIÑA v. HON. FORTUNATO DE LEON, Executive Secretary, Office of the President, et al., G.R. No. L-19796, January 31, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Filemon Laviña was appointed Executive Officer of the Surplus Property Commission (SPC) on December 11, 1946. On June 5, 1947, he was suspended due to criminal charges regarding surplus property disposal. While he was suspended, President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 275 on October 1, 1949, abolishing the SPC and transferring its functions to the Surplus Property Liquidating Committee (SPLC). Subsequently, on December 1, 1950, Executive Order No. 377 abolished the SPLC and transferred its functions to the Board of Liquidators.

Laviña was acquitted of the criminal charges on May 20, 1955. He requested reinstatement and back salaries from the Board of Liquidators. The Office of the President approved payment of his salaries only from his suspension (June 5, 1947) until the abolition of the SPC (September 30, 1949). Laviña filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Rizal to compel his reinstatement and payment of salaries beyond October 1, 1949. The trial court denied the petition, ruling that his position was abolished by E.O. No. 275. Laviña appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Laviña is entitled to reinstatement and back salaries beyond the date the Surplus Property Commission was abolished.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that Executive Order No. 275 expressly and effectively abolished the Surplus Property Commission [1]. Unlike the order creating the Commission, which provided for the transfer of personnel from its predecessor, E.O. No. 275 contained no such provision for transferring personnel to the SPLC [2]. The SPLC was a distinct entity organized to liquidate assets within the shortest possible time. The abolition of the office was real and intended, as evidenced by the contemporaneous circulars terminating the services of SPC employees. Since the office of Executive Officer of the SPC was eliminated upon the Commission's abolition, Laviña cannot be reinstated to it, nor can he claim salaries after its dissolution. He is entitled to back pay only from the date of his suspension until the date of abolition [3, 4].

The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
