I. CAPTION
GLICERIO TINIO and TEODORA LIMBAN v. RODRIGO MACAPAGAL, et al., G.R. No. L-21012, February 25, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Rodrigo Macapagal and ten others were tenants of petitioners Glicerio Tinio and Teodora Limban [1, 2]. The respondents filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) seeking to change their tenancy contract with the petitioners from a share tenancy system to a leasehold system, invoking Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, as amended [2]. The CAR granted the respondents' petition, upholding their right to elect the leasehold system [2]. The petitioners sought a review by certiorari, challenging the validity of the statutory provision allowing such a change [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Section 14 of Republic Act No. 1199, granting tenants the unilateral right to change the tenancy contract from share to leasehold, is constitutional [4].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations [3, 5]. The Court ruled that Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Law (R.A. No. 1199), as amended, is constitutional [4]. It held that the provision granting the tenant the unilateral right to change the tenancy contract from share to leasehold system is a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power of the State designed to solve an existing socio-economic problem [4, 6]. The Court relied on settled jurisprudence, citing cases such as *Ilusorio v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, *Cuizon v. Court of Agrarian Relations*, and *Gamboa v. Pallarca*, which had previously upheld the validity of the contested provision [7].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from was affirmed with costs against the petitioners [5].
