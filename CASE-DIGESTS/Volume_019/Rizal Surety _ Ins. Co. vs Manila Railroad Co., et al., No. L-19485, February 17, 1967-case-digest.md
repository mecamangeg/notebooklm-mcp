**I. CAPTION**
RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO. v. MANILA RAILROAD CO. and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-19485, February 17, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 10, 1959, a shipment of 454 cases of corned beef consigned to Natividad U. Lim arrived in Manila and was discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Co.), on December 17, 1959. The management contract between the Bureau of Customs and the arrastre operator stipulated that claims for loss or damage must be filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the vessel.

Lim received the delivery permit from the Bureau of Customs only on January 18, 1960, and the gate pass on January 20, 1960. The goods were delivered to her broker on January 20, 1960, revealing a shortage of 96 cases. Lim filed a formal claim for the missing goods on January 21, 1960. Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. paid Lim for the loss and, as subrogee, filed suit against the arrastre operator. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Rizal Surety. The defendants appealed, arguing the claim was barred because it was filed beyond the 15-day period stipulated in the management contract.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the claim is barred by the failure to file it within the 15-day period stipulated in the management contract.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that literal compliance with the 15-day stipulation would be "illogical and oppressive" under the circumstances [1, 2]. The consignee could not have filed a claim within 15 days of the December 17 discharge because she only received the delivery permit on January 18 and the gate pass on January 20—dates well beyond the 15-day period [3]. The Court noted that the consignee had filed a provisional claim as early as December 13 (before discharge was complete) and filed the specific claim on January 21, immediately after receiving the partial delivery [1, 2]. The consignee did all that she could be expected to do, and requiring strict compliance when she had no knowledge of the loss would be unjustified [2].

**Judgment affirmed.**
