I. CAPTION
LUA KIAN v. MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY and MANILA PORT SERVICE, G.R. No. L-23033, January 5, 1967, 19 SCRA 5, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Lua Kian imported 2,000 cases of "Carnation" milk. The shipment was discharged into the custody of the Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator. However, only 1,829 cases marked "Lua Kian" were discharged, while 3,171 cases marked "Cebu United" were discharged from the same vessel [1, 2]. The Bill of Lading for Cebu United only indicated a shipment of 3,000 cases, while Lua Kian's Bill of Lading called for 2,000 cases [3]. Despite the discrepancy between the markings and the Bills of Lading, MPS delivered 1,913 cases to Lua Kian, resulting in a shortage of 87 cases [4]. Lua Kian filed a suit for recovery of the invoice value of the missing cases. MPS contended that since it only received 1,829 cases marked for Lua Kian, it had actually over-delivered and should not be liable [3]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Lua Kian [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the arrastre operator is liable for the shortage of goods delivered to the consignee despite discrepancies in the markings of the cargo.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the legal relationship between an arrastre operator and a consignee is akin to that of a depositor and warehouseman [5]. As a custodian, the arrastre operator has a duty to take good care of the goods and turn them over to the proper party.

In this case, MPS had possession of the Bills of Lading which showed that Cebu United was entitled to only 3,000 cases and Lua Kian to 2,000 cases [3]. The discharge of 3,171 cases marked for Cebu United (an excess of 171) and only 1,829 for Lua Kian (a shortage of 171) created a dilemma that should have alerted MPS [3]. Instead of delivering the goods, MPS should have withheld delivery and conducted its own investigation or required the parties to interplead, similar to the procedure under Sections 17 and 18 of the Warehouse Receipts Law, to determine the rightful owner [5]. Although Section 12 of the Management Contract usually exempts the operator from liability for improper marking, it does not apply here because the Bills of Lading provided sufficient notice of the correct ownership [6].

The judgment appealed from is **AFFIRMED** with the modification that attorney's fees are reduced to P300.00 [7, 8].
