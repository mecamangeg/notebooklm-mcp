I. CAPTION
ADELAIDA TANEGA v. HON. HONORATO B. MASAKAYAN and CHIEF OF POLICE OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-27191, February 28, 1967, 19 SCRA 564, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Adelaida Tanega was convicted of slander by the City Court of Quezon City and sentenced to 20 days of *arresto menor* and a fine of P100.00 [1]. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals [1]. On January 11, 1965, the trial court ordered the execution of the sentence, which was deferred to February 12, 1965, upon Tanega's motion [2]. However, she failed to appear on the appointed date [2]. The court issued warrants for her arrest, but she was never apprehended [2].

On December 10, 1966, Tanega moved to quash the warrants, arguing that the penalty had prescribed [2]. She contended that under Article 92 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), light penalties like *arresto menor* prescribe in one year, and more than a year had elapsed since she failed to appear for execution [3]. The respondent Judge denied the motion, ruling that the penalty must be served [3]. Tanega filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of imprisonment prescribed because the petitioner failed to appear for the execution of her sentence for more than one year.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that for the prescription of a penalty of imprisonment to commence, the culprit must evade the service of the sentence by escaping during the term of such imprisonment [4].

Under Article 93 of the Revised Penal Code, the period of prescription commences to run from the date the culprit should "evade the service of his sentence" [3]. The Court interpreted "evasion of service of sentence" in relation to Article 157 of the RPC, which defines it as escaping during the term of imprisonment by reason of final judgment [5, 6]. The essence of evasion is "jail breaking" [6]. Therefore, one can only escape after having started the service of the sentence [7].

In this case, although the petitioner was sentenced to imprisonment by final judgment, she was never placed in confinement [4]. Since she never started serving her sentence, she could not have evaded it. Consequently, the prescription of the penalty never began to run [4].

The petition for certiorari and prohibition was dismissed [4].
