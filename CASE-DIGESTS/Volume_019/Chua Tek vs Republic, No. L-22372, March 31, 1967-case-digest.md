I. CAPTION
CHUA TEK alias SENANDO TAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22372, March 31, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellee Chua Tek filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Quezon granted. The Republic appealed, challenging his qualifications. Chua Tek claimed an annual income of P6,000 to support his wife and seven children, though his income tax returns for 1959 and 1960 showed significantly lower net incomes [1, 2]. Evidence showed he used multiple aliases (e.g., Sisenando Tan, Sisenando Nadres) in official documents like residence and marriage certificates without judicial authority [3]. Additionally, two of his children were enrolled in Tayabas Sun Yat Sen School, a Chinese school, though he transferred them to a public school during the pendency of the case to cure the defect [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative income sufficient for naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner’s use of aliases without judicial authority is fatal to his petition.
3. W/N the enrollment of petitioner's children in a Chinese school disqualifies him.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Even assuming the petitioner's annual income is P6,000, it is insufficient to characterize him as having a lucrative profession or occupation, considering he has a wife and seven children—all of school age—and the high cost of living [2]. The Court cited *Keng Giok v. Republic*, *Lao Cui v. Republic*, and *Justo Tan v. Republic* to support this requirement [2].

2. **YES.** The unauthorized use of aliases is fatal to the petition. The record confirmed Chua Tek used various names (e.g., Sisenando Tan Chua Tek, Sisenando Nadres) in official documents without securing the requisite judicial authority, which is a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142 [3].

3. **YES.** The enrollment of his children in a Chinese school disqualifies him. Enrolling children in a school intended mainly for Chinese or children of Chinese descent evinces the absence of a sincere desire to embrace the customs and traditions of the Filipinos [4]. The transfer of the children to a public school during the pendency of the case does not alter the case, as it was evidently done to evade unfavorable implications [4].

Decision reversed; petition dismissed [5].
