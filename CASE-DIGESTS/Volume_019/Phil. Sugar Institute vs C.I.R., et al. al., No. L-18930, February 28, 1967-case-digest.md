I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE SUGAR INSTITUTE v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and INSUREFCO & PAPER PULP PROJECT WORKER’S UNION, G.R. No. L-18930, February 28, 1967, 19 SCRA 471, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Sugar Institute's predecessor, Insular Refining, had a collective bargaining agreement granting leave and overtime benefits to workers. Six policemen, excluded from the initial agreement, filed a petition for extra compensation. On August 2, 1954, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) ordered the company to grant them additional compensation and "privileges and facilities" enjoyed by other employees.

However, the policemen were laid off on March 31, 1954. Upon resuming operations in October 1954, the company refused to reinstate four of them (Rarang, Abaño, Abuton, and Villamor). The CIR declared the refusal discriminatory and ordered their reinstatement with back wages from October 11, 1954. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1960.

After reinstatement in November 1960, the respondent Union filed a petition for execution, claiming the money value of "privileges and facilities" (shoes, khaki uniforms, helmets, and accumulated vacation/sick leaves) corresponding to the six-year layoff period. The CIR granted the petition. Petitioner appealed, arguing procedural defects regarding its motion to dismiss and contending that the policemen were not entitled to facilities and leaves for a period they did not actually work.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a formal hearing is necessary for a motion to dismiss based on lack of cause of action in the CIR.
2. W/N the illegally laid-off policemen are entitled to the money value of "facilities" (shoes, uniforms, helmets) for the period they were not in the service.
3. W/N the illegally laid-off policemen are entitled to vacation and sick leave benefits for the period they were not in the service.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A formal hearing is not necessary. The CIR is not bound by technical rules of evidence or legal forms and may act according to justice and equity [1, 2]. When a motion to dismiss is based on the lack of a cause of action, the court determines sufficiency based solely on the data or facts within the petition itself, making a hearing unnecessary [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The portion of the decision subject to execution is that decreed in the dispositive part [5, 6]. The "facilities" consisting of shoes, khaki suitings, helmets, and ponchos were intended for official use during the policemen's actual tour of duty within company premises. Since the policemen were not in the actual performance of police work during the layoff period, they are not entitled to these items or their money value, even if they were technically in the service due to the reinstatement order [6, 7].

3. **YES.** The policemen are entitled to vacation and sick leaves. Under Sections 284 and 285-A of the Revised Administrative Code, such leaves are cumulative [8, 9]. The employees failed to work during the six-year period not through their own fault, but due to the discriminatory act of the employer. It is just and proper that they receive the leave benefits they would have enjoyed had they not been illegally dismissed, in addition to back wages [10, 11].

**Petition is GRANTED in part. The CIR order is modified to delete the award of shoes, uniforms, and helmets. The award of leave benefits is affirmed.**
