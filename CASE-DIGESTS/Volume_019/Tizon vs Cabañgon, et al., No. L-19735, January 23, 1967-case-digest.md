I. CAPTION
TRINIDAD YAPTANGCO VDA. DE TIZON v. DOMINGO CABAÑGON, as Judge of the Court of Agrarian Relations, and ROMUALDO DAVID, G.R. No. L-19735, January 23, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Romualdo David was the tenant of Petitioner Trinidad Yaptangco Vda. de Tizon on two separate landholdings in Pampanga (one in San Bartolome and another in Sto. Tomas) since 1942. The sharing arrangement was originally 55-45 in favor of the tenant. In February 1960, David petitioned the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for reliquidation of the 1959-1960 crop and previous years, claiming entitlement to a higher share based on the classification of the lands and his contributions. The CAR classified the San Bartolome land as second-class (producing <40 cavans/ha) and the Sto. Tomas land as first-class (producing >40 cavans/ha), awarding David 62.5% and 70% shares respectively. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the two holdings should be treated as one unit (which would make the average yield first-class) and that the change in sharing lacked the required notice under Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act. She also disclaimed liability for years managed by her aunt.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N separate landholdings cultivated by the same tenant should be classified separately to determine whether they are first or second-class ricelands.
2. W/N the enforcement of a sharing ratio based on actual contributions requires prior notice under Section 14 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act.
3. W/N the landowner is liable for reliquidation covering crop years managed by her agent.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that for purposes of classification, the production of each area must be taken into account separately. Sections 32 and 33 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act base the share basis "on ricelands," not on the person tilling. Since the San Bartolome land averaged only 37 cavans/ha, it was correctly classified as second-class, while the Sto. Tomas land, averaging 54 cavans/ha, was first-class [1-3].

2. **NO.** Section 14, regarding the right to change the tenancy contract/system, does not apply to the enforcement of the crop-sharing ratio in accordance with *actual contributions*. Since the tenant contributed all items except the land (and half of transplanting for the second-class land), he is entitled to the corresponding legal share (Sec. 32 and 33). To deny this would violate Section 11(a) and Section 34 of the Act, as well as the principle against unjust enrichment [4-6].

3. **YES.** The petitioner judicially admitted in her answer that the respondent had been her tenant since 1942. The fact that her aunt managed the farms during the years in question does not absolve her of liability for reliquidation [7, 8].

Judgment affirmed.
