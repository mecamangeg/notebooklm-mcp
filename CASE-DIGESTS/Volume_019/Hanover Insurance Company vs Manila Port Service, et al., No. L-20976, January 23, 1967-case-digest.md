I. CAPTION
HANOVER INSURANCE COMPANY v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-20976, January 23, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On September 30, 1961, a shipment consigned to General Paint Corporation (Philippines) Inc. arrived in Manila from Germany via the vessel "Hamburg Maru." The cargo was discharged into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service, a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company. When the consignee attempted to take delivery, one drum of anti-skinning agent was missing. Hanover Insurance Company, as the insurer, paid the consignee P1,089.47 for the loss [1-3].

As subrogee, Hanover filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against the carrier (Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line) and the arrastre operator (Manila Port Service) in the alternative, stating it was uncertain who was responsible for the loss. The trial court dismissed the complaint against the Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad Company, ruling that the claim of P1,089.47 fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal court, not the CFI, resulting in a misjoinder of causes of action [3]. Hanover appealed directly to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over a claim against an arrastre operator involving an amount within the municipal court's jurisdiction when joined alternatively with an admiralty action against a carrier.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the CFI has jurisdiction over both causes of action. Under Section 5, Rule 2 of the Revised Rules of Court, a plaintiff uncertain against which of several persons they are entitled to relief may join them as defendants in the alternative [4, 5].

The action against the carrying vessel constitutes an action in admiralty, which falls under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the CFI regardless of the amount involved [6]. The Court applied the doctrine in *Rizal Surety & Insurance Company v. Manila Railroad Company* (G.R. No. L-20875) and *International Harvester Co. v. Aragon*, ruling that since one of the causes of action (admiralty) is cognizable by the CFI, the suit should be filed there, even if the other cause of action (contract of deposit against the arrastre), standing alone, would fall within the municipal court's jurisdiction [7]. This joinder avoids unnecessary multiplicity of suits and prevents the plaintiff from having to prove the same case in different courts [8].

The order of dismissal is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the trial court for trial on the merits [8].
