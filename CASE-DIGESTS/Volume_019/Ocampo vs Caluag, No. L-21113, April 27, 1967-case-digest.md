I. CAPTION
MIGUEL OCAMPO v. HON. HERMOGENES CALUAG and DR. GREGORIO VENTURANZA, G.R. No. L-21113, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Miguel Ocampo filed a complaint for damages against Respondent Dr. Gregorio Venturanza. Venturanza’s counsel received notice of the trial but failed to appear. Consequently, the trial court allowed Ocampo to present evidence *ex parte* and rendered a decision on March 19, 1962, ordering Venturanza to pay damages and attorney’s fees. Venturanza’s counsel received a copy of the decision on March 27, 1962.

On April 30, 1962—four days after the period to file a motion for reconsideration had expired—Venturanza’s counsel filed a motion for reconsideration and relief from judgment, claiming excusable negligence because his clerk fell ill and forgot to transmit the hearing notice. The court initially denied this motion and granted Ocampo’s motion for execution on July 10, 1962. However, upon a subsequent motion by Venturanza, respondent Judge Caluag *motu proprio* issued an order on November 12, 1962, setting aside the March 19 decision and reopening the case for trial. Ocampo filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent Judge had jurisdiction to set aside the decision of March 19, 1962.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the decision had become final and executory.

Venturanza's counsel received the decision on March 27, 1962, and had until April 26, 1962, to appeal or move for reconsideration under Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Since no motion was filed within this period, the judgment became final as a matter of course. Once a decision is final and executory, it is removed from the power or jurisdiction of the court to alter, amend, or revoke; the court’s only remaining power is to order its execution.

Furthermore, relief from judgment under Rule 38 is only available for fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence. The Court rejected the counsel's explanation regarding his clerk's illness and forgetfulness, characterizing it as a "hackneyed and habitual subterfuge" that does not constitute excusable negligence (*Philippine Air Lines vs. Arca*). Finally, the Court reiterated the settled rule that clients are bound by the errors and negligence of their counsel (*Montes vs. Court of First Instance of Tayabas*).

Petition is **GRANTED**. The order reopening the case is revoked, and the respondent Judge is ordered to issue the writ of execution.
