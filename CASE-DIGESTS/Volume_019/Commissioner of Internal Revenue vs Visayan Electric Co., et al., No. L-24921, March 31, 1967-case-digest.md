I. CAPTION
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. VISAYAN ELECTRIC COMPANY and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24921, March 31, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Visayan Electric Company (VEC) for deficiency income tax (P2,443.30), a 25% surcharge for late payment of franchise tax (P35,419.05), and additional residence tax (P3,850.00) for the years 1953-1959 [1]. VEC appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA). The CTA rendered a decision absolving VEC from the deficiency income tax and franchise tax surcharge but ordered VEC to pay the additional residence tax of P3,850.00 [1, 2].

The CIR appealed the portion of the decision absolving VEC of the income tax and franchise tax surcharge to the Supreme Court [3]. However, VEC did not appeal the portion adjudging it liable for the residence tax [3]. While the CIR's appeal was pending, the CIR moved for the execution of the judgment regarding the P3,850.00 residence tax [4]. The CTA denied the motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration, prompting the CIR to file a petition for certiorari and mandamus [2, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government is entitled to a writ of execution for the portion of the CTA judgment (residence tax) that was not appealed by the taxpayer, despite the pendency of the government's appeal on other portions of the decision.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the judgment regarding the residence tax had become final and executory. A judgment becomes final by operation of law upon the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal if no appeal is perfected [5]. Since VEC did not appeal the order to pay the P3,850.00 residence tax, that portion of the judgment acquired finality, entitling the CIR to a writ of execution as a matter of right and making its issuance a ministerial duty of the court [5].

The Court held that where a portion of a single judgment is (1) not the subject of appeal, (2) separable and distinct from the portions under appeal, (3) needs no further proceedings, and (4) has acquired finality, it may be enforced by execution [6]. Here, the three tax items (income, franchise, and residence) involved separate findings of fact and law and were distinct from one another [7]. Furthermore, Section 4, Rule 44 of the Rules of Court, which provides that an appeal "shall stay" the decision of the CTA, applies only to the portion of the decision that is the subject matter of the appeal [8]. Finally, equitable considerations demanded prompt execution as the tax amount did not earn interest, and delay would prejudice the government [8].

The petition is granted, the CTA resolutions are set aside, and the CTA is directed to issue the writ of execution [9].
