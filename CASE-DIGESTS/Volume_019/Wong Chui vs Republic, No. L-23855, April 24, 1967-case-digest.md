I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF WONG CHUI TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. WONG CHUI v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23855, April 24, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Wong Chui, born in Manila in 1924, applied for naturalization as a Filipino citizen. He was registered at birth as "Modesto Gonzales Wong Way Chui." However, throughout his residence, he used various other names without judicial authority: "Wong Chee Kan" during his schooling, "Wong Way Chui" in his children's birth certificates, and "Wong Chui" in his amended petition. To support his petition, he presented Antero S. Sarreal and Rosario Rivera as character witnesses. The Court of First Instance of Manila granted the petition. The Republic appealed, arguing that Wong Chui failed to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner due to the unauthorized use of aliases and that his character witnesses were not credible.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's use of aliases disqualifies him from acquiring Philippine citizenship.
2. W/N the character witnesses presented were competent to vouch for the petitioner.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The use of aliases without judicial authority disqualifies the petitioner. The Court ruled that Wong Chui's use of names different from the one with which he was christened, such as "Wong Chee Kan" and "Wong Way Chui," violated Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law). This violation indicates that he has not conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire stay in the Philippines, rendering him unfit for naturalization [1].

2. **NO.** The character witnesses were not competent. Under the law, witnesses must be able to vouch for the petitioner's good moral character and behavior during the "entire period of the alien’s residence in the Philippines." Witness Sarreal only knew the petitioner as a student from 1939 to 1940, while Witness Rivera only met him in 1947 and displayed a lack of knowledge regarding his personal life, failing to identify his source of income or his faith [2].

Accordingly, the judgment is **REVERSED**, and the petition is **DENIED** [3].
