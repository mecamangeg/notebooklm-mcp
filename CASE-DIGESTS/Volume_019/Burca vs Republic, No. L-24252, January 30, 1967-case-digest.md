I. CAPTION
**IN RE PETITION TO DECLARE ZITA NGO TO POSSESS ALL QUALIFICATIONS AND NONE OF THE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR NATURALIZATION UNDER COMMONWEALTH ACT 473 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CANCELLING HER ALIEN REGISTRY WITH THE BUREAU OF IMMIGRATION. ZITA NGO BURCA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-24252, January 30, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Zita Ngo Burca, a Chinese citizen born in Surigao, married Florencio Burca, a Filipino citizen, in 1961 [1, 2]. She filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte to be declared as possessing all qualifications and none of the disqualifications for naturalization under Commonwealth Act No. 473, for the purpose of cancelling her alien registry [3]. The Solicitor General opposed, arguing that there is no judicial proceeding for the declaration of citizenship and that the petition was fatally defective for failing to state former places of residence and lacking affidavits from character witnesses [4]. The CFI ruled in her favor, declaring her a Filipino citizen [5]. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N an alien woman automatically becomes a Filipino citizen upon marriage to a Filipino citizen.
2. W/N there is a valid judicial proceeding for the declaration of citizenship.
3. W/N the petitioner’s application for citizenship should be granted.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 15 of the Revised Naturalization Law, an alien woman marrying a Filipino is not automatically deemed a citizen; she is "deemed" a citizen only if she "might herself be lawfully naturalized" [6]. This requires proof that she possesses all qualifications under Section 2 and none of the disqualifications under Section 4 of the law [7]. The privilege of citizenship is not handed out blindly solely on the basis of marriage [8].

2. **NO.** There is no law or rule authorizing a proceeding solely for the declaration of Philippine citizenship, nor is citizenship a proper subject for declaratory relief [9]. However, the Court ruled that an alien woman married to a Filipino must file a "petition for citizenship" in the competent court (CFI) to acquire such status [10, 11]. Any action by an administrative agency declaring an alien wife a citizen is void; the determination rests exclusively with competent courts [11].

3. **NO.** Although the Court treated the petition as one for naturalization, it was fatally defective [12]. First, the petitioner failed to state her former residence in Cebu where she studied for one year, violating Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law which requires a recital of present and former places of residence [13]. Second, she failed to submit affidavits of two credible character witnesses, relying solely on her own testimony, which deprives the State of the opportunity to check her standing in the community [14].

**Judgment reversed and petition dismissed.**
