I. CAPTION
**JOSE V. HILARIO, JR. v. THE CITY OF MANILA, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS, CITY ENGINEER OF MANILA, FERNANDO BUSUEGO and EUGENIO SESE, G.R. No. L-19570, April 27, 1967, 126 Phil. 115, Bengzon, J.P., J.**

II. FACTS
Jose Hilario, Jr. is the registered owner of a parcel of land in San Mateo, Rizal. In 1937, a great flood caused the San Mateo River to leave its original bed and meander into Hilario's estate, segregating a strip of land. From 1945 onwards, the U.S. Army and subsequently the defendants (City of Manila and Bureau of Public Works) extracted gravel and sand from this strip along the new course of the river.

Hilario filed a suit for injunction and damages, claiming the extractions were made from his private property. Defendants argued that the extraction sites were within the riverbanks and riverbed, which are of public ownership. The Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed the complaint against the City of Manila but ruled that the northern two-fifths of the disputed area belonged to Hilario as private property, enjoining the other defendants from extracting materials there. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the new riverbanks formed when a river changes its course through a private estate are of public ownership.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that all riverbanks are of public ownership, including those formed when a river leaves its old bed and opens a new course through a private estate.

Under Article 339 of the old Civil Code (which governed the 1937 change of course), riverbanks are expressly listed as property of public ownership. Furthermore, Article 73 of the Law of Waters of 1866 defines "banks of a river" as those lateral strips or zones of its bed which are washed by the stream only during such high floods as do not cause inundations. Since the riverbank is legally considered part of the riverbed, and Article 372 of the old Civil Code declares new beds entering private estates as public ownership, the new banks are necessarily of public ownership as well. A river is a compound concept consisting of the running waters, the bed, and the banks; its nature is implicitly public in all its parts.

The Court noted that while the *Siete Partidas* previously allowed private ownership of banks by riparian owners, this was repealed by the Law of Waters of 1866. As the defendants confined their extractions within the lateral extremities of the banks (the zone reached by non-inundating ordinary floods), they extracted from the public domain and are not liable for damages.

The decision and orders appealed from are **SET ASIDE**. The defendants are absolved from liability, and the portion of the strip of land outside the established riverbanks is confirmed as Hilario's private property.
