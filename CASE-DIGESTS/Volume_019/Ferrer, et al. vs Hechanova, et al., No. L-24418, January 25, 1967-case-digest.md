I. CAPTION
ALEJANDRO FERRER, TEODORO P. FOJAS, OCTAVIO HERNANDEZ and JESUS GARCIA v. HON. RUFINO HECHANOVA, in his capacity as Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. No. L-24418, January 25, 1967, 19 SCRA 106, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ferrer, Fojas, Garcia, and Hernandez were employees of the Bureau of Customs. Ferrer held a provisional appointment, while the others were issued "permanent" appointments. Ferrer, Garcia, and Hernandez were not civil service eligibles, while Fojas possessed a second-grade eligibility that was not appropriate for his position. Between 1962 and 1963, the respondents (Secretary of Finance and Commissioner of Customs) dismissed the petitioners from service on the ground of "loss of confidence."

Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus for reinstatement. The Court of First Instance dismissed the petition, ruling that since the petitioners lacked the necessary civil service eligibility, their appointments were temporary in nature and terminable at the pleasure of the appointing power. On appeal, petitioners argued that their positions were declared "primarily confidential" by executive orders, thus exempting them from eligibility requirements.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners' positions are primarily confidential in nature.
2. W/N the dismissal of the petitioners on the ground of "loss of confidence" was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under the Civil Service Act of 1959, it is the nature of the functions attached to the position that determines whether it is primarily confidential, policy-determining, or highly technical, regardless of prior executive orders [1]. In the absence of proven facts showing close intimacy and trust between the appointing power and the appointees, the positions cannot be deemed primarily confidential (*Piñero v. Hechanova*) [2], [1].

2. **NO.** Since the positions are not primarily confidential, "loss of confidence" is not a valid ground for dismissal for appointees in the classified service [3], [4]. However, the Court ruled that despite being designated as "permanent," petitioners Fojas, Garcia, and Hernandez were actually **provisional appointees** because permanent appointment implies civil service eligibility, which they lacked or was inappropriate for their positions (*Sigue v. Rayabaya*) [5], [6]. A provisional appointment is good only until replacement by a civil service eligible and not beyond 30 days from the receipt of the certificate of eligibles [5]. Consequently, while they cannot be dismissed for loss of confidence, their reinstatement is subject to replacement by qualified eligibles [4].

The judgment of the lower court was **SET ASIDE**, and respondents were ordered to reinstate petitioners with back salaries.
