I. CAPTION
UNITED INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. v. ROYAL INTEROCEAN LINES, ET AL., MANILA PORT SERVICE and/or MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-22688, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
United Insurance Company, Inc. insured a shipment of 3,768 cases of corned beef consigned to Visayan Commercial. The shipment arrived in Manila on October 4, 1961, aboard the S/S "Straat Van Diemen," owned by Royal Interocean Lines. The cargo was discharged to the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service (a subsidiary of Manila Railroad Company), but was short by 66 cases upon delivery to the consignee.

United Insurance paid the consignee P3,371.43 for the loss and was subrogated to its rights. Uncertain whether the loss occurred while the goods were with the carrier or the arrastre operator, United Insurance filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against both Royal Interocean Lines and Manila Port Service/Manila Railroad Company as alternative defendants.

The CFI found Manila Port Service/Manila Railroad Company liable for the shortage. They appealed, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction over them because the claim of P3,371.43 was below the court's jurisdictional amount. They also claimed the action was time-barred under the Management Contract because no claim for value was filed within 15 days of discharge.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction over a money claim below its jurisdictional amount when joined with an admiralty suit against an alternative defendant.
2. W/N a provisional claim filed within the 15-day period constitutes compliance with the Management Contract.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the case was properly filed in the CFI. Under the Rules of Court, a party may join as many alternative causes of action as they have against an opposing party. While the claim against the arrastre operator was below the jurisdictional amount, it was joined with an action for breach of contract of carriage (admiralty) against Royal Interocean Lines, which falls within the CFI's jurisdiction [1]. Where one of the alternative causes of action is cognizable by the CFI, the court acquires jurisdiction over the entire case, including causes that would otherwise fall under the jurisdiction of inferior courts [2].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the filing of a provisional claim within the prescribed 15-day period is sufficient compliance with Section 15 of the Management Contract. The record showed a provisional claim was filed on October 8, 1961, only three days after the cargo was discharged [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
