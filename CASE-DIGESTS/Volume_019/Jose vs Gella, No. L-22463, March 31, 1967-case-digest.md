I. CAPTION
ALFREDO A. JOSE v. HON. VICENTE G. GELLA, as Treasurer of the Philippines, et al., G.R. No. L-22463, March 31, 1967, 19 SCRA 692, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Guillermo E. Sultan was the owner of a Backpay Acknowledgment Certificate which he sold and assigned to petitioner Alfredo A. Jose for consideration on November 12, 1958 [1]. Sultan also executed a special power of attorney authorizing Jose to collect the proceeds [1]. However, when Jose filed his claim, Sultan denied the sale, leading the Office of the Treasurer to withhold payment and threaten to release the funds to Sultan [2, 3]. Jose filed a petition for *mandamus* in the Court of First Instance against the National Treasurer and Sultan to compel the release of the treasury warrant in his favor [3].

The trial court rendered judgment declaring the transfer of rights valid and ordered the Treasurer to cancel Sultan's warrant and issue a new one to Jose [4]. Sultan did not appeal this decision [5]. The Treasurer appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the assignment failed to comply with the specific requirements of Rep. Act No. 304 (Backpay Law), which requires a specific application for a negotiable certificate of indebtedness rather than a mere ordinary sale [5]. The Treasurer also argued that *mandamus* was improper and that Jose should have first filed an action for specific performance against Sultan to compel compliance with the legal requirements [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the *mandamus* action may be treated as a suit for specific performance to enforce the assignment of backpay rights.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the action may be treated as a suit for specific performance to avoid technicalities, multiplicity of suits, and expensive, dilatory proceedings [7, 8].

The Court noted that Sultan was a party to the case and the trial court had already declared the assignment valid and effective—a judgment Sultan did not appeal [5, 8]. Since the validity of the transfer was judicially settled with finality against the assignor, requiring a separate suit for specific performance to compel Sultan to execute the administrative forms required by the Treasurer would be superfluous. The final judgment against Sultan in the *mandamus* proceeding served the purpose of a suit for specific performance [8].

Decision affirmed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
