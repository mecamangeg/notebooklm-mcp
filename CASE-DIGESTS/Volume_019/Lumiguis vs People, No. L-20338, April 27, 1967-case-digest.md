**I. CAPTION**
**BANAGAN LUMIGUIS, RAMON SUBANO, SEDINAN SUBANO and KAMBA LUMIGUIS v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-20338, April 27, 1967, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
On April 12, 1959, in Zamboanga del Norte, Godo Idlay engaged in a fistfight with petitioner Kamba Lumiguis and knocked him down. Dungo-an Abao, Kamba's uncle, then struck Godo on the back of the head with a piece of wood, causing Godo to fall face down. While Godo was on the ground, Kamba stood up and struck him on the forehead with wood. Petitioners Banagan Lumiguis, Ramon Subano, and Sedinan Subano followed, alternately hitting Godo on the back with bamboo and wood. Godo died the next day from a skull fracture.

The Court of Appeals convicted Dungo-an Abao as principal and the petitioners as accomplices to the crime. Petitioners appealed, contending that since Dungo-an delivered the mortal blow, Banagan and Ramon should only be convicted of physical injuries, and Kamba should be acquitted.

**III. ISSUES**
1. W/N the petitioners are criminally liable as accomplices for homicide despite striking the victim after the fatal blow was delivered.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength can be appreciated against the accomplices.
3. W/N the civil liability of the principal and accomplices is joint and several (solidary) for the entire amount.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** The Court held that the infliction of wounds by a co-accused after the principal accused has delivered the fatal blow shows actual participation in the criminal design. Therefore, such co-accused is guilty in the character of an accomplice. Citing *People v. Cortes*, the Court affirmed that where one inflicts a fatal blow and others immediately inflict minor injuries, the latter are properly convicted as accomplices.

2. **NO.** Abuse of superior strength cannot be appreciated against accomplices. To estimate this aggravating circumstance based on the participation of multiple attackers, it must appear they cooperated to weaken the defense, which would make them principals. Since the Court found they were only accomplices, it implies they did not cooperate in the manner necessary to constitute abuse of superior strength.

3. **NO.** Under Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code, the liability is not entirely solidary. The sole principal is primarily liable for his own part of the indemnity and subsidiarily liable for the portion adjudged against the accomplices. The accomplices are solidarily liable *among themselves* for the portion adjudged against them, and subsidiarily liable for the portion of the principal.

**Disposition:** The judgment is MODIFIED. The petitioners are sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 months and 1 day to 6 years (minimum) to 8 years and 1 day to 10 years (maximum), and the civil liability is apportioned according to Article 110 of the RPC.
