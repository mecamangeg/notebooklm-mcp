I. CAPTION
JAIME HERNANDEZ v. DELFIN ALBANO, HERMOGENES CONCEPCION, JR., City Fiscal of Manila and CARLOS C. GONZALES, Second Assistant City Fiscal of Manila, G.R. No. L-19272, January 25, 1967, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Delfin Albano filed a complaint with the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila against Petitioner Jaime Hernandez, the then Secretary of Finance and Presiding Officer of the Monetary Board. The complaint charged Hernandez with violations of Article VII, Section 11(2) of the Constitution (punishable under Commonwealth Act No. 626) and Section 13 of Republic Act No. 265 (The Central Bank Act). The charges were based on Hernandez's alleged shareholdings in various corporations (including Bicol Electric Co., Rural Bank of Nueva Caceres, and University of Nueva Caceres) which obtained dollar allocations from the Central Bank during his incumbency.

Hernandez sought the dismissal of the charges during the preliminary investigation, arguing that: (1) venue was improperly laid in Manila, as the corporations (except University of the East) were domiciled in Naga City and Mandaluyong, and the "situs of shares" should determine the venue; and (2) a violation of Section 13 of R.A. 265 is not criminal in nature. The investigating Fiscal denied the dismissal. Hernandez then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain the investigation. The CFI dismissed the petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the City Fiscal of Manila has jurisdiction (venue) to investigate the charges against the petitioner.
2. W/N a violation of Section 13 of Republic Act No. 265 is criminal in nature.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The City Fiscal of Manila has jurisdiction because essential ingredients of the offense occurred in Manila. Under Section 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, a criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the municipality or province where the offense was committed or where *any one of the essential ingredients thereof took place*. While the petitioner argued that the venue should be the domicile of the corporations where the shares are held, the Court ruled that possession of prohibited interests is only one component of the offense. An equally necessary ingredient is the fact that the petitioner was a Department Head and Chairman of the Monetary Board who had to act officially in his dual capacity in Manila, where he held office. Since an essential ingredient took place in Manila, the Manila Fiscals have the authority to investigate.

2. **YES.** The violation is criminal in nature. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument that Section 15 of R.A. 265 provides only for civil sanctions (liability for loss or injury). Section 34 of the same Act explicitly provides a penal sanction, stating that "Whenever any person or entity wilfully violates this Act... the person or persons responsible for such violation shall be punished by a fine... and by imprisonment." Section 15 does not negate Section 34; to hold otherwise would sanction "pointless rigidity in statutory construction."

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED**.
