I. CAPTION
TAN GUAN v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and THE COMMISSIONER OF THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-23676, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
In 1947, petitioner Tan Guan and Sia Lin organized the Philippine Surplus Company, a general partnership [1]. For the year 1948, the partnership claimed business expense deductions amounting to P206,870.00. Tan Guan filed his income tax return on April 18, 1949 [1, 2]. In 1954, acting on a confidential report, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) investigated and discovered that these expenses were fictitious as they were unsupported by receipts, the payees' names were erased, and the alleged payees did not report the sums in their own returns [3, 4].

The BIR treated the disallowed amount as income of the partners and assessed Tan Guan a deficiency income tax. While an initial assessment in 1956 was unserved, a subsequent assessment was issued on January 8, 1957 [2, 4]. Tan Guan appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that the right to assess had prescribed as more than five years had passed since his 1949 return, and that he could not produce receipts because the five-year retention period under the Tax Code had expired [2, 5]. The CTA affirmed the Commissioner's assessment [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Commissioner of Internal Revenue’s right to assess the deficiency tax has prescribed.
2. W/N the business expenses claimed by the partnership should be disallowed for being fictitious.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Commissioner's right to assess has not prescribed. While the general period is five years, Section 332(a) of the Tax Code provides for a ten-year period from the discovery of falsity or fraud [2]. The Court found Tan Guan’s return false and fraudulent because the claimed expenses were fictitious—proven by erased payee names and lack of receipts [7]. Since the fraud was discovered on August 10, 1954, the assessment issued on January 8, 1957, was well within the ten-year prescriptive period [2, 8].

2. **NO.** The expenses were correctly disallowed. The factual findings of the Commissioner and the CTA that the expenses were fictitious are presumed correct and were not rebutted by the petitioner [9]. Tan Guan's defense that he was no longer required to keep records was rejected because the BIR investigation occurred in 1954, which was still within the five-year preservation period required by Section 337 of the Tax Code [5]. Furthermore, the government is not bound by the errors of its agents, so the fact that Tan Guan's partner, Sia Lin, was absolved from liability does not exempt Tan Guan [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [10].
