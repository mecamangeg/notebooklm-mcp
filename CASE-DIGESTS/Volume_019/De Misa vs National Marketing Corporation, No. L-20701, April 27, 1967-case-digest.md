I. CAPTION
MARIA L. VDA. DE MISA and MILAGROS MISA GUTIERREZ v. NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-20701, April 27, 1967, 19 SCRA 1017, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Nicolas Misa, the acting second assistant general manager of the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (PRATRA), was suspended on September 16, 1950, pending criminal charges [1]. On October 3, 1950, PRATRA was abolished by Executive Order No. 350, which created the Price Stabilization Corporation (PRISCO) [2]. Misa was eventually acquitted on June 9, 1952 [2]. PRISCO paid Misa his salary up to October 2, 1950, the cash value of his unused leaves, and a gratuity for his service from 1946 to October 2, 1950 [2].

Misa demanded back salaries for the period of his suspension (September 16, 1950 to June 9, 1952) from PRISCO and later the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO), PRISCO's successor [2]. The claim was denied because Misa was not reappointed to PRISCO [2]. After Misa died in 1956, his heirs (petitioners) filed a complaint for recovery of the sum [3]. NAMARCO argued that Misa was validly separated from service for failure to be reappointed under E.O. 350 and that he was estopped by accepting his gratuity [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Misa was validly separated from service upon the abolition of PRATRA.
2. W/N the petitioners are estopped from questioning Misa's separation.
3. W/N NAMARCO is liable for the claim against PRISCO.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 12 of Executive Order No. 350, personnel of the dissolved PRATRA were transferred to PRISCO but required a reappointment within sixty days to remain employed; those not reappointed were considered separated from the service [6]. Misa was not reappointed. The Court held that his suspension did not place him beyond the purview of this requirement [6].

2. **YES.** Misa accepted and enjoyed his gratuity pay, salary up to October 2, 1950, and the money value of his unused leaves [7]. Citing *Lopez v. NAMARCO*, the Court ruled that an employee who accepts retirement benefits is estopped from questioning the validity of their separation or is deemed to have waived the right to contest it [8]. This estoppel binds his successors-in-interest [7].

3. **NO.** While NAMARCO succeeded PRISCO, Republic Act No. 1345 (Section 18(b)(2)) ordained that the settlement of PRISCO's liabilities be handled by the Board of Liquidators, a separate entity, not NAMARCO [9].

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed [10].
