I. CAPTION
LEON CLIMACO v. CARLOS SIY UY and MANUEL CO, G.R. No. L-21118, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On August 21, 1958, Leon Climaco filed an action for damages against Carlos Siy Uy and Manuel Co, alleging they maliciously charged him with estafa and conspired to file the case in Manila using a false address to mislead the fiscal. Climaco claimed this prosecution damaged his business credit, reputation, and caused him mental anguish.

On August 27, 1958, defendant Siy Uy died before summons could be served. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Climaco moved to amend the complaint to substitute the heirs of Siy Uy as defendants. The lower court initially granted the substitution but later reconsidered. On January 12, 1959, the lower court issued an order setting aside the substitution and dismissing the entire complaint against both defendants. Climaco appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action for damages based on malicious prosecution survives the death of defendant Siy Uy.
2. W/N the dismissal of the complaint against the surviving defendant, Manuel Co, was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action for damages against the deceased Siy Uy does not survive. Under Section 21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, an action for the recovery of money (damages) generally does not survive the death of the defendant. Furthermore, the action cannot be maintained against the estate under Section 1, Rule 87, which allows actions for "damages for an injury to person or property." The Supreme Court held that the damages Climaco sought (for injury to credit, reputation, and feelings) did not spring from an injury to his *person* within the meaning of the rules. Therefore, the lower court correctly denied the motion to substitute the heirs of Siy Uy.

2. **NO.** The dismissal of the case against Manuel Co was erroneous. Siy Uy was not the only defendant; Manuel Co was also named in the complaint. An action for damages can be maintained against the surviving defendant despite the death of the co-defendant.

**WHEREFORE**, the order appealed from is set aside insofar as it dismissed the case against defendant Manuel Co, and the record of this case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
