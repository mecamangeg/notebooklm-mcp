I. CAPTION
C.N. HODGES v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF THE CITY OF ILOILO, et al., G.R. No. L-18276, January 12, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On June 7, 1960, the Municipal Board of Iloilo City enacted Ordinance 31, imposing a tax of one-half of one percent (½ of 1%) on the contract price of real property sold within the city [1]. Section 3 of the ordinance expressly provided that the payment of said tax was a requirement for the registration of the sale in the Office of the Register of Deeds [1]. C.N. Hodges, a businessman engaged in buying and selling real estate, filed an action for declaratory relief challenging the ordinance as *ultra vires* [2]. The City contended that the ordinance was valid under its charter and the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264), and that Hodges failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing to the Secretary of Finance [3], [4]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled in favor of Hodges, annulling the ordinance and ordering the City to reimburse him [5], [3]. The City appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the City of Iloilo has the power to impose a tax on the sale of real property.
3. W/N the ordinance is valid insofar as it prohibits the registration of the sale with the Register of Deeds until the tax is paid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The issue raised—whether the ordinance is beyond the power of the City Council to enact—is purely legal, for which no administrative relief is available from the Secretary of Finance [6]. Under Section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act, the Secretary's power to suspend an ordinance is limited to cases where the tax is "unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory," not when it is *ultra vires* [7], [6]. Furthermore, the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies applies only when there is an express legal provision making it a condition precedent to court action [6].

2. **YES.** Section 2 of the Local Autonomy Act grants chartered cities plenary taxing power, subject only to the limitation that the tax is for public purposes, just, and uniform, and does not fall within the specific exceptions listed in the law [8]. A tax on the sale of real property is not among the statutory exceptions [8]. Applying the maxim *Exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non exceptis* (The exception confirms the rule in cases not excepted), the tax is valid [8].

3. **NO.** The requirement that the tax be paid before registration is *ultra vires* because it imposes a condition for registration not provided for in the Land Registration Act (Act 496) or R.A. 456 [9], [10]. Only the Legislature has the power to add to or alter the requirements for the registration of voluntary conveyances [10]. While a municipal board may adopt means reasonably necessary to enforce its powers, such means cannot contravene superior statutory mandates [11]. The Court modified its previous ruling in *Hodges v. Municipal Board* (G.R. No. L-18129) regarding motor vehicles, clarifying that local ordinances cannot amend general laws on registration [10].

**Judgment modified.** Ordinance 31 is declared valid, except for the provision making tax payment a requirement for registration, which is declared void [12].
