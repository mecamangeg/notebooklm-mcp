I. CAPTION
RUFINO MARTINEZ, ET AL. v. UNION DE MAQUINISTAS, FOGONEROS Y MOTORMEN, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-19455–56, January 30, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Unions (Union de Maquinistas and Union de Empleados) staged a strike against the Manila Railroad Company (MRRCO) after failed negotiations. The dispute was certified to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). A settlement was reached granting a P15.00 temporary wage increase to union members. The CIR later made this increase permanent and applicable to every employee of MRRCO, including non-union members [1, 2].

Attorneys Carlos E. Santiago and Sisenando Villaluz, who represented the unions, filed a motion to extend their attorney's lien to the wage increases received by all other MRRCO employees who were not union members, arguing they benefited from the award. The CIR granted the motion on October 30, 1961 [3]. The twenty-four petitioners, non-union employees, challenged the order, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction, there was no lawyer-client relationship, and the award was issued summarily without due process [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the claim for attorney's fees.
2. W/N non-union employees are liable for attorney's fees for benefits secured by the union's counsel.
3. W/N the petitioners were denied due process.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction over the main labor dispute (Cases No. 17-IPA and 18-IPA). Consequently, it has full jurisdiction to consider and decide all matters collateral thereto, such as claims for attorney's fees made by the members of the bar who appeared in the case [4-6].

2. **YES.** Citing *Union de Empleados de Trenes vs. Kapisanan Ng Mga Manggagawa sa MRRCO* (G.R. No. L-14762), the Court ruled that lawyers who represent union members to secure benefits for all employees should be paid corresponding fees by all those favored by the award [5-8]. This aligns with the policy of encouraging unionism and prevents non-union employees from becoming "free riders" who receive benefits derived from the struggle of union members without risking anything or contributing to the cost [9]. However, the Court modified the award, reducing the fees to 5% for Atty. Santiago and 5% for Atty. Villaluz [10].

3. **NO.** The record shows petitioners were served notice of the motion and filed an opposition detailing their grounds. They also filed a motion for reconsideration with a lengthy memorandum. The fact that they filed an opposition implies the lower court held a hearing or at least gave them the opportunity to be heard before issuing the order [8, 11, 12].

The order appealed from is **MODIFIED**; the award is reduced to 5% for each lawyer on the amounts due as salary differentials to the petitioners [10].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, Reyes, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [10].
