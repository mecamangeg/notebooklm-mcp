I. CAPTION
FELIPE ACAR, ET AL. v. HON. INOCENCIO ROSAL, G.R. No. L-21707, March 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Ten farm laborers filed a class suit in the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental on behalf of themselves and 9,000 other laborers against Central Azucarera de Bais and other entities. They sought to recover shares amounting to over P14 million under Republic Act 809 (The Sugar Act of 1952) [1]. The petitioners filed a motion to litigate *in forma pauperis* under Section 22, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court to be exempt from the P14,500 docket fee, alleging they were laborers dependent solely on daily wages with no properties [2, 3].

Respondent Judge Rosal denied the motion. Relying on Black's Law Dictionary, the Judge ruled that a "pauper" is strictly "a person so poor that he must be supported at public expense." Since the petitioners had regular employment and sources of income, the lower court held they were not paupers and denied their request for exemption [3, 4]. The petitioners filed a special civil action for certiorari and mandamus before the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners are entitled to litigate *in forma pauperis* despite being able-bodied and having employment.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the constitutional guarantee of "free access to the courts" demands a broad interpretation of the right to sue *in forma pauperis*. An applicant need not be a public charge to qualify; it is sufficient that the party is "indigent." The Court defined "indigent" as a person who has no property or source of income sufficient for support aside from their own labor, even if they are self-supporting when able to work [4].

The Court rejected the argument that the fee should be paid because it could be shared among the 9,000 laborers (amounting to approx. P1.60 each). In a class suit, the fee is a direct charge on the named parties. Furthermore, exacting even small amounts from seasonal farm laborers earning subsistence wages would defeat the salutary purpose of the Constitution [6]. The respondent Judge was ordered to grant the petition to litigate *in forma pauperis*. Petition granted [7].
