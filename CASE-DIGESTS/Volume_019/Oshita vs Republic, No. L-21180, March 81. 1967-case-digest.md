I. CAPTION
**IN THE MATTER OF THE CHANGE OF NAME OF ANTONINA B. OSHITA. ANTONINA B. OSHITA v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-21180, March 31, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonina B. Oshita filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao to change her name to "Antonina Bartolome." The petition was signed, subscribed, and sworn to by her, but it lacked the verification required by the Rules of Court. The Solicitor General moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the lack of verification meant the court lacked jurisdiction. The CFI denied the motion to dismiss.

During the hearing, Antonina proved she is the legitimate daughter of a deceased Japanese father and a Filipina mother. Upon reaching the age of majority, she elected Philippine citizenship. She sought to use her mother’s surname ("Bartolome") because her siblings were already doing so, and she felt embarrassed using a Japanese surname due to lingering post-war ill-feelings among Filipinos against the Japanese. The CFI granted the petition. The Republic appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction and the sufficiency of the reasons for the name change.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the petition was not verified.
2. W/N there is sufficient reason to justify the change of surname from the father's to the mother's.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The requirement regarding verification of a pleading is a formal, not a jurisdictional, requisite. It is intended simply to ensure good faith and the veracity of allegations. Non-compliance does not render the pleading fatally defective; the court may order its correction or act on it if the ends of justice so require. Although the petition was not verified under Section 6, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, it was subscribed and sworn to. Therefore, the defect did not deprive the court of jurisdiction (*Miller v. Director of Lands*).

2. **YES.** While Article 364 of the Civil Code provides that legitimate children shall principally use the surname of the father, Article 264 of the same Code allows them to bear the surname of the mother. Consequently, a court may authorize a change of surname for sufficient reason. The Court found that Antonina's desire to adopt a Filipino surname to erase signs of a former alien nationality which hampered her social life, coupled with the absence of any fraudulent intent or prejudice to the public, constituted proper and reasonable cause (*Uy v. Republic*).

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
