I. CAPTION
FLORA QUINGWA v. ARMANDO PUNO, Administrative Case No. 389, February 28, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Flora Quingwa, a public school teacher, filed a complaint for disbarment against respondent Atty. Armando Puno charging him with gross immorality and misconduct [1, 2]. On June 1, 1958, Puno took Quingwa to the Silver Moon Hotel, registered them as "Mr. and Mrs. A. Puno," and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her two times by promising that he would marry her [2, 3]. Quingwa submitted to Puno not out of lust but due to his promise of marriage [4]. Puno later left for Zamboanga City and refused to answer Quingwa's letters regarding her pregnancy [2]. On February 20, 1959, Quingwa gave birth to a baby boy [5]. Puno denied the charges and disowned the child, but failed to present evidence to support his defense during the Solicitor General's investigation, which the Court deemed a waiver of his right to present such evidence [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N respondent Armando Puno should be disbarred for gross immorality.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that Puno committed a grossly immoral act and violated the fundamental ethics of the profession [8]. Good moral character is a condition precedent to admission to the Bar and is essential for the continued practice of law [9, 10]. When a lawyer's integrity is challenged, it is not enough to deny charges; he must show proof that he maintains the highest degree of morality [10, 11].

The Court rejected Puno's defense that the acts did not constitute grounds for disbarment under the old Rules of Court. The statutory enumeration of grounds for disbarment is not a limitation on the Court's inherent power to discipline its officers for gross misconduct that renders them unfit for the office [12-14]. Furthermore, "grossly immoral conduct" is now explicitly a ground for disbarment under Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court [8, 12]. Puno's act of having carnal knowledge with the complainant through a promise of marriage constitutes conduct devoid of the highest degree of morality and integrity expected of members of the Bar [10, 15].

Respondent Armando Puno is disbarred and his name is ordered stricken off from the Roll of Attorneys [16].
