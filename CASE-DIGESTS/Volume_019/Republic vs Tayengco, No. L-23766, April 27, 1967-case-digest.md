I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSE C. TAYENGCO and ALICIA SCHMID-ECHOLS, G.R. No. L-23766, April 27, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 17, 1957, the Republic filed a complaint for the expropriation of parcels of land owned by Tayengco and Schmid-Echols for the widening of the Iloilo South Road and simultaneously took possession of the properties [1]. Nine months later, on January 17, 1958, the Republic deposited P12,149.22 with the City Treasurer, which the defendants were authorized to withdraw on January 25, 1958 [2, 3].

The Court of First Instance of Iloilo valued the properties at P35.00 per square meter [2]. It ordered the Republic to pay Tayengco P4,360.30 and Schmid-Echols P20,652.80, with 6% interest per annum from April 17, 1957 (date of taking), crediting the deposited amounts as partial payments [2]. The Republic moved for reconsideration, arguing that pursuant to *Republic v. Lara*, interest should only be imposed on the balance of the award after deducting the P12,149.22 deposit [4]. The motion was denied, and the case was certified to the Supreme Court as a question of law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic is liable for legal interest on the amount deposited from the date of taking possession until the date of the deposit.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Owners of expropriated lands are entitled to recover interest from the date the condemnor takes possession of the lands, and the amounts granted by the court shall cease to earn interest only from the moment they are paid to the owners or deposited in court [5, 6].

The Court distinguished this case from *Republic v. Lara*, noting that in *Lara*, the deposit was made at the commencement of proceedings [3]. Here, the Republic deposited the amount nine months after taking possession [3]. Applying the doctrine in *Philippine Railway Co. v. Solon* and *Capitol Subdivision, Inc. v. Province of Negros Occidental*, interest accrues from the time of taking [6]. Therefore, the full awards earn interest from April 17, 1957, but the specific amount deposited (P12,149.22) ceases to earn interest as of the date of its deposit on January 17, 1958 [6].

The appealed decision is affirmed [7].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion, C.J., Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred [7].
