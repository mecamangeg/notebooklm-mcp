**I. CAPTION**
ESTEFANIA VDA. DE MIRANDA, ET AL. v. HON. MACAPANTON ABBAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20570, January 27, 1967, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1956, the Heirs of Campa-an filed a complaint against Sebastian Miranda in the Court of First Instance of Davao to recover ownership of a parcel of land. After 17 postponements over four years, the hearing was set for September 30, 1960. Counsel for the plaintiffs appeared, but neither Miranda nor his counsel was present despite due notice. After waiting two hours, the trial judge allowed the plaintiffs to present evidence *ex parte*.

On December 21, 1960, the trial court rendered judgment ordering Miranda to vacate the land and pay damages. Miranda died on February 21, 1961. The court was informed of his death on July 26, 1961. A writ of execution was issued on August 11, 1961, and the entry of judgment was physically made on August 16, 1961. The court ordered the writ enforced against Miranda's heirs (petitioners herein). The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the trial court abused its discretion regarding the hearing and that the writ was void under Rule 39.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing the plaintiffs to introduce evidence *ex parte* without reserving the defendant's right to present evidence later.
2. W/N the writ of execution was void because the defendant died before the entry of judgment.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The trial judge did not abuse his discretion. Continuances are addressed to the sound discretion of the court and will not be disturbed absent patent abuse. Here, the defendant's counsel was duly notified but failed to appear. The Court ruled that the trial court was not obligated to reserve the right to present evidence, as the "failure of defendant to be present at the hearing" has the effect of "depriving him of his right to present evidence" (Santiago vs. Conde) [1-3].

2. **NO.** The writ of execution is valid. While Section 7, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court mentions execution when a party dies *after* entry of judgment, it cannot be construed to invalidate a writ if the party dies *before* entry but after the judgment was rendered. The rule merely indicates against whom the writ is to be enforced (the executor, administrator, or successor-in-interest). Nothing in the rules intimates that a writ issued under these circumstances is a nullity. Furthermore, the issuance of the writ five days before the physical entry of judgment was deemed a non-prejudicial error [4, 5].

Petition denied [5].
