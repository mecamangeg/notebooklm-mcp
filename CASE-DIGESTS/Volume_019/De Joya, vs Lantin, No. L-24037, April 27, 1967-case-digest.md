I. CAPTION
ALBERTO DE JOYA, as Commissioner of Customs and MATIAS ANTOLIN, as Collector of Customs for the North Harbor v. HON. GREGORIO T. LANTIN, as Presiding Judge, Branch VII, Court of First Instance of Manila and FRANCINDY COMMERCIAL, G.R. No. L-24037, April 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Francindy Commercial purchased 90 bales of textiles declared as "rayon rags" from Ernerose Commercial in Cebu. Upon the shipment's arrival at the North Harbor in Manila in October 1964, Customs authorities held the goods for verification and discovered they differed from the declaration in the cargo manifest [1, 2]. The goods were effectively seized on October 6, 1964 [3]. On October 26, 1964, Francindy Commercial filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [3]. Subsequently, on November 12, 1964, the Collector of Customs issued a formal Warrant of Seizure and Detention [4]. The Commissioner of Customs moved to dismiss the CFI case for lack of jurisdiction, but Judge Lantin held the motion in abeyance and issued a mandatory injunction ordering the release of the goods [4, 5]. The petitioners filed this action for certiorari and prohibition to stop the CFI from assuming jurisdiction [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to entertain a petition regarding the seizure and detention of imported goods.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the Bureau of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) have exclusive jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings. Under Section 602 of Republic Act No. 1937 (Tariff and Customs Code), the Bureau of Customs is empowered to enforce tariff and customs laws and prevent smuggling [6].

The Court held that Republic Acts 1937 and 1125 are special laws that vest exclusive jurisdiction over these matters in the Bureau of Customs and the CTA. As special laws and later enactments, they prevail over the Judiciary Act, which is a general law defining the jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance [7]. To allow recourse to the CFI would render the power of Customs authorities ineffective and deprive the CTA of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction (*Pacis v. Averia*) [7]. Even though Francindy filed the CFI petition before the formal warrant of seizure was issued, the goods were already under actual seizure by Customs at the time [3].

The petition filed by Francindy Commercial in the Court of First Instance is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and the preliminary injunction against the respondents is made permanent [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
