I. CAPTION
RED LINE TRANSPORTATION CO., INC., ET AL. v. MATIAS SANTO TOMAS, G.R. No. L-18584, January 30, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Matias Santo Tomas applied with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate a bus service on the Imurung-Baggao-Tuguegarao line using eight units. Petitioners Red Line Transportation Co., Inc. and other operators opposed the application, arguing that the existing service was sufficient and that the new service would lead to ruinous competition [1], [2]. The PSC granted authority for four units, finding that the approval would promote public interest as the current transportation means were inadequate to meet the needs of the constant flow of passengers, often resulting in overloading and long wait times [2], [3], [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the PSC's findings regarding public necessity and the respondent's financial capacity [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the PSC's finding of public necessity and convenience is supported by evidence.
2. W/N the respondent is financially capable of operating the service.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the PSC's conclusion, ruling that where the Commission has weighed conflicting evidence and found that public necessity warrants additional service, such conclusion must be respected unless unsupported by evidence [5]. The record amply showed that students, employees, and merchants traveling the route faced inadequate transportation options, with buses frequently fully loaded or overloaded [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the issue of financial capacity was academic because the respondent had already purchased the four buses and was actually operating them [6]. Furthermore, the evidence supported his capacity, showing he possessed significant assets, including a store, cash deposits, and valuable agricultural and residential land, sufficient to meet the financial responsibilities of the service [6], [7].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed [7].
