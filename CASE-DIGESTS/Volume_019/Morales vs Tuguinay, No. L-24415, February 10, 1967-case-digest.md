I. CAPTION
ANDRES MORALES v. MANUEL TUGUINAY, G.R. No. L-24415, February 10, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections, Manuel Tuguinay was proclaimed Mayor of Banaue, Ifugao [1]. Andres Morales filed an election protest, and the Court of First Instance subsequently declared Morales the winner with 642 votes against Tuguinay's 639 [1]. Within two days of the decision, Tuguinay filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the subject heading "Consistency and Delicacy," arguing that certain ballots bearing the letter "H" (referring to his native name "Hucka") should have been counted in his favor [1, 2]. The trial court denied the motion. Tuguinay filed a notice of appeal, but Morales moved to dismiss it, arguing that Tuguinay’s motion was *pro forma* because it was not based on grounds specified in Rules 37 and 38 of the Rules of Court, and thus did not interrupt the 5-day period for appeal under Section 178 of the Revised Election Code [3]. The trial court refused to dismiss the appeal, prompting Morales to appeal directly to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent's Motion for Reconsideration was *pro forma*.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the motion was not *pro forma*. Although the epigraph or title of the motion was "Consistency and Delicacy," the body of the motion explicitly argued that the decision was not justified by the evidence, which is a valid ground under Rule 37, Section 1(c) of the Rules of Court [4]. The motion cited specific transcripts and evidence regarding the respondent's nickname "Hucka" to support the validity of rejected ballots [2]. The Court ruled that "the epigraph should yield to the contents of the motion... as substance should prevail over form," citing *Jornales vs. Central de Bais* [4]. Consequently, the motion validly interrupted the period for appeal.

The order of the lower court refusing to dismiss the appeal is AFFIRMED [5].
