I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FELIPE CRUZ, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-20797, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Vicente Aquino y Perez and Felipe Cruz, Jr. were charged in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan with violating Section 174 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). On June 28, 1960, they were found in possession of 39 cases and 38 cartons of "Union Blue Seal" cigarettes, subject to specific taxes of at least P10,444.00 which had not been paid [1]. While co-accused Cruz moved for reinvestigation, Aquino withdrew his initial plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to the charge [2]. The trial court sentenced Aquino to six months imprisonment and a fine of P5,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency [2]. Aquino appealed, contending that the penalty was excessive and not in accordance with law, arguing that only a fine should have been imposed given his plea of guilt [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the penalty of six months imprisonment and a P5,000.00 fine is excessive and contrary to law considering the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The penalty is valid. The Supreme Court held that even if the appellant is granted the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty, the sentence remains within the lawful range prescribed by the Tax Code [2]. Section 174 of the NIRC provides that possession of articles subject to unpaid specific tax shall be punished by a fine of not less than three times the tax due (capped at P5,000) *or* by imprisonment of four months and one day to four years and two months, *or both* [3]. Since the law expressly allows for the imposition of both imprisonment and a fine ("or both"), the lower court's sentence was proper [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [4].
