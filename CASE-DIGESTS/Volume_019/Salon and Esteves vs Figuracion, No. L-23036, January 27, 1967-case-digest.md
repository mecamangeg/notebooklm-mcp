I. CAPTION
BEATRIZ SALON and PERFECTO ESTEVES v. FORTUNATA FIGURACION and her husband, G.R. No. L-23036, January 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Beatriz Salon and Perfecto Esteves filed an action for damages based on defamatory imputations against Defendants Fortunata Figuracion and her husband in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pangasinan [1]. In their amended complaint filed on February 17, 1961, the plaintiffs demanded P10,000.00 in moral damages and P1,000.00 in attorney’s fees [2].

Subsequently, Republic Act No. 3828 took effect on June 22, 1963, amending the Judiciary Act to increase the exclusive original jurisdiction of municipal courts to civil actions where the demand does not exceed P10,000.00, exclusive of interests and costs [2]. The defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the CFI had lost jurisdiction because the claim for damages was exactly P10,000.00 [3]. The CFI dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, prompting the plaintiffs to appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the complaint involving a demand for P10,000.00 moral damages and P1,000.00 attorney's fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the aggregate amount of the demand, which must include attorney's fees [4]. Under established jurisprudence (*Carlos v. P.J. Kiener Construction, Ltd.*, *Rosario v. Justice of the Peace*, *Suanes v. Almeda-Lopez*) and Section 88 of Republic Act No. 296, the only items excluded from the jurisdictional amount are costs and interest [4].

In this case, the total demand consists of P10,000.00 in moral damages plus P1,000.00 in attorney's fees, amounting to P11,000.00 [4]. Since this total exceeds the P10,000.00 jurisdictional limit of the municipal courts under Republic Act No. 3828, the case falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance [4].

The Order of dismissal is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
