I. CAPTION
ASSOCIATED LABOR UNION v. JUDGE AMADOR E. GOMEZ, JUDGE JOSE C. BORROMEO and SUPERIOR GAS AND EQUIPMENT CO. OF CEBU, INC., G.R. No. L-25999, February 9, 1967, 19 SCRA 305, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Associated Labor Union (Union) and Superior Gas and Equipment Co. of Cebu (Sugeco) were negotiating the renewal of their collective bargaining agreement which expired on January 1, 1966 [1]. Negotiations collapsed in February 1966 when 12 employees resigned from the Union, allegedly due to Sugeco's coercion [1, 2]. On March 1, the Union charged Sugeco with unfair labor practice (ULP) for bargaining in bad faith and campaigning for union resignations [3]. On March 4, the Union declared a strike and picketed Sugeco's Basak plant [4].

The following day, March 5, Sugeco filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu (Case No. R-9221) to restrain the picketing and claim damages [4]. Respondent Judge Gomez issued an *ex parte* writ of preliminary injunction [5]. The Union moved for reconsideration, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction due to the subject matter being a ULP case, but Judge Borromeo denied it [5]. Simultaneously, the Union filed a formal ULP charge against Sugeco in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2]. The Union then filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition to annul the CFI's injunction [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction against picketing in a case involving an unfair labor practice charge.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance (CFI) has no jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that the acts alleged—coercion and cajolery of employees to resign from or join a union—constitute unfair labor practices (ULP) under Section 4(a) and (b) of the Industrial Peace Act [7, 8].

Under Section 5(a) of the Industrial Peace Act, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has *exclusive* jurisdiction over the prevention of unfair labor practices [9]. This jurisdiction covers the authority to issue injunctions related to the dispute. The Court held that Sugeco's claim for damages in the CFI does not defeat the CIR's exclusive jurisdiction because the right to damages depends on the evidence presented in the ULP case [10]. To allow the CFI to entertain the injunction would sanction "split jurisdiction," which is obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice [10]. Furthermore, the ULP charge filed in the CIR was not an afterthought to divest the CFI of jurisdiction, as it was filed on the same day as the CFI complaint [11]. Thus, the injunction issued by the CFI was *coram non judice* and void [12].

Petition granted; the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the CFI is declared null and void, and the respondent judges are directed to dismiss Case No. R-9221 [13].
