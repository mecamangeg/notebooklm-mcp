I. CAPTION
MANUEL BERNABE v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. NICASIO YATCO, and RESURRECCION S. REYES, G.R. No. L-18278, March 30, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Resurreccion S. Reyes filed a complaint against Manuel Bernabe for the acknowledgment of her minor child, support, and damages. Bernabe failed to appear at the hearing despite notice, as his motion for postponement was denied. Consequently, the trial court rendered a decision on October 28, 1960, ordering Bernabe to acknowledge the child and pay support [1].

Bernabe received the decision on November 7, 1960. On November 12, 1960, he filed a "motion to set aside decision and/or for new trial," which was denied on November 25, 1960. Instead of appealing immediately, Bernabe filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) of the denial order on December 5, 1960, citing the same grounds. This MR was denied on December 10, 1960. He finally filed his notice of appeal on January 3, 1961 [2].

The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed Bernabe’s petition for mandamus to compel the trial court to give due course to the appeal. The CA ruled that the judgment had become final and executory because the MR of the order denying the new trial did not suspend the 30-day appeal period, resulting in a total lapse of 43 days [2, 3]. Bernabe argued that he was appealing the orders denying his motions, which he claimed were final orders akin to a petition for relief under Rule 38 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order denying the motion to set aside the decision and/or for new trial is appealable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal, holding that the proper remedy was to appeal the judgment itself, not the order denying the new trial.

The Court distinguished between a motion for new trial under Rule 37 and a petition for relief under Rule 38. Relief under Rule 38 applies only when a judgment has become final and executory and a new trial is unavailable [5]. Since Bernabe filed his motion before the judgment became final, it was a motion for new trial under Rule 37 [5]. An order denying a motion for new trial under Rule 37 is interlocutory and unappealable; the remedy is to appeal from the judgment and assign the denial as an error [6, 7].

Furthermore, the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration of the order denying the new trial did not suspend the period for perfecting an appeal because it alleged the same grounds stated in the motion for new trial [2, 8, 9]. Consequently, the judgment became final and executory before the appeal was perfected.

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
