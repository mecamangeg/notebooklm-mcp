I. CAPTION
LIM SIH BENG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-23387, April 24, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lim Sih Beng, a Chinese citizen and manager of Long Life & Grocery in Legaspi City, filed a petition for naturalization on August 29, 1961. In his petition, he failed to state that he resided in Barrio Palaypay, Pilar, Sorsogon, from 1941 to 1945. He also listed his other residences in Fukien, China, and various cities in the Philippines in general terms without specific addresses. Regarding his finances, his income tax returns from 1959 to 1961 showed an average annual net income of P8,830.24 (approx. P735.85 monthly), with five of his seven children dependent on him for support. The Court of First Instance of Albay granted his petition, declaring he possessed all qualifications. The Republic appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's failure to state all former places of residence is fatal to his petition.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The omission is fatal. Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires a petition for naturalization to state not only the present residence but also *all other* places where the petitioner formerly resided. Lim Sih Beng admitted failing to list his residence in Sorsogon from 1941 to 1945. Furthermore, providing addresses in "bare general terms" (e.g., just the city name) does not satisfy the law, as an address must describe a place where a person may be found. These omissions deprive the government of the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation into the petitioner's activities and fitness for citizenship.

2. **NO.** The petitioner's income is not considered lucrative. With an average monthly net income of P735.85 and five dependent children, the per capita monthly income for the family members is only P105.12. Citing *Keng Giok vs. Republic*, the Court held that such an amount is insufficient considering the high cost of living and the low purchasing power of the peso.

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is REVERSED and the petition for naturalization is DENIED.
