I. CAPTION
AUYONG HIAN (HONG WHUA HANG) v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, and COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-25181, January 11, 1967, 19 SCRA 10, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Auyong Hian imported 600 hogsheads of Virginia leaf tobacco which arrived in the Philippines on December 30, 1961, based on licenses issued just prior to the expiration of the Import Control Law in 1953 [1]. The Collector of Customs seized the shipment (Seizure Identification No. 6669) and declared it forfeited to the government, ordering its sale [2]. Petitioner appealed to the Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed the Collector’s decision [3].

Prior to this administrative appeal, the Supreme Court, in the related cases of *Climaco v. Barcelona* and *Collector of Customs v. Arca*, had declared the Court of First Instance without jurisdiction to release the tobacco and incidentally characterized the importation as illegal [4, 5]. When Auyong Hian appealed the Commissioner's decision to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), the CTA dismissed the petition [6]. The CTA reasoned that it lacked jurisdiction because the Supreme Court had already declared the importation illegal in the previous cases, and it could not review or overrule the Supreme Court [6]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the CTA had jurisdiction to resolve issues regarding the specific nature of the illegality (relative vs. absolute) and the legality of the seizure and sale [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to review the decision of the Commissioner of Customs despite the Supreme Court's previous declaration in related cases that the importation was illegal.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commissioner of Customs in cases involving seizures, forfeitures, and other matters arising under the Customs Law, pursuant to Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 and Sections 2313 and 2402 of the Tariff and Customs Code [8-11].

The Supreme Court held that its previous declarations of illegality in *Climaco* and *Arca* were made to resolve the issue of the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance over goods in customs custody [12, 13]. The Court explicitly stated in *Arca* that it would "refrain from passing upon the administrative proceedings" pending before the customs authorities and recognized that the CTA had acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter upon Auyong Hian’s appeal [14, 15]. The administrative appeal raised specific issues—such as whether the goods were subject to redemption (relatively prohibited) or not (absolutely prohibited), and the validity of the order of sale—which were not decided by the Supreme Court and required a ruling from the CTA [12, 16].

The resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals are **SET ASIDE**, and the case is **REMANDED** for further proceedings [17].
