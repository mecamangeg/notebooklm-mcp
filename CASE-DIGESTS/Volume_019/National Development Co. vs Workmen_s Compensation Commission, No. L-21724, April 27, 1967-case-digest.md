I. CAPTION
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and GERTRUDES LUCAS VDA. DE RAYMUNDO, G.R. No. L-21724, April 27, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Luis Raymundo was employed by petitioner National Development Co. (NDC) for over 12 years, lastly as a machine tender. His work involved strenuous lifting, pushing heavy wagons, and mixing chemicals, often at night and under varying temperatures. Due to deteriorating health, Raymundo retired on May 6, 1953. Eight months later, on January 23, 1954, he died of pulmonary tuberculosis. On April 27, 1960, his widow, respondent Gertrudes Lucas Vda. de Raymundo, filed a claim for workmen’s compensation [1].

NDC denied liability, arguing that: (1) the claim was barred by prescription as it was filed years after the three-month statutory period; (2) the evidence presented (the widow's testimony and medical documents) was inadmissible as self-serving or hearsay; and (3) TB was not an occupational disease contracted during employment [2]. The Regional Office ruled in favor of the widow, awarding death compensation and burial expenses. The Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) affirmed the decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the evidence presented by the respondent (widow's testimony and hearsay documents) is admissible.
2. W/N death benefits are recoverable for an illness that was merely aggravated by, but not contracted during, employment.
3. W/N the claim is barred by prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The admission of the widow's testimony and other documents was proper. A party's interest may affect credibility but not admissibility; "self-serving evidence" refers to extrajudicial statements, not sworn testimony in court subject to cross-examination [4, 5]. Furthermore, Section 49 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act expressly allows the admission of certain hearsay evidence to simplify procedure and protect workers [6, 7].

2. **YES.** Although Section 8 of the Act mentions illness "contracted," Section 2 explicitly includes illness "aggravated by... the nature of such employment" as a ground for compensation. The Court held that the omission in Section 8 was a mere legislative oversight. Section 2 provides the grounds for compensation, while Section 8 governs the amount; therefore, Section 8 is deemed to cover cases where the illness was merely aggravated by the nature of the job [8].

3. **NO.** The petitioner cannot set up the defense of prescription for three reasons: (1) it failed to controvert the claim; (2) it paid a gratuity to the deceased under a policy for retiring employees with tuberculosis, which excuses the delay; and (3) it showed no damage resulting from the delay in filing [9].

The decision and resolution of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission are **AFFIRMED** [10].
