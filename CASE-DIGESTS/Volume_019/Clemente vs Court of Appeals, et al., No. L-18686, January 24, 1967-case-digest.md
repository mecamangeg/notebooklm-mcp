I. CAPTION
CESARIO M. CLEMENTE v. COURT OF APPEALS, THE HONORABLE MARIANO V. BENEDICTO, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF MASBATE and LOURDES PUIGCERVER, G.R. No. L-18686, January 24, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Lourdes Puigcerver owned a residential house on public land in Masbate. She leased the house to Petitioner Cesario Clemente in 1950 [1]. In 1951, they entered into a conditional sale for the house, where the balance was payable upon Clemente securing approval of his sales application for the land [1, 2]. The contract provided that if Clemente’s application was disapproved, he would pay rentals deducted from the down payment [3]. Clemente’s application was disapproved in 1951, and the land was eventually awarded to Puigcerver [4, 5].

When Clemente refused to pay rentals, Puigcerver filed an unlawful detainer case in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court. Clemente’s answer claimed ownership based on the conditional sale and argued the JP Court lacked jurisdiction due to the issue of title [6]. The JP Court ruled for Clemente, but on appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) ruled for Puigcerver, ordering ejectment and payment of back rentals [7]. The CFI ordered immediate execution because Clemente failed to file a supersedeas bond [8]. Clemente appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) but still failed to file the bond, leading the CA to also issue a writ of execution for back rentals [9]. Clemente filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court [9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court (and the CFI on appeal) had jurisdiction over the ejectment case despite the defendant raising a question of ownership.
2. W/N the lower courts committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing writs of execution pending appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The mere fact that the answer raises a question of title predicated upon a conditional sale does not deprive the Justice of the Peace Court of its jurisdiction to try the ejectment case [10]. The conditional sale became ineffective by its own terms when Clemente's sales application was disapproved [10]. Thus, the only issue was physical possession. Furthermore, there was a separate pending case between the parties involving the title, which confirmed that the ejectment case did not involve the question of ownership [11].

2. **NO.** Failure to file a supersedeas bond is a sufficient ground for the issuance of a writ of execution upon petition of the prevailing party [11]. Clemente failed to file the bond required by the CFI to stay execution under the Rules of Court [8, 11]. The denial of his belated motion to file the bond was not a grave abuse of discretion [11].

The petition is dismissed [12].
