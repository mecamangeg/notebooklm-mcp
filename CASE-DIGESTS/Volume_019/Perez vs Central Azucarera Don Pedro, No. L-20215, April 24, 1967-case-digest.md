I. CAPTION
DIONISIO PEREZ v. CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO, G.R. No. L-20215, April 24, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Dionisio Perez was employed by Central Azucarera Don Pedro from 1931 until his dismissal on January 31, 1959, for "loss of confidence." At the time of his discharge, he held the position of Chief Clerk, Supply and Warehousing. His appointments were never reduced to writing, but he was covered by the company's "Voluntary Non-Contributory Gratuity and Retirement Plan." Perez filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Batangas for reinstatement, backwages, and damages [1], [2].

The company argued that Perez was not hired for a definite period and could be separated without cause upon payment of separation pay. The CFI dismissed the complaint, ruling that Perez's employment was not for a definite term. Perez sought to amend his complaint to allege that the retirement plan created a definite term of 35 years or until age 65, but the CFI denied the amendment and the motion for reconsideration [3], [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employee was hired for a definite period based on the employer's retirement gratuity plan.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to award separation pay in this case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Perez was not hired for a definite period. Although he was a permanent employee, his appointments were never reduced to writing [6]. The "Voluntary Non-Contributory Retirement Gratuity Plan" did not fix a definite period of employment; it was merely a schedule of rates for computing retirement benefits based on length of service, age, and salary [6], [7]. Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787, in the absence of a contract for a specific period, an employer may dismiss an employee at any time with or without cause, provided the required notice or separation pay is given [7], [8], [9].

2. **YES.** While the original complaint sought reinstatement and not separation pay, the right to separation pay was inherent in the defendant's affirmative defense that Perez could be separated without cause [10]. The Court ruled that the plaintiff should be given the opportunity to prove the amount of separation pay he is entitled to if his dismissal was without just cause. This matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, not the Regional Office of the Department of Labor, citing *Stoll v. Mardo* [10].

**The Order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED for trial to determine if the dismissal was without cause and the amount of separation pay due [11].**
