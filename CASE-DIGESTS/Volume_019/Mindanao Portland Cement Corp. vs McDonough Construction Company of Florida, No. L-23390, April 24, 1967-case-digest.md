I. CAPTION
MINDANAO PORTLAND CEMENT CORPORATION v. MCDONOUGH CONSTRUCTION COMPANY OF FLORIDA, G.R. No. L-23390, April 24, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mindanao Portland Cement and respondent McDonough Construction executed a contract on February 13, 1961, for the construction of a cement plant in Iligan City. Turnbull, Inc. was engaged as the "Engineer" to supervise the project. The project, originally set for completion in December 1961, was delayed and only finished in late 1962. Disputes arose regarding the final payment: Petitioner claimed over P2 million in damages for the delay, while respondent claimed over P400,000 for the unpaid balance and extra work. A conference to settle the matter failed.

Petitioner requested arbitration pursuant to Paragraph 39 of their contract, which mandated arbitration for disagreements on rights or obligations, *except* for questions regarding the "interpretation of plans and specifications," "sufficiency of materials," and "time, sequence and method of performing the work," which were to be finally determined by the Engineer. Respondent refused to arbitrate, arguing the dispute fell under these exceptions. Petitioner filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to compel arbitration. The CFI ordered the parties to arbitrate. Respondent appealed, arguing the dispute should be resolved by the Engineer.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the parties are duty-bound to submit their dispute to arbitration.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order.

The Court held that the dispute does not fall under the exceptions in the arbitration clause (Paragraph 39). The exceptions—interpretation of plans, sufficiency of materials, and scheduling—refer to technical matters that the Engineer must resolve immediately to ensure the progress of the work.

First, the dispute regarding the computation of the total contract price and cost of extra work is not a matter of "interpretation of plans," as the Engineer's function in that regard is limited to technical discrepancies, not financial adjustments. Second, the liability for damages due to delay beyond the final extension date is not a question of "time and sequence," as the Engineer's authority is limited to scheduling work and fixing extension periods, not determining legal liability for delays after the deadline.

Since the disagreements do not belong to the exceptions, the general rule of arbitration applies. Under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 876 (The Arbitration Law), the court correctly ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration. The Court noted that the summary proceeding to enforce arbitration is not the proper venue to judge the merits of the claims; even if a defense exists, it does not make the claim frivolous or exempt from arbitration.

Judgment affirmed.
