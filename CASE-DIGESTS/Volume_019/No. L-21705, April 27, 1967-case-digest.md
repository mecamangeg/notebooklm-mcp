**I. CAPTION**
NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY v. HON. ALFREDO CATOLICO, et al. / THE PROVINCE OF MISAMIS OCCIDENTAL v. NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY, G.R. Nos. L-21705 & L-24327, April 27, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
In 1956, the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) took over the possession, administration, and control of the Misamis and Orquieta Waterworks Systems (the Systems) pursuant to Republic Act No. 1383 [1]. On July 13, 1960, the Province of Misamis Occidental (the Province) filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 2281) to recover the Systems [1].

On April 30, 1963, the Court of First Instance, presided by Judge Alfredo Catolico, rendered a decision declaring the Province the absolute owner of the Systems and ordering NAWASA to return them, account for income, and pay P50,000 in damages and P5,000 in attorney's fees [1, 2]. Before NAWASA received a copy of the decision, the Province moved for execution pending appeal, which Judge Catolico granted on May 25, 1963 [2]. The writ was executed on May 28, 1963 [2].

NAWASA filed an urgent motion to stay execution and offered a supersedeas bond, but this was denied by the lower court (Judge Santos) on July 2, 1963 [3]. NAWASA then filed a petition for certiorari (G.R. No. L-21705) challenging the execution orders and appealed the main decision (G.R. No. L-24327) [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the execution pending appeal was valid despite the alleged lack of prior notice of the decision to NAWASA.
2. W/N the lower court abused its discretion in denying NAWASA’s offer of a supersedeas bond to stay execution.
3. W/N Republic Act No. 1383 is constitutional insofar as it transfers ownership of local waterworks to NAWASA.
4. W/N the award of damages and attorney's fees against NAWASA was proper.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** There is no legal provision barring the execution of a decision, which is not yet final, before notice thereof has been served upon the judgment debtor [5]. Furthermore, NAWASA's counsel had actual knowledge of the motion for execution and the opportunity to object to it, as evidenced by their written opposition and presence at the hearing [5].

2. **NO.** A judgment debtor is not entitled to a suspension of execution pending appeal as a matter of right upon the filing of a supersedeas bond; the court is merely empowered to order it in the exercise of sound discretion [6]. Since the unconstitutionality of RA 1383 was already settled jurisprudence, NAWASA's appeal regarding ownership and possession could not prosper and was merely dilatory, justifying the refusal to suspend execution [6].

3. **NO.** The Court reiterated its previous rulings (*Baguio v. NAWASA*, *Cebu v. NAWASA*, etc.) that RA 1383 is unconstitutional insofar as it makes NAWASA the owner of all local waterworks systems [7]. This constitutes a taking of private property without just compensation and due process of law [7].

4. **NO.** The award of P50,000 in exemplary/temperate damages and P5,000 in attorney’s fees was unjustified [8, 9]. NAWASA took over the Systems in compliance with RA 1383, which it was entitled to assume was constitutional at the time [9]. Thus, NAWASA acted in good faith [9].

Accordingly, the petition in G.R. No. L-21705 is DENIED. The decision in G.R. No. L-24327 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award for damages and attorney's fees is eliminated [9].
