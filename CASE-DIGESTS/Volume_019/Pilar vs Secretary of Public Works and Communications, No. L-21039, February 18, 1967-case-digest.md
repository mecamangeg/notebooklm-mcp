I. CAPTION
FLORENTINO PILAR v. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, COMMISSIONER OF CIVIL SERVICE, HON. AMELITO R. MUTUC, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21039, February 18, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Florentino Pilar was the Assistant of the Radio Control Division and occasionally served as its Acting Chief. In 1962, the Office of the President declared the positions of Chief and Assistant Chief as primarily confidential and highly technical. Subsequently, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications appointed Roberto San Andres as the new Chief of the Radio Control Division. Pilar protested the appointment, but the Commissioner of Civil Service approved it. Without filing a motion for reconsideration or appealing the Commissioner's decision to higher administrative authorities, Pilar filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila. The lower court rendered judgment against him.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition is barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's order. The Supreme Court held that Pilar's failure to exhaust administrative remedies was fatal to his case. After his protest against San Andres' appointment was overruled by the Commissioner of Civil Service, he failed to move for a reconsideration or appeal the decision to the proper authorities before seeking judicial intervention (*Pineda vs. Court of First Instance of Davao*).

Furthermore, under the classified civil service, the appointing power enjoys sufficient discretion to select and appoint employees based on their fitness to perform the duties of the position (*Sec. 23, par. 2, Rep. Act No. 2260*). Since the respondent San Andres was already appointed and occupying the office, and Pilar failed to show a clear right to the same, the proper remedy would have been *quo warranto* rather than *mandamus*, had the administrative remedies been exhausted.

**Order affirmed.**
