I. CAPTION
ANTONIO K. BISNAR v. BRAULIO LAPASA, G.R. No. L-24468, February 28, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In the November 12, 1963 elections, Antonio Bisnar and Braulio Lapasa were candidates for vice-mayor of Inopacan, Leyte. The Municipal Board of Canvassers proclaimed Lapasa the winner with 1,293 votes against Bisnar’s 1,261 votes. Bisnar filed an election protest (Case No. 24-B) with the Court of First Instance of Leyte. The trial court ruled in favor of Bisnar, declaring him the duly elected vice-mayor with a plurality of 24 votes (1,250 to 1,226). Lapasa appealed directly to the Supreme Court, assigning errors to the lower court’s invalidation of 18 ballots containing only the word "Bala" (allegedly his nickname) and 50 other ballots declared as marked.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N ballots containing only the nickname "Bala" are valid votes for Lapasa.
2. W/N the specific ballots containing words like "engat", initials, or appellations of friendship are marked and void.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that under Section 149, paragraph 9 of the Revised Election Code, for a ballot containing a nickname to be counted, it must be accompanied by either the name or surname of the candidate. Furthermore, Section 34 of the same Code prohibits certificates of candidacy from containing nicknames. There was no evidence presented that "Bala" was Lapasa’s nickname, and even if it were, the vote remains invalid for lacking the accompanying name or surname. The exceptional circumstances in *Abrea v. Lloren* (where the nickname was in the certificate of candidacy and used extensively) were not present here.

2. **PARTIALLY YES AND NO.** The Court distinguished between marked ballots and stray/valid votes based on the intent to identify:
*   **Marked/Void:** Ballots containing irrelevant words like "engat" (luminous), "boy", or "Señorito" (which is not a valid prefix under Sec. 149, par. 5) were declared marked because they served no purpose other than identification, especially when appearing in patterns. Ballots with initials like "R.L." or "A.A.D." in conspicuous spaces were also invalid.
*   **Valid:** Ballots with appellations of affection (e.g., "Mahal kong," "deong"), erroneous initials accompanying a correct surname (Sec. 149, par. 6), or diagonal lines indicating desistance from voting were held valid. Nicknames written in spaces for other offices (e.g., "Cardo", "Rudy") without evidence of an intent to mark were considered stray votes but did not invalidate the ballot.

The Court adjudicated 15 additional valid ballots to Lapasa, bringing his total to 1,241. However, this was still insufficient to overcome Bisnar’s votes.

**Judgment affirmed.** Protestant-appellee Antonio K. Bisnar is declared the winner by 9 votes.
