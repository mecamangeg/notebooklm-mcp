I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE INTERNATIONAL SURETY CO., INC. v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, et al., G.R. No. L-22420, March 18, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On December 13, 1954, packages of merchandise consigned to J.D. Salva arrived in Manila but were seized by the Collector of Customs for lack of release certificates and import licenses required by Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 [2]. The goods were released after Salva posted surety bonds issued by petitioner Philippine International Surety Co., Inc. [2]. On April 20, 1955, the Collector declared the importation forfeited and ordered the payment of P4,733.00 [3].

Salva appealed to the Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed the Collector’s decision, but Salva did not appeal further [3]. Petitioner, as surety, filed a motion for reconsideration with the Commissioner, which was denied, and subsequently appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3]. The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that the Central Bank Circulars were valid and that petitioner lacked the personality to appeal as it was merely a surety [3]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing it could not have appealed the Collector's decision earlier because it was not notified of said decision [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner has the personality to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.
2. W/N Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45 are valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A party that fails to appeal the decision of the Collector of Customs to the Commissioner of Customs has no personality to appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals [1, 4]. The Court found that petitioner failed to appeal the Collector's decision to the Commissioner [4]. Regarding petitioner's claim of lack of notice, the Court applied the presumption that official duty was regularly performed under Sec. 5(m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court [5]. Records showed letters addressed to the surety dated shortly after the Collector's decision, and petitioner failed to raise the alleged lack of notice in its motion for reconsideration before the Commissioner [5, 6].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the CTA's resolution sustaining the validity of the circulars [7]. The Supreme Court reiterated a long line of decisions upholding the validity and constitutionality of Central Bank Circulars 44 and 45, citing cases such as *Commissioner of Customs v. Serree Investment Co.* and *Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading* [7].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
