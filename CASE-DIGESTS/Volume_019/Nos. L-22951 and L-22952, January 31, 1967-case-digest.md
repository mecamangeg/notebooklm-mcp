I. CAPTION
ALLIED FREE WORKERS' UNION (PLUM) v. COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, Manager JOSE C. TEVES, and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; and COMPAÑIA MARITIMA v. AFWU, et al., G.R. Nos. L-22951, L-22952, & L-22971, January 31, 1967, 19 SCRA 258, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
On August 11, 1952, Compañia Maritima (Maritima) and Allied Free Workers’ Union (AFWU) entered into an "Arrastre and Stevedoring Contract" whereby AFWU agreed to perform services for Maritima's vessels in Iligan City. The contract stipulated that Maritima would not be liable for the payment of services, which were payable by cargo owners/consignees, and that AFWU would be responsible for damage to cargoes. The parties operated under the "cabo" system, where AFWU selected, hired, paid, and supervised the laborers.

In 1953, Maritima complained of inefficient service. On July 23, 1954, AFWU proposed a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), to which Maritima did not reply. On August 24, 1954, Maritima terminated the contract effective September 1, 1954, due to inefficiency. AFWU filed cases for unfair labor practice (ULP) and certification election (Case 175-MC) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). The CIR dismissed the ULP charge, finding AFWU was an independent contractor, but ordered a certification election, reasoning that an implied employer-employee relationship existed after the contract was terminated because AFWU continued working. Both parties appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there is an employer-employee relationship between Maritima and the members of AFWU.
2. W/N Maritima committed unfair labor practice (ULP) by refusing to bargain and terminating the contract.
3. W/N a certification election is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** AFWU is an independent contractor, not an employee. Under the "cabo" system, AFWU selected and hired the laborers, paid their wages, exercised control and supervision over them, and had the power to discipline and dismiss them. These are the elements determining an employer-employee relationship (*Viaña v. Al-Lagadan*). Maritima had no control over the means and methods of the work, only the result. Even after the written contract was terminated, the parties continued the "cabo" system, which negatives employment relationship. An employer-employee relationship cannot be imposed against the will of a company (*Pampanga Bus Co. v. Pambusco Employees' Union*).

2. **NO.** The duty to bargain collectively under the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) arises only between an "employer" and its "employees." Since no such relationship existed, Maritima had no duty to bargain, and its refusal violated no right. Furthermore, the termination of the contract was validly based on inefficient service and a resolutory condition in the contract, not on union interference or discrimination.

3. **NO.** A certification election is the means to select a representative for collective bargaining. Since there is no employer-employee relationship and consequently no duty to bargain collectively, holding a certification election would be pointless.

The decision of the CIR is **MODIFIED**. The dismissal of the ULP case is affirmed, but the order for certification election is reversed and set aside.
