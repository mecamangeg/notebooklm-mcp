**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF ANG CHUN TO BE ADMITTED TO PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP: ANG CHUN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-22591, April 24, 1967, Castro, J.

**II. FACTS**
On March 21, 1960, Ang Chun filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. After trial, the court rendered judgment granting his petition. On January 7, 1963, Ang Chun filed a motion to take his oath of allegiance. However, after a due hearing on this motion, the CFI denied it on the ground that Ang Chun "does not have an adequate knowledge of English." The court found that when asked to translate "I intend to spend the rest of my life in this country" into Tagalog, he incorrectly wrote "Ang Filipinas ay parang bayan ko na" and committed numerous errors and illegible writings when asked to write simple sentences. His motion for reconsideration was denied, prompting this appeal where he questioned the lower court's authority to revisit his qualifications after the initial grant of citizenship.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the court may inquire into the qualifications of a petitioner at the hearing of the motion to take the oath of allegiance.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite language qualification to become a Filipino citizen.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** A court that initially granted a petition for naturalization is not limited at the oath-taking hearing to the specific inquiries under Section 1 of R.A. 530 (e.g., non-absence, lawful calling, no convictions). The court may inquire into "any question affecting the qualification of the applicant." The Supreme Court held that the government is not estopped from questioning a petitioner's status even after the initial hearing because a naturalization proceeding is not a judicial adversary proceeding, and the decision therein is not *res judicata*.

2. **NO.** The Supreme Court agreed with the lower court's findings that Ang Chun lacked the requisite language qualification. His inability to correctly translate and write simple sentences demonstrated a deficiency in a "working knowledge" of the English language. Under jurisprudence (*Lim Bun v. Republic*), such deficiency warrants the denial of both the motion to take the oath and the petition for naturalization itself.

**ACCORDINGLY**, the order appealed from is affirmed, and the petition for naturalization is denied.
