I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIANO AYOSO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-18762, April 27, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On July 21, 1960, accused-appellants Mariano Ayoso, et al. were charged with Illegal Cockfighting (violation of Art. 199 of the Revised Penal Code) before the Municipal Court of Bogo, Cebu, for engaging in cockfighting on a Thursday. The accused filed a motion to quash, arguing that the acts did not constitute an offense because Municipal Ordinance No. 18, Series of 1960, authorized cockfighting on Thursdays in Bogo. The Municipal Court sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint.

The prosecution appealed the dismissal to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Ordinance No. 18 *ultra vires* and void, setting aside the Municipal Court's dismissal, and ordering the case remanded for trial on the merits. The accused appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the prosecution had no right to appeal the dismissal and that the ordinance was valid under Republic Act No. 938.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the prosecution may appeal the Municipal Court's order dismissing the complaint upon a motion to quash.
2. W/N the municipal ordinance authorizing cockfighting on Thursdays is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The prosecution may appeal from the order of the inferior court dismissing the complaint upon a motion to quash filed before arraignment. Under Rule 122, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, the prosecution may appeal if the accused would not be placed in double jeopardy. Since the dismissal occurred before arraignment, the accused was not in jeopardy, and the appeal involved only the validity of the dismissal order, not the guilt or innocence of the accused [1-3].

2. **NO.** The ordinance is *ultra vires* and void. The Court, citing *Quimsing v. Lachica*, held that Republic Act No. 938, which allows local governments to regulate the establishment of "cockpits," did not repeal Sections 2285 and 2286 of the Revised Administrative Code regarding the regulation of "cockfighting." The power to regulate the place (cockpits) is distinct from the power to regulate the activity (cockfighting). Consequently, a municipal council cannot authorize cockfighting on days not permitted by national law, such as Thursdays [4-6].

Decision affirmed.
