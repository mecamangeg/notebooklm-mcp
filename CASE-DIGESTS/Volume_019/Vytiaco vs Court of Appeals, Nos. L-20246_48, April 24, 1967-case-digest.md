I. CAPTION
JORGE VYTIACO v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-20246–48, April 24, 1967, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On March 12, 1959, in Aborlan, Palawan, petitioner Jorge Vytiaco had an altercation with Rosalino Jagmis. When Vytiaco fled, he was pursued by Jagmis and Esteban Gapilango, a Philippine Constabulary (PC) soldier in civilian clothes. A struggle ensued where Vytiaco wrested Gapilango's service pistol. While retreating, Vytiaco pointed the gun at his pursuers to prevent them from advancing. Gapilango identified himself as a PC soldier and demanded the gun's return, but Vytiaco refused, fearing for his safety. Later, Sgt. Buñag arrived and demanded the gun, allegedly using unnecessary violence; Vytiaco again refused but eventually surrendered the firearm to the Vice Mayor.

The Court of First Instance of Palawan convicted Vytiaco of Grave Threats, Assault Upon an Agent of a Person in Authority, and Disobedience. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) acquitted him of Grave Threats and Disobedience but convicted him of Resistance and Serious Disobedience (modifying the original Assault charge) for his refusal to return the gun to Gapilango and Buñag. Vytiaco petitioned the Supreme Court to review this conviction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Vytiaco is guilty of resistance and serious disobedience to an agent of a person in authority.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted Vytiaco. The Court ruled that for a person to be held guilty of resistance or disobedience, it must be shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew the person he disobeyed was an agent of a person in authority engaged in the performance of official duties.

Here, Vytiaco did not know Gapilango was a peace officer during the struggle as Gapilango was in plainclothes. Although Gapilango identified himself later, Vytiaco's refusal to return the gun was interpreted as an act of self-protection rather than defiance of authority, as he reasonably feared Gapilango would use the weapon against him. Regarding the refusal to surrender the gun to Sgt. Buñag, the Court accepted the defense that the officer used unnecessary force, justifying Vytiaco's refusal. Any doubt regarding the intention to resist authority must be resolved in favor of the accused.

**Petition granted. Decision reversed.**
