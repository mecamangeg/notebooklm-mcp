I. CAPTION
NEW ZEALAND INSURANCE CO., LTD. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22500, April 24, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
On June 16, 1961, the vessel S/S "Tensei Maru" arrived in Manila and discharged a shipment of eight cases of plain irons into the custody of the arrastre operator, Manila Port Service. The last package was discharged on the same day [1]. The consignee, J.R. De Santos and Company, Inc., took delivery of the cargo on July 7, 1961, at which point it discovered that one case was missing [2]. Five days later, on July 12, 1961, the consignee filed a provisional claim with the Manila Port Service [3]. New Zealand Insurance Co., Ltd., the insurer, paid the consignee for the loss and, as subrogee, filed suit [4]. The lower courts ruled in favor of New Zealand Insurance [5]. Manila Port Service appealed, arguing it should be released from liability under Section 15 of the Management Contract because the claim was not filed within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package (June 16) [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the claim for the lost cargo is barred by the failure to file it within 15 days from the date of discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. While the general rule under Section 15 of the Management Contract requires claims to be filed within 15 days from the discharge of the last package, this rule applies where the consignee has knowledge of the loss before the expiration of said period [7]. An exception applies when the consignee learns of the loss only after the 15-day period has lapsed. In such cases, the period to file a claim commences from the date the claimant actually learns of the loss or damage [8]. Here, the consignee discovered the loss upon delivery on July 7, 1961, and filed the claim on July 12, 1961, well within 15 days of knowledge. The Court held that a literal application of the contract would be unfair, as it would allow the arrastre contractor to escape liability by simply withholding knowledge of the loss until the period expires [9].

Judgment affirmed [10].
