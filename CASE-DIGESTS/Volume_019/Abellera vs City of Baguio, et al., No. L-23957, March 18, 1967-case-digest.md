I. CAPTION
ROMAN D. ABELLERA v. THE CITY OF BAGUIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23957, March 18, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Roman D. Abellera, a cashier in the Office of the City Treasurer of Baguio, was charged administratively for Dishonesty and Gross Negligence after paying out forged treasury warrants and checks, causing a loss of P8,750.48 to the City [1]. On June 6, 1961, the Commissioner of Civil Service found him guilty and considered him resigned. Consequently, he was dismissed from service on July 10, 1961 [2]. Abellera appealed to the Civil Service Board of Appeals (CSBA), which modified the decision on January 25, 1963, reducing the penalty to two months suspension without pay [3].

Abellera was allowed to report for work on November 11, 1963, but was not reinstated to his former position as cashier and was not paid salaries for the period he was out of service [3]. He filed an action for mandamus for reinstatement and back salaries. The Court of First Instance of Baguio ordered the respondents to pay Abellera’s back salaries from July 10, 1961, to November 10, 1963 (deducting the two-month penalty) and to reinstate him to a position not involving the custody of funds, but denied damages [4]. Both parties appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Abellera is entitled to back salaries for the period of his separation from service pending his appeal to the CSBA.
2. W/N the City of Baguio is exempt from liability for back salaries under Section 2547 of the Revised Administrative Code.
3. W/N the approval of the Department Head is required for the payment of back salaries.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Abellera is entitled to back salaries. The Court held that his separation from service before the decision of the Civil Service Commissioner became final was "evidently premature" [5]. Since the CSBA reduced the penalty to only two months suspension, his deprivation of work from July 10, 1961, to November 10, 1963, constituted an "unjustified" suspension [5]. Under the Civil Service Law, an employee is entitled to back pay not only when found innocent but also when the suspension is unjustified [6].

2. **NO.** The City is not exempt. Section 2547 of the Revised Administrative Code exempts the City from liability for damages caused by the "failure" of officials to enforce laws or by their "negligence" [7]. The Court ruled that the unjustified dismissal was not a product of negligence or failure to act, but rather of "haste or overzeal" on the part of the city officials; thus, the exempting provision does not apply [7].

3. **NO.** The authorization of the Department Head is no longer necessary. The provisions of the Revised Administrative Code requiring such approval were superseded by Republic Act No. 2260 (Revised Civil Service Act), specifically Section 35 regarding preventive suspension [8].

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against respondents-appellants [9].
