**I. CAPTION**
LOPE DESIATA v. THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, DIRECTOR OF LANDS and CALIXTO DUQUE, G.R. No. L-21894, February 28, 1967, 19 SCRA 487, Bengzon, J.P., J.

**II. FACTS**
On October 28, 1928, respondent Calixto Duque filed a sales application with the Bureau of Lands for a parcel of land in Agusan, approximated at 77 hectares. In 1942, petitioner Lope Desiata occupied a portion of the land. A conflict arose when a 1947 survey revealed the land was actually 90 hectares, and Desiata was occupying the excess area. The Director of Lands ordered the exclusion of the excess area occupied by Desiata from Duque’s application because Duque had failed to cultivate one-fourth of the land as required by law; only 10 hectares were found to be cultivated [1], [2].

The Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources affirmed this decision on November 15, 1954. Duque's counsel received a copy of this decision on November 26, 1954 [3]. Instead of a timely appeal, Duque filed a civil suit in 1955. Later, on May 22, 1959, Duque sent a letter-petition to the President seeking to set aside the Secretary's decision, alleging lack of due process regarding the ocular inspection [4]. On July 19, 1960, the Executive Secretary, acting for the President, revoked the Secretary of Agriculture's decision and reinstated the Director’s earlier 1953 decision (which had favored Duque entirely) [5].

Desiata filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The Court of First Instance of Agusan ruled that the Executive Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion because the Secretary of Agriculture's decision had long become final [6]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Executive Secretary could validly review and revoke the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture five years after its promulgation.
2. W/N the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture was void for lack of due process due to the alleged lack of notice of the ocular inspection.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture became final and executory thirty (30) days after receipt by the interested parties, pursuant to Section 12 of Administrative Order No. 6 [7]. Since Duque's counsel received the decision on November 26, 1954, it became final on December 26, 1954 [7]. Notice to counsel is notice to the party, and counsel's failure to inform the client is not a ground to set aside a valid judgment [8]. Consequently, the Executive Secretary had no power to review the decision in 1959, nor could the President retroactively set aside the administrative order to review a decision where rights had already vested [9].

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the claim of denial of due process. Section 30 of Act No. 2874 requires a sales patent applicant to prove actual occupancy and cultivation of at least one-fourth of the land [10]. The burden of proof lies with the applicant. Furthermore, the presumption that the Bureau of Lands official performed his duty regularly during the ocular inspection cannot be overthrown by Duque's self-serving statement that he did not receive notice [11], [12]. The exclusion of the excess land was proper because the rationale of the award is beneficial use; since Duque could not cultivate the larger area, he was correctly awarded a lesser one [13].

The judgment of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [14].
