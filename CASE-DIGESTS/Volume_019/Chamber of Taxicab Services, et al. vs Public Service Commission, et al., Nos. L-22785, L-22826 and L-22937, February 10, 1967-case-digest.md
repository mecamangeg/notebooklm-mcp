**I. CAPTION**
CHAMBER OF TAXICAB SERVICES, ET AL. v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-22785, L-22826 and L-22937, February 10, 1967, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners filed an original action for certiorari alleging lack of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion against the Public Service Commission (PSC). They sought to annul the PSC order dated March 5, 1964, which granted provisional permits to 125 applicants to operate a total of 1,000 taxicab units, primarily in the City of Manila.

On September 25, 1964, respondent Jose M. Silva filed a motion to dismiss the case. He argued that on September 4, 1964, the PSC had already rendered a decision granting permanent certificates of public convenience to the respondents, confirming or increasing the units previously granted. Petitioners subsequently manifested no objection to the dismissal of specific cases related to the action.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petition for certiorari challenging the grant of provisional permits has become moot and academic.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case had become academic. The order complained of merely granted provisional permits, which were necessarily deemed superseded by the final decision rendered by the Public Service Commission on September 4, 1964, granting permanent certificates of public convenience [1, 2]. Since the provisional remedy sought to be set aside was replaced by a final decision, the petition for certiorari no longer served a practical purpose.

Petition dismissed [3].
