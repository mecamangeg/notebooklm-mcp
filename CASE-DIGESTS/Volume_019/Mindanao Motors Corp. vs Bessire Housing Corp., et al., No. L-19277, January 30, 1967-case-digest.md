I. CAPTION
MINDANAO MOTORS CORPORATION v. BESSIRE HOUSING CORPORATION and CAPITAL INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-19277, January 30, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Bessire Housing Corporation (Bessire) contracted with the Republic of the Philippines to construct pre-fabricated school buildings. In compliance with Act No. 3688, Bessire and Capital Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. (Capital Insurance) executed a surety bond for P30,000 to protect the Government and material/labor suppliers. Mindanao Motors Corporation (Mindanao Motors) rendered services and supplied materials to Bessire. After Bessire failed to pay the outstanding balance of P4,274.00 despite demands, Mindanao Motors filed a collection suit against Bessire and Capital Insurance.

Capital Insurance moved to dismiss, arguing that Mindanao Motors failed to comply with the requirements of Act No. 3688 regarding suits against penal bonds. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental denied the motion and rendered judgment ordering defendants to pay jointly and severally. Capital Insurance appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action against the surety bond should be dismissed for failure to comply with the procedural and jurisdictional requirements of Act No. 3688.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Under Act No. 3688, a supplier's right to sue on the bond is subject to specific conditions: (1) the principal contract with the Government must have been completed and settled; (2) the Government has not filed suit within six months of such final settlement (or has waived its right); and (3) notice by publication must be made to allow other creditors to intervene [1], [2].

The Court held that the suit was premature because the record failed to show the date of "performance and final settlement" of the government contract [3]. This requirement is mandatory to ensure all creditors have an equal chance to file claims and share *pro rata* if the bond is insufficient [4]. Furthermore, the requirement of notice by publication in a newspaper is jurisdictional [5]. Since it did not appear that publication was complied with, the action against the bond should have been dismissed [6].

The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the complaint is dismissed as against appellant Capital Insurance.
