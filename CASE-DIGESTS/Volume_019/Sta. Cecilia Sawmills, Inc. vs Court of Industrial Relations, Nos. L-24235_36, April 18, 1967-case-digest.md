I. CAPTION
STA. CECILIA SAWMILLS, INC., petitioner, vs. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and TAGKAWAYAN LABOR UNION, respondents., G.R. Nos. L-24235–36, April 18, 1967, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On February 29, 1964, the Supreme Court rendered a final decision in G.R. Nos. L-19273 and L-19274 ordering petitioner Sta. Cecilia Sawmills, Inc. (Company) to pay three months' back wages to 113 dismissed workers belonging to respondent Tagkawayan Labor Union (PLUM) [1]. The total computed back wages amounted to P35,263.50 [2]. Atty. Vicente A. Rafael, counsel for the Union, filed a "notice of charging liens" claiming 30% of said amount as attorney's fees [2].

On November 11, 1964, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) issued an order authorizing the Company to deduct the 30% fee for Atty. Rafael and directing it to deposit the remaining 70% with the court for future disposition [3], [4]. The Company appealed, arguing that the CIR order constituted an amendment of the final Supreme Court judgment which did not specify such deposit, and objecting that there was no proof of service of the charging lien notice to the laborers [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR order directing the deduction of fees and deposit of the balance is invalid for amending a final judgment.
2. W/N the Company can validly object to the charging lien based on lack of notice to the laborers.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The CIR order is valid. The deposit of the amount constitutes merely a part of the process of execution of the decision [5]. The Court held that decisions do not usually specify the manner of execution thereof; the manner of execution is governed by law, which, for all intents and purposes, is part of the decision itself [6], [5].

2. **NO.** The Company has no authority to represent the laborers or complain on their behalf regarding the alleged lack of notice [7]. The defense of lack of notice belongs exclusively to the laborers, not the employer [8], [5]. Furthermore, the notice was signed by the proper officers of the Union which represented the laborers, and the Company itself was furnished a copy and given the opportunity to object [5], [9].

The order and resolution appealed from are affirmed [10].
