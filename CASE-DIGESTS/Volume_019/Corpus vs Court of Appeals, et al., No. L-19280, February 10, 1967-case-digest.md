I. CAPTION
EUGENIA CORPUS v. COURT OF APPEALS, MARIANO LUDAN, FRANCISCO RAMOS and GENOVEVA ITO, G.R. No. L-19280, February 10, 1967, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Genoveva Ito, a homestead patent holder, executed an unregistered *pacto de retro* sale of her land to petitioner Eugenia Corpus in 1952. Prior to this, she had sold a portion to Jose Molina, who later transferred his interest to Corpus. On June 25, 1953, Ito sold the same land *a retro* to respondents Mariano Ludan and Francisco Ramos. Respondents, unaware of the prior unregistered conveyances, registered the sale in good faith with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. After Ito failed to redeem the property within the stipulated one-year period, respondents consolidated their title and filed an action to recover possession. The Court of First Instance declared respondents the owners but granted Ito the right to repurchase. The Court of Appeals modified the judgment, ruling that Ito had lost her right to redeem. Ito did not appeal this decision; only Corpus petitioned the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioner Corpus can claim the contract between Ito and respondents was an equitable mortgage under Art. 1602 of the Civil Code.
2. W/N petitioner Corpus has the right to redeem the homestead under Section 119 of the Public Land Act.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the petitioner cannot claim the transaction was an equitable mortgage because she was not a party to the *pacto de retro* sale between Ito and the respondents. While Ito raised this defense in the lower courts, the Court of Appeals ruled against her, declaring the transaction a valid sale. Since Ito did not appeal that decision, the issue is closed and cannot be raised by Corpus [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Corpus is not entitled to redeem the property. First, Ito herself lost the right of redemption by the final judgment of the Court of Appeals. Second, Corpus cannot claim the right under Section 119 of the Public Land Act because she is neither the "widow nor a legal heir" of the homesteader, Ito [3].

The petition is **DENIED**, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED** [4].
