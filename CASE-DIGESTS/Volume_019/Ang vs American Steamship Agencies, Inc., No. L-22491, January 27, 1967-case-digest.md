I. CAPTION
DOMINGO ANG v. AMERICAN STEAMSHIP AGENCIES, INC., G.R. No. L-22491, January 27, 1967, Bengzon, J.P., J.

II. FACTS
Yau Yue Commercial Bank agreed to sell galvanized steel sheets to Herminio Teves. The goods were shipped to Manila under a bill of lading consigned "to order of the shipper," with Teves as the notify party. Upon arrival on May 9, 1961, Teves failed to pay the demand draft, so the bank returned the bill of lading to Yau Yue. However, Teves obtained a "Permit to Deliver" from the carrier's agent, American Steamship Agencies, Inc. (respondent), by presenting a bank guarantee instead of the required original bill of lading. Consequently, Teves secured the release of the goods.

Yau Yue subsequently indorsed the bill of lading to Domingo Ang (petitioner). When Ang claimed the goods, the respondent informed him they had been delivered to Teves. On October 30, 1963, Ang filed a complaint for wrongful delivery and/or conversion. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the action had prescribed under Section 3(6), paragraph 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which sets a one-year period for suits regarding "loss or damage." The lower court dismissed the complaint on this ground.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the one-year prescriptive period under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act applies to cases of misdelivery of goods.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the one-year prescriptive period under COGSA does not apply to misdelivery.

The Court reasoned that while COGSA Section 3(6) prescribes a one-year limit for "loss or damage," the Act does not define "loss." Pursuant to Article 18 of the Civil Code, the Code's provisions supply the deficiency. Article 1189 of the Civil Code defines "loss" as when a thing perishes, goes out of commerce, or disappears such that its existence is unknown or it cannot be recovered. "Loss" contemplates a situation where no delivery at all is made because the goods are destroyed or missing. It does not include **misdelivery**, where goods are actually delivered but to the wrong person.

Citing *Tan Pho v. Hassamal Dalamal*, the Court distinguished nondelivery (loss) from misdelivery. Since the goods were delivered to Teves, they were not "lost" within the meaning of COGSA. The one-year timebar is designed for maritime hazards, which did not apply here. Instead, the applicable prescription periods are found in the Civil Code: ten years for breach of written contract or four years for quasi-delict (Arts. 1144[1] and 1146). Since Ang filed suit roughly two years after the vessel's arrival, his action had not prescribed.

The Order of dismissal was **REVERSED** and the case was **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings.
