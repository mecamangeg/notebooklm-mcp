**I. CAPTION**
EXTENSIVE ENTERPRISES CORPORATION v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22515, April 27, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On November 27, 1954, Extensive Enterprises Corporation (Petitioner) imported nine cases of rubber balloons and twelve cases of rubber nipples into the Port of Manila. The Central Bank release certificate accompanying the shipment specified only "rubber nipples." Consequently, the Bureau of Customs released the nipples but seized the rubber balloons for lacking a release certificate, in violation of Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in relation to Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code. The Collector of Customs ordered the forfeiture of the balloons. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the forfeiture. Petitioner appealed, arguing that Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were repealed by Republic Act No. 1410 and Circular No. 133, thereby abating their liability, and that the appraisal of the seized goods improperly included an estimated profit.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Central Bank Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were repealed by RA 1410 or Circular No. 133, thereby abating Petitioner's liability.
2. W/N the estimated profit of 30% should be included in the appraised value of the seized goods.
3. W/N the forfeiture of the goods was proper despite RA 265 (Central Bank Act) not explicitly prescribing forfeiture as a penalty.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were not repealed by Circular No. 133 but were incorporated into it. Furthermore, RA 1410 cannot abate liability because the violation occurred in 1954, prior to the Act's effectivity. Goods imported prior to the approval of RA 1410 are not affected by its operation [1, 2].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the appraisal of importations in connection with seizure proceedings is governed by Section 1377 of the Revised Administrative Code, which bases assessment on the value of goods "in the local market." This is distinct from appraisal for collecting duties under the Tariff Law (Sec. 1280, RAC), which uses the value in the place of importation. Therefore, including the estimated profit the merchandise would bring the importer is justified [3, 4].

3. **YES.** While RA 265 does not expressly provide for forfeiture, Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 have the force and effect of law. The importation, being in violation of these circulars, categorized the goods as "merchandise of prohibited importation" or importation effected "contrary to law." Consequently, they were the proper subject of forfeiture proceedings under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code [5].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **AFFIRMED**.

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Concepcion, Dizon, Regala, Makalintal, Bengzon, J.P., Zaldivar, Sanchez, and Castro concurred with the ruling.
