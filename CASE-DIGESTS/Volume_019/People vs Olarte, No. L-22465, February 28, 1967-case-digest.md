I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, ET AL. v. ASCENCION P. OLARTE, G.R. No. L-22465, February 28, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Ascencion P. Olarte was charged with libel for writing derogatory letters against Miss Visitacion M. Meris between February and May 1954 [1]. Meris filed a complaint with the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Pozorrubio, Pangasinan on February 22, 1956 [1]. Olarte waived preliminary investigation, and an information was filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI) on July 3, 1956 [1]. Olarte moved to quash on the ground of prescription, which the CFI granted. On appeal (G.R. No. L-13027, decided June 30, 1960), the Supreme Court reversed the dismissal, ruling that the filing of the complaint in the JP Court interrupted the prescriptive period, and remanded the case for trial [2].

While the prosecution was presenting evidence, the defense moved to quash the information again in 1963 [3]. They invoked the new Supreme Court ruling in *People v. Coquia* (June 29, 1963), which held that filing a complaint in the JP court does *not* interrupt prescription [3]. The CFI Judge granted the motion, reasoning that *Coquia* effectively abandoned the 1960 ruling in Olarte's own previous appeal [4]. The prosecution appealed this dismissal [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1960 Supreme Court decision in this case constitutes the "law of the case" which cannot be overturned by a subsequent contrary ruling in a different case (*People v. Coquia*).
2. W/N the filing of a complaint in the Municipal Court for preliminary investigation interrupts the prescription of the offense.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The 1960 ruling in G.R. No. L-13027 constitutes the **law of the case** and is binding. The Supreme Court held that whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts remain the same [6]. Judicial doctrines have only prospective operation and cannot retroactively nullify a prior final ruling in the same proceeding, even if the doctrine is subsequently changed in other cases [7]. A subsequent reinterpretation of the law may be applied to new cases, but not to an old one finally and conclusively determined [6].

2. **YES.** The Court explicitly **overruled** the doctrine in *People v. Coquia* and *People v. Del Rosario* [8]. The true doctrine is that the filing of a complaint in the Municipal Court, even if merely for purposes of preliminary examination or investigation, **interrupts the period of prescription** of the criminal responsibility [9]. This interpretation is supported by Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code, which states prescription is interrupted by the filing of the complaint, without distinguishing whether the court can try the case on the merits [9]. It would be unjust to deprive the injured party of the right to obtain vindication on account of delays not under their control [9].

The appealed order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** and reversed, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [10].
