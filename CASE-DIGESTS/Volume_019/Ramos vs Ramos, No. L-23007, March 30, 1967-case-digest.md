I. CAPTION
LAMBERTO RAMOS and CASIMIRA RAMOS v. ROSITA RAMOS and ROMEO RAMOS, G.R. No. L-23007, March 30, 1967, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Rosita and Romeo Ramos filed an action for reconveyance against Petitioners Lamberto and Casimira Ramos regarding a parcel of land in Binmaley, Pangasinan [1]. The trial court found that while the land originally belonged to Lamberto’s parents, Lamberto had agreed to hold half of it in trust for the respondents (children of his deceased brother), but breached this trust by registering the entire land in his name [2].

Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that an alleged document of partition ("Exhibit 1") proved the land was assigned exclusively to Lamberto [2, 3]. The CA affirmed the trial court’s decision, stating the findings were supported by evidence, but did not explicitly discuss or rule upon the probative value of "Exhibit 1" in its written decision [4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that the CA violated Section 33 of the Judiciary Act and the Rules of Court by failing to make complete findings of fact regarding said exhibit [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals violated the Judiciary Act by failing to make specific factual findings regarding a specific piece of evidence (Exhibit 1).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the law does not impose on the Court of Appeals the duty of stating complete findings of facts on all assigned errors, but merely on all *issues* properly raised before it [7].

By affirming the trial court's findings and giving credence to the respondents' verbal testimony, the CA necessarily implied a refusal to accord "Exhibit 1" the probative value claimed by the petitioners [7]. The appellate court is not required to expressly state that a specific exhibit does not suffice to overcome other evidence [6, 7]. Furthermore, the Court noted that on the merits, "Exhibit 1" was merely an undated tabulation of properties and did not constitute a valid deed of partition [8].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9].
