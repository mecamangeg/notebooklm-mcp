I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JIMMY CHUA YANHO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES: JIMMY CHUA YANHO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-19475, April 27, 1967, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jimmy Chua Yanho, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Manila [1, 2]. While the petitioner resided at 434 Rosario St., Manila to manage his businesses, his Filipino wife and four children lived separately at 157 D. Tuason St., Quezon City [3, 4]. Chua Yanho claimed he lived apart to exercise close supervision over his business and to avoid commuting difficulties caused by traffic, floods, and bad street conditions between Manila and Quezon City [4]. The Republic appealed, arguing that the petitioner failed to evince a sincere desire to embrace the customs, traditions, and ideals of the Filipinos [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from naturalization for living separately from his wife and children.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the petitioner's explanation for living separately was "utterly unsatisfactory" [5]. The Court held that it is strange and unusual for a husband to live apart from his family, a situation that is "contrary to, if not destructive of, one of the most important traits of the Filipino people—love of family and abiding interest and concern for its members" [5]. The Court stated that no real Filipino father would choose to live away from his family simply for business reasons or to avoid traffic, considering the short distance between Manila and Quezon City [5]. Consequently, this conduct confirmed that the petitioner has not evinced a real desire to embrace and practice Filipino customs [6]. The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [6].
