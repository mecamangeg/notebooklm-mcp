I. CAPTION
JUAN DELFIN v. COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and PATRICIO MERCED, G.R. No. L-23348, March 14, 1967, 19 SCRA 593, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Delfin was a share tenant cultivating a 3-hectare landholding in Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya. After being dispossessed of the land, he filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) on August 25, 1958, seeking reinstatement and damages. On April 16, 1964, the CAR rendered a decision ordering respondent Patricio Merced to reinstate Delfin and pay P500.00 in attorney's fees. However, the CAR declined to award damages because Delfin failed to present sufficient evidence regarding the net produce, specifically omitting proof of deductible items like threshing and reaping fees. Delfin moved for reconsideration and sought to reopen the case to present evidence on the indemnification amount, but the lower court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N damages can be awarded despite the failure to prove deductible expenses such as threshing and reaping fees.
2. W/N the case should be reopened to allow the presentation of "forgotten evidence."

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Damages may not be awarded on the basis of speculation, conjecture, or guesswork. Under Section 27(1) of Republic Act No. 1199, the measure of damages for dispossession is the extent of the landholder's participation in the harvest. To determine this participation, the net produce must be ascertained by deducting expenses from the gross produce. Since Section 32 of R.A. 1199 classifies threshing and reaping fees as deductible items, and the petitioner admitted failing to present evidence on these amounts, there is no factual basis to compute the damages [1].

2. **NO.** The reopening of a case before a decision becomes final is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. This tenancy case had been pending for over five years, and the failure to present evidence on the fees was not due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable neglect, but was merely "old forgotten evidence." The Court held that forgotten evidence is not a ground for reopening or a new trial, as allowing it would cause undue delay and make litigation intolerable [2].

The judgment of the Court of Agrarian Relations is AFFIRMED.
