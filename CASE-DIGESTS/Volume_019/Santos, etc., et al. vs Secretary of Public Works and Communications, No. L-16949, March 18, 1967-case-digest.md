I. CAPTION
ROSALINA SANTOS, ETC., ET AL. v. THE HONORABLE SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, G.R. No. L-16949, March 18, 1967, Regala, J.

II. FACTS
Upon request by Senator Rogelio de la Rosa, the Secretary of Public Works and Communications designated an investigator to look into the alleged closure of navigable creeks in Sexmoan, Pampanga, by private fishpond owners. The investigation covered two fishponds: "Mandayag" (owned by the estate of Maxima Santos Vda. de Blas, administered by Rosalina Santos) and "Paculayo" (owned by spouses Jose and Lydia Chivi).

The investigator found that the fishponds encroached on public navigable streams. Consequently, the Secretary ordered the plaintiffs to remove the constructions and restore the channels pursuant to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2056. The plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga to declare the Secretary's decision null and void. They argued that their properties were registered under the Torrens system, which cannot be collaterally attacked, and that R.A. No. 2056 was unconstitutional for being an *ex post facto* law and an undue delegation of judicial power.

The CFI ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring the Secretary's decision void and issuing a permanent injunction. The court held that the Secretary committed grave abuse of discretion by reviewing a title settled by a court and that R.A. No. 2056 could not retroactively apply to constructions made years prior. The Secretary appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiffs were required to appeal the Secretary’s decision to the President to exhaust administrative remedies.
2. W/N the Secretary of Public Works may order the removal of obstructions on land registered under the Torrens system.
3. W/N R.A. No. 2056 is unconstitutional for being an *ex post facto* law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require an appeal to the President in this case. Under the *alter ego* doctrine, the Secretary of a Department is the *alter ego* of the President. The decision of the Secretary is presumed to be that of the President unless disapproved. Therefore, an appeal to the President is not necessary before a court action may be instituted to review the Secretary’s decision (*Villena v. Sec. of the Interior*).

2. **YES.** The Secretary has the authority to investigate and clear navigable streams even within registered land. The Court held that R.A. No. 2056 does not constitute an unlawful delegation of judicial power. Furthermore, the silence of the Torrens title regarding the existence of a navigable stream does not preclude a subsequent investigation and determination of its existence by the Secretary (*Lovina v. Moreno*).

    However, regarding the weight of administrative findings:
    *   For the **"Paculayo"** fishpond, the evidence conclusively proved the existence of the Paculayo River within the enclosed property. The Secretary's order to demolish the obstruction was valid.
    *   For the **"Mandayag"** fishpond, the investigator failed to determine the exact location, width, and length of the alleged creek. Following the principle of due process, a decision must be supported by evidence (*Ang Tibay v. CIR*). Thus, the order regarding Mandayag was unsupported by substantial evidence.

3. **NO.** The constitutional prohibition against *ex post facto* laws applies only to criminal cases. The power of the Secretary under R.A. No. 2056 to demolish past illegal constructions on navigable rivers is an exercise of the state's authority to abate public nuisances, not an exercise of the coercive power of criminal law. It is merely an invocation of authority already vested in public works officials by earlier laws (Act No. 3208).

**Disposition:** The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** as to fishpond "Paculayo," and the writ of injunction therein is set aside. The decision is **AFFIRMED** with respect to fishpond "Mandayag," which is dismissed without prejudice to further reinvestigation due to lack of conclusive evidence on its location.
