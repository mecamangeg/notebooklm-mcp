I. CAPTION
LEONCIO BARRAMEDA v. CARMEN GONTANG, RODOLFO GENERAL and the HONORABLE JUDGE RAFAEL CRUZ, G.R. No. L-24110, February 18, 1967, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Leoncio Barrameda mortgaged three parcels of land in Camarines Sur to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to secure a P22,000 loan. Upon his failure to pay, DBP extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and purchased the property at the auction sale on April 23, 1962. Barrameda failed to redeem the land, leading DBP to consolidate ownership and obtain a new title (TCT 5003). DBP subsequently sold the property to respondents Carmen Gontang and Rodolfo General.

DBP filed an *ex parte* petition for a writ of possession, which was granted, and an *alias* writ was served, placing Gontang and General in possession. However, Barrameda, aided by armed men, repeatedly attempted to re-enter the land and seize the harvest. Consequently, Gontang and General filed a suit for preliminary injunction (Civil Case 5700). The trial court granted the injunction to enjoin Barrameda from disturbing the respondents' possession. Barrameda filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the judge acted without jurisdiction regarding the writ of possession as he was not made a party to the *ex parte* petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the writ of possession against the petitioner.
2. W/N the issuance of the preliminary injunction against the petitioner was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The purchaser of mortgaged property in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale may ask the court for a writ of possession under Section 7 of Act 3135. Upon consolidation of title, ownership is transferred to the purchaser, and they are entitled to the aid of the court in effecting delivery of possession. The Court held that a writ of possession is a necessary remedy to put an end to litigation and no independent action is necessary when the mortgagor continues in possession after confirmation of the sale (*Rivera vs. Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija*). Furthermore, the *alias* writ explicitly commanded the ejectment of adverse occupants, specifically naming Leoncio Barrameda, who was duly served.

2. **YES.** An injunction is a legitimate remedy to protect the owner of the land, being in possession, from illegitimate acts of repeated intrusion by a stranger. Citing *Rustia vs. Franco* and Pomeroy's *Equity Jurisprudence*, the Court ruled that the intermittent nature of such intrusions and the probability of their repetition justify the equitable remedy of injunction, as an independent action to try title would be inadequate.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
