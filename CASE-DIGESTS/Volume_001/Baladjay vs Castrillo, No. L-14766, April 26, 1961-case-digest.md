I. CAPTION
EMILIANO BALADJAY v. HON. ZOILO CASTRILLO, in his capacity as Director of Lands, and MARIA BALCITA, G.R. No. L-14766, April 26, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Emiliano Baladjay filed a complaint against the Director of Lands and Maria Balcita, alleging ownership in fee simple of Lot No. 2170 in Ozamiz City through continuous possession since time immemorial [1]. He sought to declare null and void Free Patent No. V-94223 issued to Balcita on April 30, 1958, claiming she obtained it through fraud and never occupied the land [1, 2]. Balcita filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because Baladjay failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that only the Government could seek the cancellation of a title issued via patent [3]. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental granted the motion and dismissed the case [4, 5]. Baladjay appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal. The doctrine requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies and the rule that only the Government may seek reversion of land to the public domain are confined to lands of the *public domain* disposed of under the Public Land Act [5]. These rules are inapplicable to *private lands* [5].

A motion to dismiss assumes the allegations of the complaint are true [6]. Since Baladjay alleged that the lot is his private property and not derived from the Government, he was not bound to resort to administrative remedies as a condition precedent to judicial recourse [6]. Whether he can prove these allegations is a matter of evidence to be determined at trial, not on a motion to dismiss [6].

The Order appealed from is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the case is **REMANDED** to the lower court for further proceedings [7].
