I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO BALMONTE v. JULIAN MARCELO and ALEJANDRO MARCELO, G.R. No. L-12918, April 25, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Santiago Balmonte filed a homestead application for a lot in Isabela in 1937. In 1947, defendant Alejandro Marcelo filed a competing homestead application for the same land. Balmonte eventually secured a favorable order from the Bureau of Lands, leading to the issuance of a patent and Original Certificate of Title No. P-692 in his name in 1949. Alejandro filed a protest claiming priority of occupation, prompting an investigation. While the administrative investigation was pending, Balmonte filed a complaint for recovery of possession and damages against the Marcelos in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela.

In 1955, the Director of Lands issued an order dismissing the Marcelos' claim. Relying on this, Balmonte moved for summary judgment. The Marcelos objected, informing the court that they had seasonably appealed the Director's order to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the appeal was still pending. The CFI disregarded the pending administrative appeal, granted summary judgment declaring Balmonte the owner, and ordered the Marcelos to vacate and pay damages.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment while the administrative appeal regarding the conflicting homestead claims was still pending before the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that judicial action on the relief prayed for should be suspended until the administrative appeal is finally determined. Since both parties claim to derive title from the Government, the final decision of the executive branch on their conflicting claims is essential to the plaintiff's cause of action. The Court reasoned that if the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources were to reverse the Director of Lands and cancel the patent issued to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would have no cause of action against the defendants [1]. The Court relied on the doctrine laid down in *Miguel v. Vda. de Reyes*, *Lubugan v. Castrillo*, and *Geukeko v. Araneta* [1].

The decision and supplemental decision appealed from were **SET ASIDE**, and the records were remanded to the lower court for further proceedings to await the result of the administrative appeal [2].
