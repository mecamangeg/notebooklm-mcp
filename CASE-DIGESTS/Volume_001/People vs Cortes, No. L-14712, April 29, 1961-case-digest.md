I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FEDERICO CORTES alias PEDRING CORTES, G.R. No. L-14712, April 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Federico Cortes was charged with treason for aiding the Japanese Imperial Army in Cebu. The Court of First Instance of Cebu convicted him on Count 1 (serving as an informer/spy) and Count 7 (arresting a civilian). The case was forwarded to the Supreme Court.

Regarding Count 7: On August 28, 1942, Cortes visited Fernando Macasero’s house to exchange money. The next day, Cortes returned with Japanese soldiers, pointed out Macasero's house, and confiscated P6,000. Cortes personally tied Macasero's hands and took him to a school building, where Cortes and the soldiers beat him. Macasero was imprisoned until April 1943. These events were witnessed by Macasero, his wife, and a neighbor, Cornelio Barcelo.

Regarding Count 1: Prosecution witnesses testified that Cortes was a member of the *Kempei Tai* and recruited labor for the Japanese, but these witnesses testified to different, separate activities.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the prosecution satisfied the two-witness rule required to convict the accused of treason.

IV. RULING
**YES** (as to Count 7) and **NO** (as to Count 1).

For Count 1, the Court ruled **NO**. While membership in the *Kempei Tai*, spying, and securing labor for the enemy are competent acts of treason, they were not proven by two witnesses to the *same overt act*. Citing *People v. Adriano*, the Court held that single witnesses testifying to different similar acts do not satisfy the statutory requirement.

For Count 7, the Court ruled **YES**. The arrest and torture of Macasero were proven by the testimonies of three witnesses: Macasero, his wife Teodora Alisna, and Cornelio Barcelo. Barcelo corroborated Macasero’s testimony regarding Cortes pointing out the house, tying Macasero's hands, and the subsequent beating. This satisfied the two-witness rule.

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** based on the guilt of the accused on Count 7 alone.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None.
