I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL GALLARDO, G.R. No. L-12080, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Manuel Gallardo, a married man and shop superintendent of a transport business, maintained an illicit relationship with Basilisa de Lota, with whom he had two children. Basilisa lived in Quezon City with her daughter Fortunata Gisera. To end the affair and avoid trouble with his wife, Manuel planned to dispose of Basilisa. On March 7, 1951, a bus from Manuel's company fetched Basilisa to bring her to Jaen, Nueva Ecija. She was never seen alive again. The next day, a woman's body matching Basilisa's physical description (height, age, and a scar on the neck) was found in a well in Jaen. A witness testified seeing Manuel and his brother Pascual (who was acquitted) strike a woman and throw her into the well. Manuel subsequently took his illegitimate children from Basilisa's home and misled Fortunata regarding her mother's whereabouts.

The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija convicted Manuel of murder. It originally sentenced him to *reclusion temporal* but amended the decision to *reclusion perpetua* pending appeal. Manuel appealed, questioning the court's jurisdiction, the identification of the corpse, and the amendment of the penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court had jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the identity of the deceased was sufficiently proven despite the lack of direct identification.
3. W/N the accused is guilty of murder qualified by evident premeditation.
4. W/N the civil indemnity was correctly awarded to Fortunata Gisera as the sole heir.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court found direct and positive evidence that a woman was killed in Jaen, Nueva Ecija, on the evening of March 7, 1951 [1]. This established the venue and jurisdiction of the trial court over the offense.

2. **YES.** Although no one in Jaen could visually identify the body as a stranger to the town, circumstantial evidence proved it was Basilisa de Lota beyond reasonable doubt. The body was found the day after she left for Jaen, and it matched her specific physical characteristics (height, age, and a scar on the neck) [2].

3. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction for murder qualified by evident premeditation [3], [4]. The appellant's acts—fetching the victim, killing her to resolve his marital complications (motive), concealing the body, removing the children, and lying about the victim's location—established his guilt [5], [4]. Regarding the penalty, the Court ruled that the lower court's amendment of the sentence was a moot question because, on appeal, the Supreme Court has plenary authority to impose the proper penalty, which is *reclusion perpetua* [6].

4. **NO.** The Court modified the civil liability award. Since the record established that the deceased was survived by three children (Fortunata and the two illegitimate children with the appellant), the indemnity must be paid to the "heirs of the deceased" collectively, not solely to Fortunata Gisera [3], [4].

The decision is **MODIFIED** regarding the indemnity payment to the heirs, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Labrador and J.B.L. Reyes reserved their votes [7].
