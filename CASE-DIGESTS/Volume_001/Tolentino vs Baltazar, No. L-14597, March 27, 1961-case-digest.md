I. CAPTION
PASTOR TOLENTINO v. BASILIO BALTAZAR, DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF LANDS and ESTATE OF ANGEL BALTAZAR, G.R. No. L-14597, March 27, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Angel Baltazar filed a homestead application for a parcel of land in Nueva Ecija, which was approved on August 14, 1940 [1]. On April 1, 1941, Angel mortgaged the present and future improvements on the land to Pastor Tolentino for P1,500, with the agreement that if unpaid within six years, Tolentino could foreclose or compel the sale of the improvements [1, 2]. Angel died in 1945, and his heirs conveyed their rights to his son, Basilio Baltazar [2]. Relying on this, Basilio successfully applied for a homestead patent in his own name, obtaining Original Certificate of Title No. P-790 in 1951 [2]. Basilio knew of the existing mortgage on the improvements [3].

Tolentino filed suit to enforce his rights. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling Basilio was not guilty of fraud and Tolentino only had a money claim against Angel's estate [4]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that: (1) the mortgage on improvements was a defective chattel mortgage; (2) the homestead could not be liable for debts contracted within five years of the patent issuance; and (3) Tolentino lacked personality to sue for reversion [5, 6]. Tolentino appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the improvements on a homestead can be validly mortgaged and registered as real property despite the prohibition on encumbering the land.
2. W/N Basilio Baltazar can be compelled to execute a deed of mortgage on the improvements.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 prohibits the encumbrance or alienation of the homestead land within five years from the issuance of the patent, but it explicitly permits the mortgage or pledge of improvements and crops [7, 8]. While parties may treat improvements as chattels, they are immovable property under Article 415 of the Civil Code insofar as the public is concerned [8]. Therefore, a mortgage constituted on such improvements is susceptible of registration as a real estate mortgage and annotation on the certificate of title, even if the land itself cannot be encumbered [8].

2. **YES.** Basilio Baltazar knew the improvements were subject to a valid and subsisting mortgage in favor of Tolentino before he secured his patent and title [3]. Consequently, he is deemed to have received the patent and title subject to a subsisting trust regarding the mortgage [3]. He may be compelled to execute the necessary instrument to register the mortgage and annotate it on the title [3].

The appealed decision is **REVERSED**, and Basilio Baltazar is ordered to execute the deed of mortgage in favor of Tolentino and surrender his title for annotation [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
