**I. CAPTION**
FERNANDO MENDOZA v. EDILBERTO Y. DAVID, ET AL., G.R. No. L-19452, March 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 28, 1954, petitioner Fernando Mendoza imported 1,000 crates of onions but failed to file an entry [1]. The Collector of Customs advertised the goods for public auction under Section 1395(c) of the Revised Administrative Code [1]. Mendoza’s attempt to reclaim the goods under Section 1324 was denied, so he filed a petition for mandamus with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to stop the auction and compel delivery [1]. Meanwhile, the Collector ordered the seizure of the shipment for customs violations, shifting the proceeding from sale to forfeiture [2].

The CFI granted the injunction upon Mendoza's filing of a P5,000.00 bond [2]. However, upon inspection on August 21, 1954, Mendoza discovered most of the onions had deteriorated [2, 3]. Consequently, he abandoned the merchandise to the Collector under Section 1321 of the Revised Administrative Code and moved to dismiss the case, which the CFI granted [3]. Respondents (Customs officials) moved for reconsideration, arguing the injunction bond should be forfeited to cover government revenues, but the CFI denied the motion [3]. Respondents appealed, arguing the bond should answer for charges due under Section 1397 of the Revised Administrative Code [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the injunction bond is liable for forfeiture when the imported merchandise was abandoned by the importer and never released from Customs custody.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that there is no basis to forfeit the injunction bond. The purpose of the injunction—to restrain the sale and compel delivery to the importer—was never attained because the merchandise remained under the exclusive custody of the Collector of Customs from its arrival until its abandonment [5].

The Court explained that an injunction bond answers for the release of the merchandise, merely taking the place of the goods; if the release is not effected, there is no valid reason for forfeiting the bond [6-8]. Furthermore, the liability of an importer regarding forfeited goods is limited to the value of the imported merchandise itself [9, 10]. Section 1398 of the Revised Administrative Code implies that in cases of forfeiture, the maximum penalty imposable is the forfeiture itself, as it expressly decrees that no part of any surplus from the sale shall be returned to the importer [10]. Since Mendoza abandoned the goods, the Collector was free to continue with seizure proceedings [11].

The orders appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [12].
