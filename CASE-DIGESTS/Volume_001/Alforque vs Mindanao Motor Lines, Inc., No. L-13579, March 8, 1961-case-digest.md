I. CAPTION
EPIFANIO ALFORQUE, ET AL. v. MINDANAO MOTOR LINES, INC., G.R. No. L-13579, March 8, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Fifty-three (53) plaintiffs filed a case against defendant Mindanao Motor Lines, Inc. [1]. The Court of First Instance of Davao ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the defendant to pay a total sum of P157,560.79, plus P10,600.00 in attorney's fees and litigation expenses [1]. The individual awards for each plaintiff ranged from P125.00 to P3,685.00 [2]. The defendant appealed directly to the Supreme Court, likely under the impression that the Court had jurisdiction because the aggregate amount awarded exceeded P50,000.00 [1]. In its brief, the appellant questioned the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the lower court's findings of fact [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [2].

The Court cited three grounds for this ruling:
1.  **Statutory Threshold:** Under Republic Act No. 2613, approved on August 1, 1959, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over all civil cases where the value in controversy does not exceed P200,000.00. The total sum awarded in this case (P157,560.79 plus fees) is less than this limit [2].
2.  **Separate Causes of Action:** The cause of action of each plaintiff is separate and distinct, and the individual amounts involved (ranging from P125.00 to P3,685.00) are well within the lower court's jurisdiction [2].
3.  **Questions of Fact:** The appellant raised questions regarding the sufficiency of evidence, which involves findings of fact properly reviewable by the Court of Appeals [2].

Consequently, pursuant to Section 31 of Republic Act No. 296, as amended, the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for disposition [3].
