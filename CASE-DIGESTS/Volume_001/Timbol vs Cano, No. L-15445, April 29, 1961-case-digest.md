I. CAPTION
TIMBOL v. CANO, G.R. No. L-15445, April 29, 1961, 1 SCRA 1238, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Mercedes Cano died in 1945, leaving her minor son, Florante Timbol, as her sole heir. Her brother, Jose Cano, was appointed administrator in 1946. In 1951, Jose Cano proposed to lease the estate's agricultural lands to himself, which the lower court approved. In 1957, Florante Timbol replaced Jose Cano as administrator. Florante subsequently moved to increase the land area allocated for a subdivision project from 30 to 41.9 hectares. Jose Cano objected, arguing this would reduce the land under his lease and that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to deprive him of his rights under a valid contract. The lower court granted Florante's motion and declared the lease contract void ab initio. Jose Cano appealed, contending that the probate court lost jurisdiction because a project of partition had already been approved.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the probate court has jurisdiction to revoke or modify a lease contract it previously approved.
2. W/N the lease contract entered into by the administrator with the estate is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The probate court retains jurisdiction over the estate until all debts are paid and the remaining estate is delivered to the heirs. In this case, the estate had not yet been fully delivered nor debts fully paid. As a trustee, the probate court has the duty to guard the estate. If the court has the right to approve a lease, it implies the power to order its revocation or reduction, as the act of leasing is an act of administration subject to court approval [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** The lease is null and void. Under **Article 1646 of the Civil Code**, persons disqualified to buy under **Articles 1490 and 1491** are also disqualified from becoming lessees. Specifically, Article 1491(3) prohibits administrators from acquiring the property of the estate under their administration. Consequently, the lease executed by Jose Cano in his favor while he was the administrator is prohibited by law and is immoral [4], [5].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED.
