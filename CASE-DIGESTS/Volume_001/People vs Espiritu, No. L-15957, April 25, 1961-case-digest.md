I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BENJAMIN ESPIRITU, G.R. No. L-15957, April 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On May 26, 1959, an information for homicide thru reckless imprudence was filed against Benjamin Espiritu, a 13-year-old minor, before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija [1, 2]. After successfully moving for the reduction of his bail bond twice, Espiritu's counsel requested that, pending the posting of bail, the accused be released and placed under the custody of a responsible person [2]. The trial court granted the motion and ordered Espiritu released to the care and custody of Atty. Honorio V. Garcia [3]. The Government appealed this order, disputing the trial court's authority to release the accused without bail to a private person pending the trial on the merits [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order releasing the minor to the custody of a private person is appealable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the order of the trial court releasing the minor from confinement without bail and placing him in the custody of a private individual is **interlocutory** in nature [4, 5]. An interlocutory order cannot be the subject of an appeal until final judgment is rendered, pursuant to Section 2, Rule 41 [4]. The Court clarified that if the Government believed the trial court acted improperly, the appropriate remedy was to file a writ of *certiorari*, not an appeal [4].

Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [4].
