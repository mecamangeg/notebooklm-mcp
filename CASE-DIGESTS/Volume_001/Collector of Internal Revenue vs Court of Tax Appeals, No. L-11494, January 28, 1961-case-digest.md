I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS and HUME PIPE and ASBESTOS CO., INC., G.R. No. L-11494, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Hume Pipe & Asbestos Co., Inc. (Hume Pipe) paid its assessed income tax for 1954 in two installments on August 14, 1954, and November 11, 1954. On June 12, 1956, Hume Pipe filed a claim for refund of P6,445.00 with the Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR), alleging overpayment regarding dividends received. On August 14, 1956, while the claim was still pending with the CIR, Hume Pipe filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) to recover the tax, fearing the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Tax Code was about to expire (reckoned from the first installment). The CIR questioned the CTA's jurisdiction, arguing that the CTA could not take cognizance of the case without a prior decision from the Collector. The CTA issued a resolution declaring it had jurisdiction and set the case for hearing. The CIR appealed this resolution to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR can appeal the CTA's interlocutory resolution to the Supreme Court.
2. W/N the CTA has jurisdiction over a petition for review filed before the CIR renders a decision on a refund claim to prevent prescription.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Republic Act No. 1125, appeals to the Supreme Court may only be taken against *final* rulings, orders, and decisions of the CTA. The resolution asserting jurisdiction and setting the case for hearing is merely interlocutory. Interlocutory orders cannot be appealed until a final decision on the merits is rendered to prevent multiple appeals from delaying the administration of justice.

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed that the CTA properly assumed jurisdiction. Under Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code, a suit for the recovery of taxes erroneously or illegally collected must be filed within two years from the date of payment. The Court ruled that if the Collector fails to act on a refund claim and the two-year period is about to expire, the taxpayer need not wait for the Collector's decision. Requiring a decision before filing suit would leave the taxpayer at the mercy of the Collector's inaction and cause their right of action to prescribe. The taxpayer is justified in presuming a denial and filing the petition to protect their rights.

Petition dismissed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred, citing the rulings in *Gibbs v. Collector of Internal Revenue* and *Johnston Lumber Co. v. Court of Tax Appeals* as basis for the decision.
