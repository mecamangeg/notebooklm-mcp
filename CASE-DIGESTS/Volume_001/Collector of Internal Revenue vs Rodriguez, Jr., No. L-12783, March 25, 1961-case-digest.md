I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. HON. EULOGIO RODRIGUEZ, JR., ET AL., G.R. No. L-12783, March 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In 1955, respondent Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr. imported a Chevrolet Bel Air sedan from the United States for personal use. The vehicle was brought into the Philippines unboxed as unaccompanied baggage, with a push-button radio and antenna already installed by the seller, General Motors Corporation. The invoice price of $2,083.00 included the cost of the radio and antenna ($88.05).

The petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue assessed the compensating tax based on the total landed cost of the vehicle, including the radio and antenna. Rodriguez paid the tax but subsequently claimed a refund of P1,072.68, arguing that the radio and antenna should not form part of the taxable base of the automobile but should be taxed separately at a lower rate. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of Rodriguez, holding that the radio and antenna were not parts and accessories of the car and ordered a refund. The Collector filed this petition for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the push-button radio and antenna installed in the imported automobile are considered "parts and accessories" subject to the same compensating tax rate as the vehicle.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CTA decision and held that the radio and antenna are component parts of the automobile.

Under Section 190 of the National Internal Revenue Code, in relation to Sections 184(a) and 185(a), a sale of an automobile includes the chassis, body, and the "parts and accessories with which the same are usually equipped." Adopting the definitions from United States jurisprudence (*Universal Battery Co. v. U.S.*), the Court defined a "part" as an article primarily adapted for use as a component of a vehicle and not for general commercial use.

The Court found that the specific radio and antenna were designed and manufactured primarily for the use of the specific vehicle. They were already installed at the time of purchase and their cost was included in the single invoice. Furthermore, the radio could only operate using the car battery and not ordinary house current, distinguishing it from articles for general use. Recognizing modern trends, the Court noted that radios have become usual equipment and added attractions in automobiles. Consequently, they form part of the taxable base of the automobile.

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is REVERSED, and the decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue is affirmed.
