I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARCIAL AMA Y PEREZ, G.R. No. L-14783, April 29, 1961, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Marcial Ama y Perez, while serving a sentence for a previous conviction, was charged with stabbing and killing Almario Bautista [1]. Ama initially pleaded not guilty but later moved to withdraw his plea. With the assistance of counsel *de oficio*, he pleaded guilty to the charge, which alleged the special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism [2]. Defense counsel asked for the minimum penalty, but the trial court imposed the death penalty, ruling that the mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty could not offset quasi-recidivism [3]. Ama appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in allowing him to change his plea without informing him that the death penalty would still be inevitable despite the plea, and that his counsel failed to properly advise him [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in accepting the plea of guilty without informing the accused that the penalty to be imposed would be death.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court's duty is limited to informing the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation so he may comprehend it [5, 6]. It is not the duty of the court to apprise the accused of the specific penalty to be meted out [6]. Rather, it is the imperative duty of counsel to explain the real import of the charge and the consequences of the plea [5]. The Court found no evidence that the counsel *de oficio* failed in this duty and upheld the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions [7]. A plea of guilty admits all material facts alleged in the information, including the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism [8]. Under Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, quasi-recidivism mandates the maximum period of the penalty (death) regardless of mitigating circumstances [3, 4].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [9].
