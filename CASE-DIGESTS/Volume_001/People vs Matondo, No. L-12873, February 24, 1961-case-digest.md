I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. POTENCIANO MATONDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12873, February 24, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 11, 1955, Potenciano Matondo and 29 others were charged with violating Republic Act No. 947 for allegedly entering and occupying public agricultural land (part of the Davao Penal Colony Reservation) covered by a Sales Application of the Philippine Women's Educational Association without a permit [1]. Instead of entering a plea, the defendants filed a "Motion to Suspend the Issuance of the Warrant of Arrest," claiming they had been in possession of the land since May 10, 1953, prior to the effectivity of R.A. 947 on June 20, 1953 [2]. During the hearing on the motion, the defense presented evidence of their prior occupation and improvements, which the prosecution did not rebut [3]. The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the case, ruling that R.A. 947 does not have retroactive effect and the accused had occupied the land before the law's enactment [4, 5]. The State appealed, arguing the dismissal was procedurally improper as it was based merely on a motion to suspend the warrant of arrest [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court properly dismissed the criminal information based on a "Motion to Suspend the Issuance of the Warrant of Arrest."

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. Although the procedure followed by the lower court was not strictly in accordance with the Rules, the "Motion to Suspend the Issuance of the Warrant of Arrest" may be considered a **Motion to Quash** [6]. It is not the caption of the pleading but the allegations therein that prevail. The motion effectively alleged that the information did not charge an offense because the acts complained of (entry and occupation) occurred before the effectivity of the law punishing them [6]. Since the evidence conclusively showed the accused occupied the land prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 947, they cannot be held liable for violating it [7, 8]. The State was not deprived of its day in court as it had the opportunity to object to evidence and cross-examine witnesses during the hearing on the motion [3].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
