I. CAPTION
ALFREDO REYES v. JOSE PASCUAL, G.R. No. L-16659, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alfredo Reyes and respondent Jose Pascual simultaneously operated ferry services on the Mercedes-Manguisoc line. Reyes began operations on September 25, 1958, after being awarded an exclusive lease by the Municipal Council of Mercedes as the highest bidder and obtaining a "bay and river license" from the Bureau of Customs (BOC). Pascual, on the other hand, began operations earlier on May 15, 1958, relying solely on a BOC "bay and river license." Although Pascual knew of the municipal bidding, he did not participate. Reyes filed a complaint for injunction and damages with the Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte. The lower court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the municipality lacked the power to grant an exclusive privilege and that Pascual’s earlier BOC license gave him the right to operate. Reyes appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a "bay and river license" issued by the Bureau of Customs authorizes a private party to operate a municipal ferry service without a grant or contract from the concerned municipality.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the authority to grant the exclusive right or privilege to operate a municipal ferry service lies with the municipality concerned, not with the Bureau of Customs. Under Sections 2318-2320 of the Revised Administrative Code, municipal councils have the specific authority to let municipal ferries to the highest bidder. This specific jurisdiction prevails over the general jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs under the Tariff and Customs Code, which relates primarily to the seaworthiness and safety of vessels rather than the granting of operating rights.

Citing *Municipality of Gattaran v. Elizaga*, the Court reiterated that a private party must first be awarded the right to operate by the municipality before obtaining other necessary permits. While a BOC license is a condition precedent for the vessel's operation, it does not replace the requirement for a municipal grant. Consequently, Reyes, holding the municipal award, has the exclusive legal right to conduct the service.

The judgment appealed from is **REVERSED**, and respondent Pascual is permanently enjoined from operating the ferry service.
