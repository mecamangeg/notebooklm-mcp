I. CAPTION
FELIX DE CASTRO, JR., QUIRINO AMBROSIO and ANTONIO CARAMBAS v. EMITERIO M. CASTAÑEDA and RAMON G. LICERALDE, G.R. No. L-15139, April 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, the Provincial Fiscal and Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan, filed an information charging petitioners with violation of Act No. 4003 (fishing with the use of poison) based on the affidavits of Catalino Malanum and Laureano Pasag [1]. Upon petitioners' motion, the Court of First Instance (CFI) ordered a reinvestigation [1]. During the reinvestigation, petitioners requested the inclusion of Malanum and Pasag as co-defendants, arguing that their affidavits revealed they actively participated in the crime by pouring the poison and gathering the poisoned fish [1-3]. The respondents refused, asserting their exclusive prerogative to determine who to charge and claiming Malanum and Pasag were necessary witnesses [4, 5]. Petitioners filed a petition for *mandamus* to compel their inclusion. The CFI granted the writ, ordering the Fiscals to include Malanum and Pasag in the information [6]. Respondents appealed [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Fiscal can be compelled by *mandamus* to include in the information persons who appear responsible for the commission of the crime based on the evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court [8]. While the prosecuting officer has the discretion to determine whether evidence is sufficient to charge a person, this power is not absolute and is subject to judicial review [9]. Under Section 1, Rule 106 of the Rules of Court (now Rule 110), criminal actions must be brought against "all persons who appear to be responsible therefor" [7]. This provision is mandatory to prevent prosecutors from shielding favorites [10].

The Court relied on the doctrine in *Guiao v. Figueroa*, holding that if persons appear responsible for an offense, they must be included in the information [6, 7]. If the prosecution intends to utilize them as state witnesses, the proper procedure is not to exclude them from the outset, but to include them in the information and subsequently move for their discharge under the provisions of the law (Rules on exclusion of defendants) [5]. Since the affidavits showed Malanum and Pasag participated in the commission of the offense [3], it was the Fiscal's duty to include them. The petition was granted and the judgment appealed from was affirmed [8].
