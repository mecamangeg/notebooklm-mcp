**I. CAPTION**
JUAN ADUAN, ET AL. v. PANTALEON ALBA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-17046, April 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Juan Aduan and other applicants-appellees held a registered title to a parcel of land. On March 26, 1958, they filed a motion for a writ of possession, alleging that Pantaleon Alba and others were pasturing animals and destroying crops on the premises [1]. Alba and his co-appellants opposed the motion, claiming they occupied portions of the land which were the subject of a homestead application they filed with the Bureau of Lands [1]. They argued that the trial court erred in not nullifying Aduan’s certificate of title because the land was forestal in character and could not be acquired by the appellees [2]. Furthermore, they claimed the decree of registration was void because, despite being in possession of the land, they were never personally notified of the petition for registration [2]. The Court of First Instance of La Union granted the writ of possession, prompting Alba et al. to appeal [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N private individuals can question the validity of a registered title on the ground that the land includes portions which are forestal in character.
2. W/N the decree of registration is void for lack of personal notice to the appellants who were in possession of the land.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that even if the land registered includes portions which are forestal in character, a private individual cannot question the validity of the title registered in the applicant's name [3, 4]. The right to raise the issue regarding the validity of the acquisition belongs to the Bureau of Forestry, not the appellants [5]. In this case, the Bureau of Forestry was duly notified of the proceedings but failed to file an objection, which belied the appellants' claim [4, 5].

2. **NO.** The Court held that no importance could be attached to the appellants' claim of lack of notice. Since they were occupying forest land with the intent to apply for a homestead, their right to the land was merely subsidiary to that of the government [6]. Moreover, the petition for registration was published in the Official Gazette, which is deemed sufficient notice in contemplation of law [6].

The order appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [7].
