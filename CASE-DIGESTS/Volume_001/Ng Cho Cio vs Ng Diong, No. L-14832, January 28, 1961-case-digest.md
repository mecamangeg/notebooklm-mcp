I. CAPTION
NG CHO CIO, et al. v. NG DIONG, et al., G.R. No. L-14832, January 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs and defendant Ng Diong were partners in the firm "Ng Chin Beng Hermanos," established in 1925 with a term extending to May 23, 1941 [1]. Ng Diong served as the managing partner. In 1938, the partnership was declared insolvent [2]. However, a composition agreement with creditors was approved by the court on October 10, 1940 [3]. On October 6, 1945, the court declared the insolvency proceedings terminated and ordered the reconveyance of properties to the partnership, which the assignee executed on April 2, 1946 [3], [4].

On that same day, April 2, 1946, Ng Diong, acting as manager, sold several partnership properties to creditor C.N. Hodges for P124,580.00 to settle partnership obligations [5]. Plaintiffs sued to recover their shares, arguing the sale was void because the properties were still in *custodia legis* and the partnership term had already expired in 1941 [6], [7]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sale of partnership properties is void on the ground that they were still in *custodia legis*.
2. W/N the managing partner had the authority to sell partnership properties for liquidation purposes after the expiration of the partnership term.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The properties were no longer in *custodia legis* at the time of the sale. The Court held that the insolvency proceedings legally and practically ended when the court approved the composition agreement and ordered the closure of the case on October 6, 1945 [4]. Upon the actual reconveyance of the properties on April 2, 1946, the partnership was restored to its *status quo* and reacquired its personality [4]. Consequently, the partnership was free to dispose of its properties to protect its interests [4].

2. **YES.** Ng Diong validly exercised his authority as liquidator. Although the partnership's term expired in 1941, the general manager retains the authority to wind up business affairs and liquidate assets [7]. The Court ruled that the sale of lots to pay debts is an act of liquidation sanctioned by Article 228 of the Code of Commerce, the law in force at the time [7].

The petition was denied, and the decision of the lower court was **AFFIRMED** [9].
