**I. CAPTION**
**ROSARIO S. JUAT, ET AL. v. THE LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-17080, January 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners are the heirs of Alberto Santos, the former lessee of a lot within the Tambobong Estate. After the government acquired the estate, the petitioners continued possession and paid rentals until 1947 [1, 2]. In 1954, the Bureau of Lands notified them to enter a contract of sale for the lot. Petitioners requested an extension and a reconsideration of the purchase price, but received no further reply [2]. Later, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources sold the lot to the Province of Rizal for use as a vocational school site [3, 4]. Petitioners filed an action to annul the sale, arguing that under Section 1 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 539, they had the preferential right to purchase the lot as *bona fide* tenants [5]. The trial court dismissed their complaint [6, 7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the sale of the lot to the Province of Rizal violated the petitioners' preferential rights under C.A. No. 539.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court held that while Section 1 of C.A. No. 539 authorizes the subdivision of expropriated estates for resale to *bona fide* tenants, Section 10 of the same Act expressly empowers the President to sell portions of said lands to provinces or municipalities for public purposes, such as schools [3, 8, 9]. Section 1 does not exclude the application of Section 10; rather, the President has the discretion to choose between selling to tenants or to local governments [3]. Once exercised, this choice is final. In this case, the sale to the Province of Rizal for a vocational school aligns with the constitutional mandate to promote public education [4].

Furthermore, the Court noted that the petitioners were not *bona fide* tenants entitled to preference because they had failed to pay rentals since 1947 [4]. The act of the Department Secretary in effecting the sale is presumed to be the act of the President [3].

**Decision affirmed.**
