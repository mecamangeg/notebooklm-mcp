I. CAPTION
EDUARDO TUASON v. LUZON STEVEDORING CO., INC. and JULIAN RAMOS, G.R. No. L-13541, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
On April 13, 1953, around 5:10 A.M., a collision occurred in Capas, Tarlac, between a Packard car driven by plaintiff Eduardo Tuason and a truck-trailer owned by defendant Luzon Stevedoring Co., Inc., driven by defendant Julian Ramos. Tuason, who was driving from Baguio to Manila, claimed he was driving at moderate speed on the right lane when the truck, allegedly moving recklessly without lights, struck his car [1-3]. Defendants countered that Ramos was driving slowly on the proper lane when Tuason, speeding and encroaching on the left lane, hit the truck [4].

Almost three years later, Tuason filed a complaint for damages. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, finding Tuason solely responsible for the accident based on contradictory testimonies of his witnesses and physical evidence [3, 5, 6]. Tuason appealed directly to the Supreme Court [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the defendants are liable for damages resulting from the collision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the plaintiff was solely and wholly responsible for the collision [6].

The Court applied the principle that findings of fact by the trial judge regarding witness credibility are entitled to great weight, as the judge observed their demeanor [6]. The evidence established that Tuason was the proximate cause of the accident [7]. Calculations of travel time proved Tuason was driving at excessive speed (covering 144 km in roughly 1 hour and 50 minutes), while the truck was moving slowly [8]. Furthermore, police reports and skid marks showed Tuason swerved into the truck's lane, whereas the truck was properly positioned on its right [9-11].

Additionally, the Court noted that the filing of the complaint nearly three years after the accident was in itself indicative of the weakness of the plaintiff's cause of action (Laches) [7].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
