I. CAPTION
DELFIN MERCADER v. HON. FRANCISCO VALILA OF THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT OF BOBON, SAMAR and AMANCIO BALITE, G.R. No. L-16118, February 16, 1961, Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
On April 20, 1959, respondent Amancio Balite filed a criminal complaint for libel against petitioner Delfin Mercader with the Justice of the Peace Court of Bobon, Samar. Respondent Judge Valila conducted a preliminary examination and issued a warrant of arrest [1]. Mercader moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging lack of jurisdiction and cause of action, but the motion was denied [1]. Consequently, Mercader filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing that under Republic Act No. 1289, which amended Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code, inferior courts lost jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigations for libel [2]. The Respondent Judge maintained that he took cognizance of the case solely for preliminary investigation and had already forwarded the case to the Court of First Instance for trial on the merits [3]. Mercader further argued that venue was improperly laid because neither the complainant nor the defendant resided in Bobon [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Justice of the Peace courts retained the authority to conduct preliminary investigations in libel cases after the enactment of Republic Act No. 1289.
2. W/N venue was properly laid in Bobon, Samar.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that Republic Act No. 1289 did not deprive Justice of the Peace courts (now Municipal Courts) of their power to conduct preliminary investigations in libel cases [5, 6]. Relying on the doctrine in *People v. Olarte* (L-13027), the Court reasoned that there was no legislative intent to divest these courts of such authority [2, 7]. Repeals by implication are not favored, and the authority of justices of the peace to conduct preliminary investigations is consistent with the original jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance to hear and determine the case on the merits [8].

2. **YES.** While the general rule is based on residency, the statute (Article 360, Revised Penal Code) provides that where the libel is published or circulated in a province or city wherein neither the offended party nor the offender resides, the action may be brought therein [4, 5]. Since the complaint alleged that the libel was published and circulated in Bobon and other municipalities of Samar, the venue was properly laid [4].

The petition is **DISMISSED** [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Paras, C.J. (Dissenting):**
Chief Justice Paras dissented, reiterating his position in *Meris v. Olarte*. He argued that Article 360 expressly mandates that libel cases "shall be filed" with the Court of First Instance, implying exclusive jurisdiction even at the preliminary stage [10, 11]. He posited that the law intended to prevent harassment of defendants by local justices of the peace and to ensure fairness by confining proceedings to the Court of First Instance [12, 13].
