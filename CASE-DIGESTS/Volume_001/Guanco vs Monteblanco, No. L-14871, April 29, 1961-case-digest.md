I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO M. GUANCO, accompanied by her husband, CELSO S. GUANCO v. SEGUNDO MONTEBLANCO and NICOLAS MONTEBLANCO, G.R. No. L-14871, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellees, Spouses Guanco, filed a complaint against defendants Segundo and Nicolas Monteblanco involving various family properties and sugar quotas. Nicolas filed an amended answer with three counterclaims. His second and third counterclaims alleged that Segundo sold properties held in trust for Nicolas to purchase "Hacienda Fidela" in the plaintiffs' names and to satisfy plaintiffs' debts, based on the plaintiffs' assurance that they would deliver the property to Nicolas upon demand. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss these specific counterclaims. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental granted the motion. Nicolas appealed the order of dismissal to the Supreme Court, even though the main case had not yet been heard or decided.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the order dismissing the second and third counterclaims is appealable.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the resolution dismissing the counterclaims is interlocutory in nature and, therefore, not appealable before final judgment is rendered in the main case [1, 2]. The Court explained that the issues raised in Nicolas's dismissed counterclaims were "interwoven" with the main issues in the plaintiffs' complaint and the substantially identical counterclaims filed by the co-defendant, Segundo Monteblanco [2, 3]. A determination of the merits of the appeal at this stage would lead to a prejudgment of the pending causes of action in the lower court [3]. The Court cited *Caldera v. Balcueba* (84 Phil. 304) to support the dismissal of the appeal [2].

Appeal dismissed [4].
