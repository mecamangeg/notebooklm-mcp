I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. VICTORIANO VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-15014, April 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Victoriano Villanueva was accused in the Justice of the Peace Court of Batangas of the crime of serious and less serious physical injuries with damage to property in the amount of P2,636.00 through reckless imprudence [1]. After Villanueva pleaded not guilty, the private prosecutor challenged the court's jurisdiction, arguing that the imposable fine for the damage to property, in addition to the penalty for physical injuries, exceeded the Justice of the Peace Court's jurisdiction [1]. Consequently, the Justice of the Peace Court declared itself without jurisdiction and forwarded the case to the Court of First Instance (CFI) [1]. The CFI subsequently issued an order of dismissal, which the prosecution appealed to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the complex crime of physical injuries with damage to property in the amount of P2,636.00.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal, ruling that the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that if the offense resulted only in damage to property worth P2,636.00, the CFI would undoubtedly have jurisdiction; therefore, it would be absurd to hold that jurisdiction lies with the Justice of the Peace Court when the graver offense of physical injuries is added to the damage [3]. The Court emphasized that the presumption is against absurdity and that the judicial system allocates more serious crimes to the CFI [3]. Additionally, assigning jurisdiction to the inferior court would create a predicament where, if the prosecution failed to prove the physical injuries but established the damage, the Justice of the Peace Court would lack jurisdiction to impose the mandatory fine for the damage [4]. The order appealed from was reversed, and the records were remanded to the court *a quo* for trial on the merits [5].
