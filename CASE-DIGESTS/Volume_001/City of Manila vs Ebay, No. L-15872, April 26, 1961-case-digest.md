I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF MANILA v. ANTONIA EBAY, G.R. No. L-15872, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On November 11, 1958, the City of Manila filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to eject respondent Antonia Ebay from a parcel of land intended for a children's playground. The City alleged that Ebay had occupied the land since 1950 through strategy and stealth [1]. However, it was proven that the City had accepted rental payments from Ebay on March 20, 1956, and March 17, 1957, covering periods in 1950 [2]. On November 3, 1958, the City sent Ebay a notice to vacate and pay damages. Upon her failure to comply, the City filed the suit [1]. The CFI dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the case was for unlawful detainer [2]. The City appealed, raising for the first time that Ebay lacked a building permit [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court ruled that the City's acceptance of rental payments converted the respondent's possession from illegal to legal, thereby creating a landlord-tenant relationship [2]. Because the possession was by lease and the action was filed within 15 days after the demand to vacate was sent, the suit was clearly an action for ejectment (unlawful detainer) under Section 2, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court [4]. Such cases fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, not the Court of First Instance [4]. The Court also held that the issue regarding the lack of a building permit could not be raised for the first time on appeal [3].

Judgment affirmed [5].
