I. CAPTION
ARCE SONS AND COMPANY v. SELECTA BISCUIT COMPANY, INC., ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-14761 & L-17981, January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 253, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Since 1933, Ramon Arce (petitioner’s predecessor) used the name "SELECTA" for his milk business, and later for his restaurant, ice cream, and bakery products. The name was inscribed on bottles, signboards, wrappers, containers, and delivery trucks [1, 2]. In 1950, he transferred the business and the right to use the name to petitioner Arce Sons and Company [3].

In 1955, respondent Selecta Biscuit Company, Inc. was organized and began manufacturing biscuits and bakery products using the trademark "SELECTA" [4]. Respondent filed a petition with the Philippine Patent Office to register the mark [5]. Petitioner opposed the registration and filed a separate complaint for unfair competition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [6, 7].

The CFI ruled in favor of petitioner, enjoining respondent from using the name and awarding damages [7]. However, the Director of Patents dismissed petitioner's opposition, ruling that petitioner only used "SELECTA" as a trade-name (indicating location/business) rather than a trademark (indicating origin), and that respondent's registration would not cause confusion [8, 9]. The cases were consolidated before the Supreme Court [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioner has acquired the exclusive right to use the name "SELECTA" such that respondent’s use constitutes unfair competition and infringement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the petitioner’s use of "SELECTA" was not merely as a trade-name but as a trademark. A trademark is a distinctive mark of authenticity used to distinguish merchandise [11]. The evidence showed petitioner used the name on its goods (bottles, cans, wrappers) to indicate origin, distinct from the products of others [12, 13].

Furthermore, the doctrine of secondary meaning applies. Even if "SELECTA" were considered a common or descriptive word (implying "selected"), it had acquired a proprietary connotation due to petitioner's long and exclusive use since 1933 [14]. Under this doctrine, a word originally incapable of exclusive appropriation may become exclusively associated with a user's products in the mind of the purchasing public [15]. The Court cited *Ang v. Teodoro*, noting that respondent's use would lead to confusion in trade and usurpation of petitioner's goodwill [15]. The Court also rejected respondent's defense that "SELECTA" was merely a translation of a Chinese word, finding it untenable and indicative of an intent to capitalize on petitioner’s established reputation [16, 17].

The decision of the Director of Patents (L-14761) is **REVERSED**, and the decision of the Court of First Instance (L-17981) is **AFFIRMED**.
