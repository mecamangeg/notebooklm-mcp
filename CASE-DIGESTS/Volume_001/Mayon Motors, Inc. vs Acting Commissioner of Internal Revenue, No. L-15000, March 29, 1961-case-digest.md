I. CAPTION
MAYON MOTORS, INC. v. ACTING COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15000, March 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Mayon Motors, Inc. imported 17 Pontiac automobiles in three separate shipments. The landed cost for the units ranged from P4,696.50 to P5,060.60 [1, 2]. Petitioner paid advance sales tax based on its own computations. The Respondent Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency advance sales tax, arguing that the automobiles should be classified under Section 184 of the Tax Code (luxury cars) rather than Section 185 (ordinary cars) [2]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the respondent's method of calculation: to determine the classification, the minimum mark-up of 50% is added to the landed cost to arrive at a theoretical "selling price." Since the landed cost plus 50% exceeded P5,000 for all units, the CTA ruled they fell under Section 184, which imposes a higher mark-up of 100% for the tax calculation [3, 4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the classification should be based on the landed cost alone, which was under P5,000 for most units, and criticized the CTA's "spiral-zigzag" method of calculation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the classification of imported automobiles under Section 184 or 185 for advance sales tax purposes is determined by the landed cost alone.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [6]. The Court held that under Section 183(B) in relation to Sections 184 and 185 of the Tax Code, the rate of sales tax depends upon the "selling price" of the article, not the landed cost alone [7]. Since the tax is paid in advance upon importation, the selling price is theoretical and must be determined by adding the mark-up to the landed cost [8]. The correct procedure is to add the minimum mark-up (50%) to the landed cost; if the resulting amount exceeds P5,000, the automobile is enumerated in Section 184 [8]. Once enumerated in Section 184, the specific provision mandates a 100% mark-up be added to the landed cost to determine the tax [4]. The Court further noted that with the amendment of Section 183(B) by Republic Act No. 594, advance sales tax became final, confirming that "landed cost plus mark-up" represents the theoretical selling price [9]. The Court also ruled that it is not bound by a legislator's personal opinion expressed in congressional debates regarding the interpretation of the law [10]. The decision appealed from was affirmed [6].
