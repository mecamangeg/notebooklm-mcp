I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. CONVENTION OF PHILIPPINE BAPTIST CHURCHES and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, No. L-11807, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches, a domestic religious corporation, owns the Iloilo Mission Hospital. The hospital operates a pharmacy that supplies medicines to both charity and paying patients [1]. Charity patients receive medicines free of charge, while paying patients are charged the cost plus a 10% overprice [1]. This mark-up is intended solely to cover the cost of medicines supplied to charity patients and handling expenses, not for profit [1, 2].

On April 14, 1954, Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed the respondent P505.00 for graduated fixed annual tax (privilege tax) for the years 1946 to 1952 based on sales to paying patients [3, 4]. Respondent protested the assessment, but the CIR denied the motion for reconsideration [4]. Respondent paid the tax to prevent levy and appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [3, 4]. The CTA ruled in favor of the respondent, ordering a refund [5]. The CIR appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning the timeliness of the respondent's appeal to the CTA and the tax exemption [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent's appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals was filed on time.
2. W/N the respondent is engaged in business and subject to the privilege tax on business for its sales to paying patients.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the CTA regarding the timeliness of the appeal. A motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue suspends the running of the thirty-day period within which the taxpayer may appeal to the proper court [6, 7]. The period resumes running on the day following the taxpayer's receipt of the denial [6]. The Court agreed that the respondent should be given an opportunity to exhaust administrative remedies and that the appeal was filed within the prescriptive period when adjusted for the suspension [2, 7].

2. **NO.** The respondent is not engaged in business for profit and is therefore not subject to the privilege tax [2, 8]. The Court held that the test for determining whether a corporation is engaged in business is whether its business is operated for profit or not [5, 8]. Since the 10% overprice charged to paying patients was charged exclusively to cover the cost of medicines given free to charity patients, the pharmacy was not operated for profit but to afford facilities to hospital patients [8]. Consequently, the sales to paying patients are not taxable [8, 9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [10].
