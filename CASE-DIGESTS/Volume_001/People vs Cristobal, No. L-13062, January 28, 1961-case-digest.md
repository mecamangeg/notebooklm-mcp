I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DOMINADOR CRISTOBAL, G.R. No. L-13062, January 28, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On March 21, 1954, at a cockpit in Masbate, Pepito Valler won a bet and was boxing with the deceased, Crisanto Tugbo, near the gate. While Valler was being held by others, the accused, Dominador Cristobal, attempted to box Tugbo but missed. Cristobal then went behind Tugbo and stabbed him in the back with a bayonet (Exhibit A). Cristobal later threatened Valler to own up to the crime.

The defense claimed that it was Manuel Zurbito, Valler’s uncle, who stabbed the deceased with a bolo. Notably, Antonio Tugbo, the father of the deceased, testified for the defense, corroborating this theory and claiming Cristobal was not present.

The Court of First Instance of Masbate found Cristobal guilty of murder and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as the penalty imposable was *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of murder based on the credibility of the witnesses.
2. W/N the prosecution's failure to present all witnesses listed in the information creates an adverse presumption against it.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s findings on credibility, which command great respect. The prosecution witnesses (Valler, Manuel Zurbito, and Amante) testified in a positive and straightforward manner that Cristobal stabbed the deceased from behind. The Court rejected the testimony of the victim's father, Antonio Tugbo, characterizing him as "an ignorant old man" who was likely persuaded to testify falsely. The Court noted that despite claiming to see Manuel Zurbito kill his son, Antonio never filed a complaint against Zurbito.

2. **NO.** The non-presentation of some witnesses listed in the information (Narciso Martin and Jesus Valladores) does not give rise to an adverse presumption against the prosecution. The Court held that if the defense believed these witnesses could help its cause, it should have presented them, as they were equally at the disposal of the defense.

The decision was **MODIFIED** to impose the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* due to the qualifying circumstance of treachery (*alevosia*) and the absence of modifying circumstances.
