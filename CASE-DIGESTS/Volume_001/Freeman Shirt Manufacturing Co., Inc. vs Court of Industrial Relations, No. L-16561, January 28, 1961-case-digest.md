I. CAPTION
FREEMAN SHIRT MANUFACTURING CO., INC. and SAW MUI v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA DAMIT BALANGAY-NAFLU and FREEMAN SHIRT EMPLOYEES LABOR UNION, G.R. No. L-16561, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Following a certification election won by Freeman Shirt Employees Labor Union, the union and Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co., Inc. entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) [1]. The CBA included a "Union Security; Union Shop" clause requiring membership in the union as a condition for continued employment, under pain of dismissal for failure to join within 30 days [1], [2].

Ten employees, who were already in the service and members of the minority union (NAFLU), refused to join the winning union [3]. Upon the union's demand, the company dismissed them [3]. The dismissed employees filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against the company and the winning union [4]. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) absolved the company of ULP charges but ordered the reinstatement of the employees, ruling that the closed-shop agreement applied only to new hires or non-union members, not to those already employed [4]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that the dismissal of the ULP charge precluded the order for reinstatement [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a closed-shop agreement applies to employees already in the service who are members of another union.
2. W/N the dismissal of unfair labor practice charges against the employer precludes the reinstatement of the dismissed employees.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that a closed-shop agreement authorized under the Industrial Peace Act applies only to persons to be hired or to employees who are not yet members of any labor organization [6]. It is inapplicable to those already in the service who are members of another union [6]. To hold otherwise would render nugatory the right of all employees to self-organization and to choose their own labor organizations, a right guaranteed by the Industrial Peace Act (Sec. 3, R.A. 875) and the Constitution [6]. Furthermore, applying it to existing members of minority unions would render certification elections useless, as the contracting union would become a "perpetual labor union," a result not intended by Congress [7].

2. **NO.** The dismissal of ULP charges does not preclude reinstatement where the dismissal was illegal [8], [5]. The dismissal was illegal because it was based on a closed-shop agreement unauthorized by law as applied to these specific employees [5]. However, the Court affirmed the lower court's decision not to award backpay, as the company acted in good faith and in the honest belief that it could dismiss the employees under the law as it stood prior to this decision [5].

Petition denied; Decision affirmed [9].
