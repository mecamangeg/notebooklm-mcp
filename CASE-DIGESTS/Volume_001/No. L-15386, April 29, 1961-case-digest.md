I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF MARIA LIM VDA. DE UY. JOSE L. UY, special administrator-appellee. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, intervenor-appellee, vs. PACITA UY, JESUS UY, and JOSEFINA UY, oppositors-appellants., G.R. No. L-15386, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Maria Lim Vda. de Uy died intestate on December 5, 1945. Special proceedings for the settlement of her estate were instituted in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, and Jose L. Uy was appointed special administrator [1]. The Republic of the Philippines intervened, claiming estate, inheritance, and war profits taxes amounting to P286,834.91, alleging that weeks before her death, the deceased executed fictitious sales of her properties to her children (appellants Pacita, Jesus, and Josefina Uy) to evade taxes [2].

The appellants denied the tax liability and the fictitious nature of the sales, asserting ownership over the properties [3, 4]. Following the enactment of Republic Act No. 1125, the Republic moved to remand the records regarding the tax claims to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing the case involved disputed assessments [5]. The CFI granted the motion. Appellants appealed, arguing that the probate court had jurisdiction and that the intervention could not alter the nature of the probate proceedings [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction over the disputed tax assessments and the incidental issue of the validity of the property transfers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of the lower court. The Court held that when parties deny the obligation to pay amounts claimed by the Government as taxes, the controversy constitutes a disputed assessment of internal revenue taxes [7]. Under Sections 7 and 22 of Republic Act No. 1125, the Court of Tax Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review such decisions [7].

Although the special proceeding for the estate settlement continues in the probate court, the specific issues regarding the tax obligations must be submitted to the CTA [8]. Furthermore, the determination of whether the deceased's transfers to her children were fictitious or made in contemplation of death (under Section 88(b) of the Tax Code) is merely incidental to the issue of the validity of the disputed assessments [9]. Therefore, the CTA, not the Court of First Instance, is competent to hear and decide the questions concerning the nature of the transfers [9].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
