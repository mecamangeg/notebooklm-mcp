I. CAPTION
FELICIANA EDRALIN v. ANDRES EDRALIN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14399, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
In 1908, respondent Andres Edralin solicited from the "Asociacion Zanjera de Santo Rosario Mamutbut" (an irrigators' association in Ilocos Norte) the revival of a forfeited share originally belonging to his grandfather. Andres paid the required P90.00 entrance fee in installments. Although initial entries in the association's books in 1908 included the name of his sister, petitioner Feliciana Edralin, the Court of Appeals found these were made by mistake [1]. Andres alone paid the subsequent balances, was the sole registered member, and exclusively possessed, cultivated, and paid taxes on the assigned 10 parcels of land from 1908 to 1952 without protest from Feliciana [1]. Notably, the siblings executed an extrajudicial partition of common properties in 1937, but the subject lands were not included [2].

In 1952, Feliciana filed an action for partition claiming 1/2 ownership. The trial court ruled that while ownership remained with the Association, Feliciana was entitled to cultivate half the land based on a theory of joint acquisition of usufructuary rights [3]. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision and dismissed the complaint, ruling that Andres was the sole holder of rights and Feliciana's claim was barred by laches [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Andres Edralin has the exclusive right to the lands assigned by the association.
2. W/N Feliciana Edralin’s claim is barred by laches.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual findings of the Court of Appeals that Andres Edralin alone reacquired the share. The records showed he paid the full entrance fee and was the only registered member effectively recognized by the association [1]. His exclusive possession and administration for over 40 years, along with the payment of taxes, negated Feliciana's claim of co-ownership. The Court held that these factual findings by the appellate court were conclusive and not subject to review [1].

2. **YES.** Feliciana’s failure to assert her rights for 44 years (1908–1952) constituted laches. The Court applied the doctrine in *Buenaventura v. David*, holding that "laches or unreasonable delay on the part of a plaintiff in seeking to enforce a right is not only persuasive of a want of merit but may... be destructive of the right itself" [5]. The omission of the land from the parties' 1937 partition further argued against the genuineness of her claim [2].

Petition **DENIED**. Decision **AFFIRMED** [6].
