I. CAPTION
ORMOC SUGAR CO., INC. and RODOLFO M. REVILLA v. OSCO WORKERS FRATERNITY LABOR UNION (OWFLU), BENITO PORCADILLA, et al., G.R. No. L-15826, January 23, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent OSCO Workers Fraternity Labor Union (OWFLU) filed a complaint for unfair labor practice (ULP) against Petitioners Ormoc Sugar Co. and its manager, Rodolfo Revilla, for the alleged discriminatory dismissal of union officers Benito Porcadilla, Crispino Gendoy, and Andres Tabudlong.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) found Petitioners guilty of ULP. While the CIR ruled that Gendoy and Tabudlong were dismissed for valid causes, it ordered the reinstatement of Porcadilla with backwages. The CIR gave credence to Porcadilla's denial that he was sleeping on duty, disregarding the testimony of the manager, two security guards, and three co-workers who testified that Porcadilla was caught *in flagrante delicto* sleeping during working hours on April 22, 1957 (warned) and May 17, 1957 (dismissed). Petitioners appealed, arguing the CIR findings were not supported by substantial evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Porcadilla was validly dismissed for just cause.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the CIR's decision.

While findings of fact by the CIR are generally binding, they must be supported by substantial evidence, defined in *Ang Tibay v. CIR* as relevant evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate. The Court ruled that the CIR erred in relying on Porcadilla's uncorroborated, self-serving denial while disregarding the testimony of five disinterested co-workers and the manager. The quality of witnesses, not just quantity, prevails; the co-workers had no reason to testify falsely, whereas Porcadilla had a direct interest in the case.

The Court held that the validity of dismissals must be evaluated in light of the background and surrounding circumstances. Being apprehended twice for sleeping during working hours is a just cause for dismissal. The existence of a valid legal cause negates the claim that the employee was dismissed for union activities, as the idea of dismissal as an unfair labor practice is incompatible with dismissal for just cause.

The portion of the CIR decision ordering Porcadilla's reinstatement is SET ASIDE, and his dismissal is declared valid and justified.
