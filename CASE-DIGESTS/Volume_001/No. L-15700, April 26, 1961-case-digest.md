I. CAPTION
CRESENCIA VDA. DE BAKIT v. VERONICO ASPERIN and FELIX T. JAMERO, as Justice of the Peace of Loreto, Surigao, G.R. No. L-15700, April 26, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On November 21, 1955, Veronico Asperin filed a complaint against Cresencia Vda. de Bakit in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Loreto, Surigao. Asperin alleged he bought land from Bakit subject to redemption and that she agreed to work as his tenant but breached their tenancy contract by failing to deliver harvests [1]. Bakit denied being a tenant, claiming the transaction was an equitable mortgage to secure a debt and that she remained the owner [2].

The JP Court ruled in favor of Asperin, ordering Bakit to vacate. Bakit appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) but her counsel later withdrew the appeal [3]. Subsequently, Bakit filed a petition for certiorari with the CFI, attacking the JP Court's jurisdiction [4]. The CFI granted the petition, declaring the JP Court judgment null and void for lack of jurisdiction [5]. Respondents appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Justice of the Peace Court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.
2. W/N the petition for certiorari was proper despite the availability of appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Justice of the Peace Court lacked jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the complaint was for the ejectment of a tenant from agricultural land based on a breach of tenancy contract, which falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the **Court of Agrarian Relations** under R.A. No. 1199 and R.A. No. 1267 [6]. Second, Bakit’s answer raised the issue of ownership (whether the contract was a sale or a mortgage), which put the title of the real property in issue. Questions of ownership are not cognizable by the justice of the peace court but fall under the jurisdiction of the **Court of First Instance** (*Teodoro v. Balatbat*) [7-9].

2. **YES.** While respondents argued that certiorari does not lie because Bakit had the remedy of appeal (which she withdrew), the Supreme Court held that the allegations in the petition were sufficient to treat the case as an ordinary action for the **annulment of a decision** rather than strictly a petition for certiorari [10].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is **AFFIRMED** [11].
