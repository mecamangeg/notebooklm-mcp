I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ISIDORO ESCALONA and EPIFANIO ESCALONA, G.R. No. L-13294, March 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On April 6, 1957, at around 7:00 P.M. in Tacloban City, Protacio Eval was walking home with his mother and sister when they passed a group including appellants Isidoro and Epifanio Escalona. Shortly after, Isidoro came from behind, embraced Protacio, and stabbed him on the left forearm with a hunting knife [1]. While Isidoro held the victim tightly, Epifanio approached and stabbed Protacio in the back [2]. The victim died four days later from severe hemorrhage and peritonitis [3]. Isidoro claimed self-defense, while Epifanio denied participation, claiming he merely helped the barrio lieutenant separate the combatants [4, 5]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted them of murder and sentenced them to death [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crime committed was murder qualified by treachery.
2. W/N the aggravating circumstances of superior strength and nighttime, or the mitigating circumstance of intoxication, should be appreciated.
3. W/N the prosecution’s failure to present all witnesses listed in the information constitutes suppression of evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the crime is murder qualified by treachery because the victim was suddenly and unexpectedly assaulted and stabbed from behind by Isidoro, and subsequently stabbed by Epifanio while being held helpless [7]. This mode of attack ensured the execution of the crime without risk to the assailants arising from the defense the victim might make.

2. **NO.** Abuse of superior strength is absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of treachery and cannot be appreciated separately [7, 8]. Nighttime was not an aggravating circumstance because it was not purposely sought by the appellants to commit the crime [7, 8]. Furthermore, intoxication could not be appreciated as a mitigating circumstance because the appellants failed to prove that their intoxication was not habitual; in fact, they implied they were not even drunk [7].

3. **NO.** The mere failure to present prosecution witnesses listed in the information (specifically the victim's sister and another woman) does not warrant an inference that the testimonies were suppressed because they were false [8, 9]. The record showed one testimony was merely corroborative and the other witness was not present at the scene [10].

**Disposition:** The judgment is **MODIFIED**. The penalty is reduced to *reclusion perpetua* as no aggravating or mitigating circumstances were present to raise the penalty to death. [7, 11]
