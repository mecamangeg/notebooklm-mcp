I. CAPTION
VICENTE CAMBARE v. UNION OBRERA DE TABACO LINES, INCORPORATED, G.R. No. L-15940, March 28, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Vicente Cambare operated motor launches for public freight between Tabaco, Albay, and Catanduanes with rates fixed by the Public Service Commission (PSC). Defendant Union Obrera de Tabaco Lines, Inc. obtained a coastwise license from the Bureau of Customs to engage in coastwise trade and operated on the same route. Although the Defendant previously held a provisional authority from the PSC which was later revoked, it continued operations and charged rates lower than those fixed by the PSC. Cambare filed a complaint for damages and a writ of attachment in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Albay. The CFI dismissed the complaint, relying on *Brown v. Suezo*, ruling that since the Defendant possessed a Customs license, its operation was legal and not subject to PSC authority.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission has the authority to regulate the rates and trip schedules of motor launches licensed by the Bureau of Customs for coastwise trade.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while the Public Service Commission (PSC) has no authority to require operators of motor launches licensed by the Bureau of Customs to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC), it retains the authority to prescribe the schedule of trips and the rates to be charged. Distinguishing this case from *Brown v. Suezo* (which focused on the necessity of a CPC), the Court applied the doctrine in *Javellana v. Public Service Commission*. Under Section 13(a) and (b) of the Public Service Act, operators in coastwise trade must still submit their rates and schedules to the PSC for approval. Consequently, the Plaintiff’s complaint, which alleged that the Defendant charged rates below those fixed by the PSC without authority, stated a valid cause of action.

The Order of the trial court was **REVERSED** and set aside, and the case was **REMANDED** for further proceedings.
