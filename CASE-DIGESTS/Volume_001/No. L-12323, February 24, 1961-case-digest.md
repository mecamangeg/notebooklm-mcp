I. CAPTION
QUINTIN RIVERA, ET AL. v. HON. CIPRIANO B. VELASCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12323, February 24, 1961, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioners were employees of the City of San Pablo from August 4, 1952, to May 14, 1953, receiving monthly salaries lower than P120.00 [3]. They were covered by Republic Act No. 602, also known as the Minimum Wage Law, which took effect on August 4, 1952, but the City only implemented its provisions on May 15, 1953 [3]. Consequently, the petitioners did not receive the required salary differentials for that period [3]. The Court of First Instance of Laguna ruled in favor of the petitioners, ordering the City Mayor, Treasurer, and Municipal Board to pay the differentials within 90 days [2]. The respondents appealed the decision to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondents may be compelled by mandamus to appropriate funds for the payment of salary differentials under the Minimum Wage Law. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the provisions of the Minimum Wage Law are mandatory [4]. Since the petitioners had no other remedy in the ordinary course of law, the Court ruled that mandamus lies to compel the respondents to perform their ministerial duty to appropriate the necessary funds for the payment of the claimed salary differentials [4, 5]. The appealed decision was affirmed [4].
