I. CAPTION
DEOGRACIAS G. TRINIDAD and CLARA B. TRINIDAD v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, LINA SANTOS JACINTO, SHERIFF OF RIZAL, and HELEN ZABALLERO, G.R. No. L-17288, March 27, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On December 8, 1959, respondent Lina Santos Jacinto filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal against petitioners, Spouses Trinidad, to collect P2,750.00 evidenced by a promissory note, or to foreclose a chattel mortgage securing the obligation. The petitioners failed to answer and were declared in default. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Santos Jacinto. Consequently, a writ of execution was issued, and petitioners' properties were levied upon.

On May 14, 1960, petitioners filed a motion to set aside the default order, decision, and writ of execution. They argued that under Republic Act No. 2613, which took effect on August 31, 1959, the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the amount involved (P2,750.00) was less than P5,000.00, placing it within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court. The CFI denied the motion on the ground that it was filed more than three months after the decision was rendered. Following the sale of their properties and a motion for further execution by the respondent, petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction before the Supreme Court [1-4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the subject matter.
2. W/N the judgment could be set aside despite the lapse of the time limit for relief under Rule 38.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance lacked jurisdiction. Under Republic Act No. 2613, which amended the Judiciary Act of 1948, inferior courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over civil actions where the value of the subject-matter or amount of the demand does not exceed P5,000.00, exclusive of interests and costs. The amount sought in the complaint was P2,750.00, which is clearly outside the CFI's jurisdiction. Furthermore, regarding the foreclosure aspect, there was no allegation that the mortgaged properties were valued at more than P5,000.00 [4, 5].

2. **YES.** A judgment entered without jurisdiction is a nullity and may be wholly disregarded. The Court ruled that the provisions of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, which place a time limit for filing a petition to set aside a judgment, do not apply to a judgment rendered without jurisdiction. Citing *Banco Espanol-Filipino v. Palanca*, the Court held that a void judgment is a "lawless thing" that can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight. It can be assailed at any time, directly or collaterally [6].

Petition is GRANTED. All proceedings in the lower court are declared null and void and set aside [7].
