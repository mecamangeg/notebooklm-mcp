I. CAPTION
WILLIAM LI YAO v. NARCISA B. DE LEON, et al., G.R. No. L-14324, April 12, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner William Li Yao is the owner of Lot 3, Block 2130 in Manila. Respondents Narcisa B. De Leon, et al. own the adjoining Lots 4-B and 6-B, where they operate the Dalisay Theater [1].

In 1931, the previous owners of Lot 3 (Cu Unjiengs) executed an undertaking to open and maintain a private alley on the lot as a condition imposed by the City Engineer for the issuance of a building permit to their lessee, Smith Bell & Co., whose construction in the interior of the lot had no access to the street [2, 3]. This undertaking was annotated as an encumbrance on the Transfer Certificate of Title [3]. The building served by the alley was destroyed during the liberation of Manila [4].

In 1957, Li Yao filed a petition under Section 112 of Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act) to cancel the annotation, arguing that the building no longer existed and the necessity for the alley had ceased [5]. The City Engineer interposed no objection, confirming that the new building Li Yao intended to construct would not need the alley [6]. The respondents opposed the petition, claiming the alley was indispensable for the fire safety and exit of Dalisay Theater and the maintenance of their air-conditioning equipment [7]. They argued the lower court lacked jurisdiction because there was no unanimity among the parties [8]. The Court of First Instance of Manila overruled the opposition and ordered the cancellation [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance, acting as a Land Registration Court, had jurisdiction to cancel the encumbrance under Section 112 of Act No. 496 despite the respondents' opposition.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of cancellation [1, 10]. The Court ruled that the respondents had no legal interest in the encumbrance and thus their lack of consent did not constitute a valid "lack of unanimity" to divest the court of jurisdiction [11].

The Court explained that the encumbrance was created solely for the benefit of the occupants of the building on Lot 3 to satisfy the City Engineer's requirements under Section 103 of the Revised City Ordinances [12]. The only parties to the undertaking were the owners and the City of Manila [13]. Since the City Engineer agreed to the cancellation, there was unanimity among the real parties in interest [6, 11]. The respondents, being merely adjoining owners, derived only incidental benefits from the alley and possessed no registered right *in rem* over it [11, 14]. If the respondents believe they are entitled to an easement for the safety of their theater, they must establish such right in a separate ordinary action, as they cannot enforce it through an opposition in a Section 112 proceeding [15].
