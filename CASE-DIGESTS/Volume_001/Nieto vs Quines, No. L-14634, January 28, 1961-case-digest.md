I. CAPTION
ARTURO NIETO v. BARTOLOME QUINES and MIGUEL P. PIO, G.R. No. L-14634, January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 227, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Bartolome Quines filed a homestead application for a tract of land in Abulug, Cagayan in 1917, which was approved in 1918. He continuously possessed and cultivated the land. In 1927, during cadastral proceedings involving the same land (designated as Lot No. 3044), Quines did not file an answer, relying on assurances from Bureau of Lands employees. Maria Florentino filed a claim for the lot. On August 16, 1930, the cadastral court awarded Lot No. 3044 to Florentino.

However, on August 29, 1930, a homestead patent was issued to Quines, and Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 623 was issued in his name on September 15, 1930. Six months later, on March 12, 1931, OCT No. 11982 was issued to Florentino based on the cadastral award. Florentino later sold the land to petitioner Arturo Nieto in 1952, who obtained a Transfer Certificate of Title. Quines sold the land to respondent Miguel P. Pio in 1953. Nieto filed an action to cancel Quines' title and recover possession. The trial court dismissed Nieto's complaint and upheld Quines' title.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the homestead title of Quines prevails over the cadastral title of Florentino (transferred to Nieto).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, ruling that Quines' title prevails.

A homesteader who has complied with all terms and conditions entitling him to a patent has a vested right over the land and is regarded as its equitable owner [1, 2]. The Court found that Quines had complied with the requirements and submitted final proof long before the cadastral court adjudicated the land to Florentino [2]. Although there was a delay in the issuance of the patent, Quines was already the equitable owner when the cadastral court ordered registration in Florentino's name [1, 2].

Furthermore, applying by analogy the principles governing the double sale of immovable property, Quines' title prevails because he was in continuous possession of the land and obtained his title (September 1930) prior to the issuance of Florentino's title (March 1931) [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
