I. CAPTION
DEMETRIA MERCADO v. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-11553, February 28, 1961, Bengzon, Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Demetria Mercado induced complainant Miguela San Angel to purchase a house and lot from Martina Nebre for P3,000. Mercado offered to advance P1,000 of the purchase price, to be repaid by Miguela with interest. On June 13, 1952, the deed of sale was executed, but Mercado caused the document to be written in her own name as the buyer, instead of Miguela’s [1-4]. Mercado assured Miguela that the title would be transferred to her upon full repayment of the advance. Miguela subsequently repaid the P1,000 advance plus interest to Mercado [1, 5]. However, Mercado later sold the property to a certain Simsuangco and retained the proceeds [1, 5]. The Court of Appeals convicted Mercado of estafa [6]. Mercado petitioned for review, arguing she had an interest in the property due to the money she advanced and that the subsequent sale to Simsuangco was not alleged in the information [5, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Mercado is guilty of estafa for misappropriating the property.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for estafa. The Court held that while Mercado initially advanced a portion of the purchase price, the record established that Miguela had repaid this amount with interest *prior* to Mercado's sale of the property to Simsuangco [5]. Consequently, Mercado had no right to dispose of the property or retain the proceeds. Regarding the defense that the sale to Simsuangco was not mentioned in the information, the Court ruled that since the sale was proven by the testimony of the appellant herself, it was admissible as further proof of the conversion and misappropriation averred in the information [6, 7]. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed [7].
