I. CAPTION
MORCOIN CO., LTD. and SUTER, INC. v. THE CITY OF MANILA, THE MAYOR OF MANILA, THE CITY TREASURER and THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-15351, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Morcoin Co., Ltd. and Suter, Inc. were owners and operators of automatic phonograph machines (juke boxes) in Manila [1]. They previously paid an annual permit fee of P5.00 and a license fee of P50.00 per machine [1]. In an effort to curb the use of pinball machines believed to contribute to moral delinquency, the Municipal Board of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 3628, amending Sections 773 and 774 of Ordinance No. 1600 [2, 3]. The new ordinance imposed an annual license fee of P300.00 for the installation and use of coin-operated contrivances, including juke boxes [3, 4]. Petitioners filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to declare the ordinance void, arguing the fee was exorbitant, confiscatory, and substantially disproportionate to the expenses of regulation [5]. The CFI rendered judgment declaring Ordinance No. 3628 null and void [6]. The City of Manila appealed to the Supreme Court [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 3628 imposing an annual license fee of P300.00 on juke boxes is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Court affirmed the decision of the lower court declaring the ordinance invalid.

The Court held that the legislative power of the Municipal Board under Section 18 of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila (R.A. No. 409) "to regulate and fix the license fees for... slot machines" is purely regulatory for police purposes and does not include the power to tax for revenue [6]. As such, the amount of license fees must be approximately commensurate with the necessary expenses for issuing the license and for lawful inspection, regulation, and supervision [8]. Any ordinance imposing a fee substantially in excess of these reasonable expenses is invalid (*Pacific Commercial Co. v. Romualdez*; *Cu Unjieng v. Patstone*) [6, 8].

In this case, the P300.00 fee was found to be unreasonable, prohibitory, and suppressive [9]. It far exceeded the expenses of regulation, particularly since the ordinance did not even provide for the inspection and supervision of the machines [9]. Furthermore, evidence showed that the annual net income of a juke box was only about P211.00, making the P300.00 fee confiscatory [10]. Unlike pinball machines which are gambling devices, the operation of juke boxes was deemed a useful, legitimate, and harmless occupation [11, 12].

Decision affirmed [13].
