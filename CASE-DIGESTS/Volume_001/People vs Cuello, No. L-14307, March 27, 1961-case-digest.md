I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ICASIANO C. CUELLO, G.R. No. L-14307, March 27, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On April 20, 1955, Icasiano Cuello was charged in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila with violation of Article 277 of the Revised Penal Code for neglecting his children's education and support from 1950 to the present. Cuello moved to quash the information, arguing that the CFI lacked jurisdiction. He contended that because the penalty for the offense is *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500, the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court pursuant to Section 87(b) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 (R.A. 296). The CFI denied the motion, proceeded with the trial, and convicted Cuello. Cuello appealed to the Supreme Court, raising the jurisdictional question and assigning errors regarding the trial court's factual findings on the abandonment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the offense of abandonment of a minor punishable by *arresto mayor* and a fine not exceeding P500.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court of First Instance (CFI) has exclusive original jurisdiction. The penalty under Article 277 of the Revised Penal Code is composite: *arresto mayor* AND a fine not exceeding P500. Relying on *Angeles v. Jose*, the Court held that where the fine fixed by law is beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court (which was limited to fines not exceeding P200 at the time) but within that of the CFI, the latter has jurisdiction. The penalty cannot be split between two courts. Since the fine component exceeded the Municipal Court's limit, the CFI correctly took cognizance of the case.

However, because the jurisdictional issue raised was deemed "unsubstantial" and the appeal required a revision and determination of facts found by the trial court, the Supreme Court **REMANDED** the case to the Court of Appeals for determination.
