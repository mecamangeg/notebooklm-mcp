I. CAPTION
QUINTIN CHAN v. JUAN B. ESPE, G.R. No. L-16777, April 20, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On August 24, 1957, a house belonging to Juan B. Espe was sold at public auction to Quintin Chan, while the land remained Espe's property [1]. Espe failed to redeem the house within the one-year redemption period, resulting in the issuance of a certificate of definite sale to Chan on August 27, 1958 [1]. During this one-year period, the house was occupied by tenants, and Espe collected P2,304.00 in rentals [1, 2]. Chan demanded the surrender of these collected rentals, but Espe refused [1]. Chan filed a suit for collection in the Court of First Instance of La Union [3]. The trial court ruled in favor of Chan, ordering Espe to pay the collected rentals (deducting the rent due to Espe for the land) and fixing a period for the house's removal [4]. Espe appealed, arguing the purchaser is not entitled to possession or fruits during the redemption period.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the purchaser at a public auction is entitled to the rentals collected from tenants during the redemption period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court [5]. Under Section 30 of the Rules of Court regarding rents and profits pending redemption, the rule depends on who is in possession. If the judgment debtor is in possession, they are entitled to retain the property and its fruits [2, 6]. However, if the property is in the possession of a tenant, the purchaser is entitled to receive the rents or the reasonable value of its use and occupation [2, 7].

While the purchaser is accountable for these amounts if the judgment debtor redeems the property, this accountability is extinguished if redemption does not occur [2]. Since the house was leased to tenants and Espe failed to redeem the property within the period, Chan is solely entitled to the accrued rentals [2].

Decision affirmed [5].
