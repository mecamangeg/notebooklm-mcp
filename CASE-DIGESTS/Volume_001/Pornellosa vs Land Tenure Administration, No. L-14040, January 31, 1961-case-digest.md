I. CAPTION
SEGUNDA PORNELLOSA and JOSE ANGELES v. THE LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION and HERMINIO GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-14040, January 31, 1961, 1 SCRA 375, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
The Santa Clara Estate was acquired by the Government under Commonwealth Act No. 539 for resale to bona fide tenants or occupants. On April 1, 1941, petitioners Pornellosa and Angeles purchased the "rights of occupation" and a house standing on a lot within the estate from Vicenta San Jose, an old tenant [1, 2]. The transaction was evidenced by a private document (Exhibit A) titled "Dapat Mabatid ng Madla" [1]. Petitioners subsequently made payments to the government, evidenced by receipts which were marked "subject to further re-adjustment" and did not specify the lot number or area [3, 4].

Later, the estate was subdivided. The lot occupied by San Jose was split into Lot 44 and Lot 78. Lot 44 was sold by the government to respondent Herminio Guzman, while Lot 78 was assigned to petitioners [3]. Petitioners refused Lot 78, claiming they were entitled to the entire 200 square meters originally held by San Jose, including Lot 44 [3, 4]. They filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul the sale to Guzman and compel the Director of Lands (succeeded by the Land Tenure Administration) to execute a deed of sale for the disputed lot in their favor [5].

The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the decision and dismissed the complaint, finding that petitioners failed to prove the identity and area of the lot sold to them by San Jose and that they had no formal contract with the government for the specific lot [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners acquired the right to compel the government to sell them the subject land based on the private deed of sale executed by the previous occupant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. The Court held that a party claiming a right granted by law must prove their claim by competent evidence [7]. Petitioners failed to prove that Lot 44 was included in the area they purchased from San Jose, as the deed (Exhibit A) did not specify the area or boundaries of the lot [6, 7].

Furthermore, the Court ruled that the deed of sale executed by San Jose in favor of Pornellosa was a mere private document. While valid and binding regarding the sale of the house, "it is not sufficient to convey title or any right to the residential lot in litigation" [8]. Under Article 1358(1) of the Civil Code (and Article 1280(1) of the old Civil Code), acts and contracts which have for their object the creation, transmission, modification, or extinguishment of real rights over immovable property must appear in a public document [8]. Consequently, petitioners failed to establish their right to acquire Lot 44 and cannot compel the Land Tenure Administration to convey it to them.

Judgment affirmed.
