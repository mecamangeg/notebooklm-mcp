I. CAPTION
LVN PICTURES, INC. and SAMPAGUITA PICTURES, INC. v. PHILIPPINE MUSICIANS GUILD (FFW) and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. Nos. L-12582 and L-12598, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The Philippine Musicians Guild (FFW) filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be certified as the sole bargaining agency for all musicians working with LVN Pictures, Inc. and Sampaguita Pictures, Inc. The film companies opposed the petition, denying the existence of an employer-employee relationship. They alleged that the musicians were independent contractors engaged by musical directors, who agreed on a price for the music, hired their own men, and paid them.

The CIR found that while musical directors were involved, the film companies exercised control over the musicians. Specifically, the companies summoned musicians via "call slips," provided studios, transportation, and meals. Crucially, during recording sessions, the movie directors (employees of the companies) supervised the musicians in detail, directing their performance to suit the film. The CIR ruled that the musicians were employees and certified the Guild. The companies appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction to entertain a certification petition when the employer-employee relationship is contested.
2. W/N an employer-employee relationship exists between the film companies and the musicians.
3. W/N the musicians constitute a proper bargaining unit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the CIR can entertain a petition for certification if, after due hearing, the parties are found to have an employer-employee relationship. The mere contest of the relationship does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of the petition [1].

2. **YES.** The Court applied the "right of control" test, stating that an employer-employee relationship exists where the person for whom services are performed reserves the right to control not only the end to be achieved but also the means to be used in reaching such end [2, 3]. The Court found that the film companies exercised this control by: (1) summoning musicians through call slips in the company's name; (2) arranging recording schedules; (3) furnishing transportation and meals; and (4) supervising the performance in detail through the movie directors [4]. The intervention of the musical director was not sufficient to negate this relationship, as the movie director—an employee of the company—ultimately directed the musicians' work to ensure it integrated with the motion picture [5].

3. **YES.** The Court held that the musicians constitute a proper bargaining unit because their work is distinct from that of other employees in the film companies, and the peculiar circumstances of their service justify a separate unit [6]. The CIR enjoys wide discretion in determining the appropriate bargaining unit, and its judgment is entitled to finality unless arbitrary or capricious [7].

The order of the Court of Industrial Relations is AFFIRMED.
