I. CAPTION
DIOSDADO C. TY v. FIRST NATIONAL SURETY & ASSURANCE CO., INC., et al., G.R. Nos. L-16138-45, April 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Diosdado C. Ty, a mechanic foreman, insured himself with 18 local insurance companies, including the respondents [1]. The personal accident policies provided indemnity for "Partial Disability," specifically P650.00 for the "Loss of Either Hand." The policies expressly defined such loss: "The loss of a hand shall mean the loss by amputation through the bones of the wrist" [2, 3].

On December 24, 1953, a fire destroyed Ty's workplace. While escaping, he was injured by a heavy object, suffering fractures to the index, middle, and fourth fingers of his left hand [4]. These injuries caused the "temporary total disability" of his left hand, but no amputation was performed [5, 6]. Ty filed claims which the respondents rejected because there was no severance or amputation [3]. The Municipal Court and the Court of First Instance dismissed Ty's complaints [3]. Ty appealed, arguing that for the purpose of the policy, the inability to perform work should constitute "total disability" regardless of amputation [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ty can recover indemnity for the loss of his left hand under the insurance policies despite the absence of amputation.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Ty cannot recover. The insurance contract is the law between the parties [8, 9]. The terms of the policies are clear, express, and specific in defining "partial disability" regarding the hand as "loss of either hand by *amputation* through the bones of the wrist" [6].

The Court emphasized that while it sympathized with the petitioner, it could not go beyond the clear conditions of the policies. Since the trial court found only "temporary total disability" caused by fractures and no amputation occurred, an interpretation extending coverage to mere fractures would be unwarranted [6, 9].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed.
