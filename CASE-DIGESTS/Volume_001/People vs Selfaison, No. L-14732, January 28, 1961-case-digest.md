I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JOSEFINO G. SELFAISON, NEMESIO DALISAY, DOMINGO URETA and BERNARDO BAUTISTA, G.R. No. L-14732, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
On April 7, 1954, complainants Angelita Sinag (16) and Angelina Maghibon (19) boarded a passenger truck in New Washington, Capiz, driven by accused Josefino Selfaison, with accused Nemesio Dalisay as conductor and Bernardo Bautista as helper [1, 2]. At barrio Ondoy, Selfaison picked up four men, including accused Domingo Ureta [1, 2]. Later, at an isolated place called *sitio* Pulang Data, Selfaison stopped the truck. The accused dragged the girls away. Selfaison raped Angelita and robbed her of P200 and goods from her trunk. The other accused also took turns raping the complainants [3, 4].

Medical examinations revealed lacerations and contusions but no spermatozoa [5-7]. The Court of First Instance of Capiz convicted Selfaison of robbery with rape and the other three appellants of rape only [8]. The accused appealed, alleging alibi, the lack of spermatozoa as evidence of no rape, and deprivation of their right to preliminary investigation [7, 9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the victims' identification.
2. W/N the absence of spermatozoa in the medical examination precludes a conviction for rape.
3. W/N the accused were deprived of their right to preliminary investigation.
4. W/N the co-accused are also liable for robbery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by the offended parties [11]. The victims knew Selfaison and the truck personnel previously or had ample opportunity to observe them during the trip and the commission of the crime [12].

2. **NO.** The absence of spermatozoa does not mean rape was not committed; the slightest penetration suffices to consummate the crime [11, 13]. The victims likely washed themselves to avoid conception [7, 11]. Furthermore, a medical examination is not always necessary in rape cases; the sole testimony of the offended party, if credible, is sufficient to sustain a conviction [14-16]. The lacerations and contusions proved the act was done with force and violence [7].

3. **NO.** The accused waived their right to preliminary investigation when they posted bail immediately after arrest and proceeded to trial without raising the issue [10, 17, 18].

4. **NO.** There was no showing that the other accused conspired with Selfaison to commit the robbery; they only participated in the rape [18, 19]. Thus, Selfaison alone is guilty of robbery with rape (aggravated by nocturnity and use of a motor vehicle), while the others are guilty only of rape [20].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the accused are sentenced to indemnify each victim in the sum of P5,000 [21, 22].
