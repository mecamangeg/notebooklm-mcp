I. CAPTION
CASIANO IGNACIO, ET AL. v. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, G.R. No. L-16131, March 27, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On September 11, 1959, petitioners Casiano Ignacio and others filed a joint certificate of candidacy for the position of municipal councilor of Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur. On October 6, 1959, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) refused to give due course to the certificate on the ground that it was subscribed under oath only by the party president and not also by the secretary, in violation of Section 35 of the Election Code [1]. Upon petitioners' application, the Supreme Court issued a preliminary injunction on October 29, 1959, ordering the COMELEC to distribute the certificates for the November 10, 1959 elections [2]. The elections were held as scheduled, resulting in the election of some petitioners while others were not elected [2]. Petitioners subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the case [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the case should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court found the motion to dismiss well-founded. The issue involved became academic because the elections had already been held on November 10, 1959, and the results determined that some petitioners were elected to office while others were not [2, 3]. Consequently, the Court dismissed the action without costs [4].
