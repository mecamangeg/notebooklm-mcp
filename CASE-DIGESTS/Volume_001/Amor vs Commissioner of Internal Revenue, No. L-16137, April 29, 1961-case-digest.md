I. CAPTION
VIRGINIA AMOR, et al. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-16137, April 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, employed as pharmacists and registered nurses, paid occupation taxes for the year 1958 [1]. They subsequently filed a claim for refund, arguing they were exempt under Section 182(C)(1) of the Tax Code, which exempts persons whose "gross monthly sales or receipts do not exceed two hundred pesos" [2]. Petitioners contended that the term "receipts" in the provision includes salaries, and since their monthly salaries were below P200.00, they should be exempt [2]. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied the refund [1]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the denial, ruling that the exemption cited applies to business taxes, not occupation taxes, and that "receipts" refers to business earnings, not salaries [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners are exempt from occupation tax under Section 182(C)(1) of the Tax Code because their gross monthly salaries do not exceed P200.00.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the exemption in Section 182(C)(1) applies only to fixed taxes on businesses described in Paragraph A of the section, not to the occupation tax described in Paragraph B [4, 5]. The word "receipts" was added to the statute to cover businesses under "Other fixed taxes" (e.g., brokers, agents) that generate income but do not involve "sales" [4].

The specific exemption for occupation tax is found in Section 182(C)(7), which applies to professionals employed in the government or in religious, educational, or charitable institutions not conducted for private gain [5]. Since petitioners were not employed by such institutions, they are not entitled to the exemption [5]. Furthermore, tax exemptions are highly disfavored and must be justified by a clear grant of law [6]. The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [7].
