**I. CAPTION**
MANILA TRADING & SUPPLY COMPANY v. THE HONORABLE EDUARDO D. ENRIQUEZ and SOCORRO ZAYCO, G.R. No. L-12836, April 26, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Manila Trading & Supply Company was a claimant in the testate estate proceedings of Lorenzo Zayco and Flora Rubin, presided over by respondent Judge Enriquez [1]. On November 23, 1956, the trial court approved a plenary project of partition submitted by the administratrix (respondent Zayco), which excluded the petitioner. This order was appealed to the Court of Appeals [2].

While the appeal was pending, the administratrix resubmitted a "Partial Project of Partition and Declaration of Heirs" dated June 24, 1956, for court approval [2]. Petitioner opposed this, arguing that the approval of the plenary project was tantamount to a denial of the partial project and that the court had lost jurisdiction due to the perfected appeal [3, 4]. On June 10, 1957, the trial court overruled the opposition and approved the partial project [5]. Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) on July 8, 1957, reiterating that the court lost jurisdiction to consider the partial partition because the plenary partition was already on appeal [4-6]. The trial court treated the MR as *pro forma*, refused to give due course to the appeal, and disapproved the record on appeal. Petitioner filed a petition for *mandamus* [1, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was *pro forma*, failing to interrupt the period for filing the record on appeal.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Motion for Reconsideration was not *pro forma*. The motion alleged a specific and distinct legal ground for setting aside the order: that the court *a quo* had lost jurisdiction to consider the partial project of partition because the plenary project of partition had already been approved and was currently on appeal [6]. Because the motion was not *pro forma*, it effectively interrupted the reglementary period for filing the record on appeal [7, 8]. Consequently, the trial court erred in refusing to approve the record on appeal. *Mandamus* lies to compel the trial court to elevate the record on appeal when the appeal is perfected on time [7].

**Petition granted.** The lower court was ordered to forward the record on appeal, and the preliminary injunction was made permanent [6].
