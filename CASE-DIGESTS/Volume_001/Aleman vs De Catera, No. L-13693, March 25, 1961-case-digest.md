I. CAPTION
FLORENTINA ALEMAN, ET AL. v. PRESENTACION DE CATERA, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-13693 and L-13694, March 25, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On January 21, 1954, a passenger truck owned by Presentacion De Catera and driven by Marianito Amborgo fell into a ditch in Iloilo due to overspeeding, killing passengers Antonio Real, Jose Ontanillas, and Zosimo Montefrio, and injuring Florentina Aleman [1, 2]. The victims and their heirs filed separate civil actions for damages against De Catera [1, 2]. A writ of attachment was issued against another bus owned by De Catera, known as "Catera No. 4" [2].

Southern Motors, Inc. intervened, claiming a preferred right over the attached bus. Southern Motors alleged that it had sold the bus to one Wenceslao Defensor on installment, secured by a chattel mortgage registered in the Registry of Deeds [3]. However, Defensor sold the bus to De Catera, and this sale was recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office [3]. The chattel mortgage in favor of Southern Motors was not recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding damages and dismissing Southern Motors' counterclaim [5, 6]. Southern Motors appealed, arguing its registered mortgage should prevail over the judgment creditors' attachment [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a chattel mortgage over a motor vehicle registered in the Registry of Deeds but not recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office is binding on third persons.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A chattel mortgage over a motor vehicle, to be binding upon third persons, must be registered in the Chattel Mortgage Registry of the Registry of Deeds AND recorded in the corresponding Motor Vehicles Office as required by Section 5(e) of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law [4, 8].

A chattel mortgage over a vehicle not recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office cannot prevail over the sale of the same vehicle which was duly recorded in the Motor Vehicles Office [4, 8]. Consequently, Southern Motors' unrecorded mortgage claim is not preferred over the attachment by the plaintiffs who are judgment creditors of the registered owner [3, 7].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the intervenor-appellant Southern Motors, Inc. [9].
