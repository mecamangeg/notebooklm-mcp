I. CAPTION
COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. UNIVERSITY OF THE VISAYAS, G.R. No. L-13554, February 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed respondent University of the Visayas (UV) for income tax for the years 1946 to 1950 in the total sum of P46,592.03. UV, a corporation operating an educational institution, paid P13,811.31 in installments under protest but subsequently filed an action for a refund. UV claimed exemption from income tax under Section 27(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). The CIR contended that UV is not exempt because it is a stock corporation, charges tuition fees, and its assets would be distributed to stockholders upon dissolution. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of UV, holding it exempt and ordering the refund of taxes paid within the prescriptive period. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court for review.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent University is exempt from income tax under Section 27(e) of the National Internal Revenue Code despite being a stock corporation that charges fees.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CTA's decision. Under Section 27(e) of the NIRC, a corporation is exempt if it is organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes and no part of its net income inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.

The Court held that the mere realization of profits from operation does not result in the loss of exemption. The fact that UV charges tuition fees does not make it a profit-making enterprise, as fees are necessary for its existence and maintenance. Furthermore, the amendment of UV's articles of incorporation from a non-stock to a stock corporation is not conclusive proof that it is engaged in business for profit; Section 27(e) makes no distinction between stock and non-stock corporations.

The crucial test is whether net income inures to private stockholders. The evidence showed that since its incorporation, UV never declared dividends and its net income was used for school improvements, equipment, and surplus. The payment of salaries to officers and teachers is remuneration for services, not a distribution of profit. Finally, the possibility that assets may be distributed to stockholders upon dissolution is a contingency too remote to negate the exemption.

The petition was denied, and the judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals was affirmed.
