I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED AS CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. GELACIO LO CHICOMBING v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14865, March 27, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On November 23, 1957, Gelacio Lo Chicombing filed a petition for naturalization, stating his occupation was a medical student at the University of the Philippines [1]. This matched his declaration of intention filed in 1956 [2]. However, during the hearing on October 22, 1958, he testified that he was actually a purchasing agent for his brother and one Ong Chiao in Daet, earning a combined monthly salary of P120.00 [2]. He also claimed to have a dried fish business capitalized at P4,000.00 since April 1958 [2]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Norte admitted him as a citizen [1]. The Solicitor General appealed, arguing the petitioner lacked the required lucrative occupation [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner has a lucrative lawful occupation to qualify for naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner failed to prove he possessed a known lucrative lawful occupation as required by Section 2(4) of the Revised Naturalization Law [3]. Even accepting his testimony, his monthly income as a purchasing agent was only P120.00 [3]. While he claimed to have a dried fish business with quarterly gross sales of P1,154.40, he presented no evidence of his monthly net earnings [3]. Furthermore, he failed to prove the source of his P4,000.00 capital, considering his low monthly income [3].

The decision of the Court of First Instance is REVERSED [4].
