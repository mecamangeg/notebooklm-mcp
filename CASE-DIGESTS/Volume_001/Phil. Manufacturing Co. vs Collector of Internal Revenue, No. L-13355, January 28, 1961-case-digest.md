I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-13355, January 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC) engaged Smith Sound Systems Laboratories to produce cinematographic films showing the use of its products, such as "Lava" soap and "Purico" lard, and associating its "Star Margarine" with recreational activities [1]. The films were exhibited free of charge to the public [2]. The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue assessed specific taxes on these films, which PMC contested, claiming exemption under Section 146 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) on the ground that they were "educational films or cinematographic films used for visual education" [2].

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that the films were subject to specific tax, finding that while they contained some educational value, their primary purpose was to advertise PMC's products [3, 4]. PMC appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the films provided instructions on health and nutrition and were thus educational [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cinematographic films produced for PMC are exempt from specific tax as "educational films" under Section 146 of the NIRC.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [6]. The Court held that to be exempt from the specific tax under Section 146 of the NIRC, the films must be "educational films or cinematographic films used for visual education" [1].

The Court found that the main purpose of the films was to advertise PMC's products, and whatever educational value they conveyed was merely incidental to this commercial purpose [7]. PMC is a corporation organized for profit, not a civic institution, and used the films as a medium of modern advertising to promote its soap and lard products [7]. The Court reasoned that accepting PMC's argument—that any film conveying a lesson is educational—would result in an absurd interpretation of the law, as even commercial films have some educational value [7]. Finally, the Court established that in determining whether films are educational, the circumstances and purposes of the entity manufacturing or importing them must be considered [8].

The judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed.
