**I. CAPTION**
MARIANO CONDE v. THE NATIONAL TOBACCO CORPORATION and THE BOARD OF LIQUIDATORS, G.R. No. L-11985, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Mariano Conde held various positions in the National Tobacco Corporation (NTC) starting in 1940. By November 1946, he was appointed Treasurer and Credit Manager with an annual salary of P7,200 [1, 2]. On December 21, 1948, pursuant to Board Resolution No. 265 which aimed to standardize the salaries of department chiefs, Conde was issued a document termed an "appointment" as Treasurer with a reduced salary of P6,000 per annum, effective December 16, 1948 [2]. This change relieved him of his duties as Credit Manager and Secretary of the Board [2]. After NTC was dissolved, Conde sought reconsideration from the Board of Liquidators but was denied [3]. Upon retiring in 1952, he filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to recover salary differentials, arguing that the 1948 "appointment" reducing his salary was invalid because it lacked the Presidential approval required for NTC positions with salaries over P3,000 [3, 4]. The CFI dismissed the complaint [1].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the 1948 document reducing the petitioner's salary required Presidential approval to be valid.
2. W/N the approval of the corporation's budget by the Government Enterprises Council constituted Presidential approval.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the document was not a true "appointment" but a mere notice of reduction in duties and salary [4]. Legally, an "appointment" is equivalent to "filling a vacancy" [5]. Conde never vacated his position as Treasurer; his duties were simply reduced (removing Credit Manager functions) to standardize his rank with other department chiefs [5, 6]. While Presidential approval was required for appointments involving additional expenditures or salary increases, there was no showing that this policy applied to salary reductions [7].

2. **YES.** Even if Presidential approval were required, there was substantial compliance [8]. The reduced salary was included in the NTC's Operation Budget, which was approved by the Control Committee of the Government Enterprises Council (GEC) [8]. Under Executive Order No. 93, the GEC acts as the President's representative in supervising government-owned corporations [8]. Consequently, the GEC's approval of the budget was tantamount to an act done on behalf of the President himself [8].

**Decision affirmed.**

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None.
