I. CAPTION
QUIRINO DUMLAO, POINCAIRE ABDON, MODESTO DE LOS REYES, LEONOR DE JESUS, and FELIX ABDON v. HON. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN, AMBROSIO FARRALES, et al., G.R. No. L-12816, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Epifanio Farrales filed a forcible entry and detainer case against petitioners Quirino Dumlao et al. in the Justice of the Peace Court of San Narciso, Zambales. The court dismissed the complaint and ordered Epifanio to surrender possession of the land to petitioners [1]. Following the finality of the decision, a writ of execution was issued, and petitioners were restored to the possession of the land [2]. Subsequently, private respondents Ambrosio Farrales et al., claiming to be tenants designated by Epifanio, filed a petition for reinstatement with damages against petitioners in the Court of Industrial Relations (later transferred to the Court of Agrarian Relations) [3]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) ruled in favor of private respondents, declaring them illegally dispossessed and ordering their reinstatement, reasoning that they were tenants entitled to security of tenure [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing that private respondents were tenants of an ejected squatter [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N tenants installed by a squatter are entitled to security of tenure under the Tenancy Law.
2. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over the case.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the security of tenure guaranteed by the Tenancy Law (Republic Act No. 1199) may be invoked only by tenants *de jure* and not by those who are not true and lawful tenants but became so only through the acts of a supposed landholder who had no right to the landholdings [5]. Since Epifanio Farrales was ejected by a final judgment and deemed an unlawful squatter and intruder, he could not validly constitute private respondents as tenants [4, 5]. Under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 1199, tenancy relations can only be created with the consent of the true landholder, who is either the owner, lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor [5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that because there was no valid tenancy relation between the private respondents and the petitioners (the true landholders), the Agrarian Court acquired no jurisdiction over the case [5].

The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations was REVERSED [6].
