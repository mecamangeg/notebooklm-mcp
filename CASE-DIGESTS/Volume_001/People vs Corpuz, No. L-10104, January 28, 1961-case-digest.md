I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEVERINO CORPUZ and LUIS ARDANIEL, G.R. No. L-10104, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of May 2, 1952, in La Paz, Abra, Antonio Castañeda and his family were awakened by two armed men who demanded food and robbed them of P130.00 in cash and jewelry worth P140.00 [1]. The victim’s wife, Carmen, recognized one intruder as Severino Corpuz, while the daughter, Aniceta, identified the other as Luis Ardaniel, a former schoolmate [1]. Ardaniel attempted to abuse Aniceta, and when Antonio intervened verbally, Ardaniel and Corpuz shot him, resulting in his death [1], [2]. The Court of First Instance of Abra convicted both accused of Robbery with Homicide [3], [4]. Both appealed, but Corpuz's appeal was dismissed, leaving Ardaniel as the sole appellant [1]. Ardaniel raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was playing the trumpet in a band in another barrio during the crime [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the guilt of appellant Ardaniel was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite his defense of alibi.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the defense of alibi cannot overcome the positive identification by credible prosecution witnesses [5]. The Court found that the witnesses, being the wife and daughter of the deceased, had no motive to indiscriminately point to the wrong parties and were solely interested in justice [6]. Their prompt identification of the accused precluded bad faith [6]. The Court ruled the crime to be Robbery with Homicide under Article 294, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code [4]. Although the crime was attended by the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and treachery, the penalty imposed was *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of necessary votes for the death penalty [7]. The decision appealed from is affirmed [7], [8].
