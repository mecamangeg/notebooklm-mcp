I. CAPTION
PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS SYSTEM (PHILIPPINES) v. PAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, G.R. No. L-16275, February 23, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
The respondent union filed a case (Case No. 1055-V) in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) claiming overtime compensation for fourteen aircraft mechanics and two communication employees [1, 2]. These employees were still in the service of the petitioner company at the time the petition was filed [3]. The core of the dispute was the one-hour meal period: the petitioner claimed it was a rest period, while the union argued the employees were required to stand by for emergency work during that time [4]. The CIR ruled in favor of the union, declaring the meal period (less 15 minutes for eating) as compensable overtime work and ordering the company to adopt a straight 8-hour shift [2, 5]. The CIR also directed the Chief of its Examining Division to compute the overtime pay due based on time sheets [2]. Petitioner appealed by certiorari, questioning the CIR's jurisdiction over money claims, the factual finding regarding the meal period, and the authority to delegate the computation of pay [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has jurisdiction over the claim for overtime pay.
2. W/N the one-hour meal period constitutes compensable overtime work.
3. W/N the CIR's order for the Examining Division to compute the overtime pay constitutes an undue delegation of judicial functions.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction over claims for overtime pay when the claimants are still in the service of the employer at the time of the petition, or if separated, are seeking reinstatement [3]. The Court held that since the employees claiming overtime compensation were undeniably still in the service of the company when the case was filed, the jurisdiction of the CIR is proper and cannot be assailed [3].

2. **YES.** The meal period is considered overtime work when it is not one of complete rest [6, 7]. The Court found substantial evidence that during the so-called meal period, the mechanics were required to stand by for emergency work, were reprimanded by the leadman if unavailable, and were frequently called from their meals to perform tasks [4]. Consequently, the order to adopt a straight 8-hour shift including the meal period was proper [7].

3. **NO.** The computation of overtime pay involves, at most, a mechanical function, and assigning this task to the Chief of the Examining Division does not constitute an undue delegation of judicial functions [8, 9]. The Court reasoned that the examiner's report is still subject to the Industrial Court's approval [9]. Furthermore, the absence of a specific monetary amount in the decision does not render it incomplete, as this matter is clarified during implementation [9].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [10].
