I. CAPTION
LAUREANA A. CID v. IRENE P. JAVIER, et al., G.R. No. L-14116, January 20, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Laureana Cid was constructing a building with a wall situated one (1) meter from the property boundary. Respondents Irene Javier, et al. owned an adjacent house, reconstructed in 1946, which stood only 50 centimeters from the same boundary line. Consequently, the eaves of the two buildings overlapped by 24 centimeters. The lower court and the Court of Appeals found this overlapping violative of Laoag Municipal Ordinance No. 3 (series of 1909), which mandates a distance of two (2) meters between the eaves of adjoining strong-material buildings [1]. Based on this violation, the lower court issued a preliminary injunction stopping the petitioner's construction [2]. The Supreme Court, in a decision promulgated on June 30, 1960, lifted the injunction. Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the final finding of an ordinance violation justified maintaining the injunction [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the injunction against the petitioner should be maintained due to the violation of the municipal ordinance regarding eaves distance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court denied the Motion for Reconsideration. The Municipal Ordinance in question was already in force when respondents reconstructed their house in 1946 [3]. Had the respondents observed a one-meter distance from the boundary—similar to the setback observed by the petitioner—there would have been no overlapping of eaves and no violation of the ordinance [3]. The resulting violation cannot be attributed solely to the petitioner, nor should she alone be required to make adjustments. If compliance with the two-meter eaves-to-eaves distance were to be exacted, adjustments would be required from both parties [3]. Therefore, there is no justification for maintaining the injunction directed exclusively against the petitioner's construction [3].

Motion for reconsideration denied [4].
