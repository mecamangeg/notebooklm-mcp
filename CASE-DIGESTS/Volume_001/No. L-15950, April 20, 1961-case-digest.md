I. CAPTION
GERVACIO DAUZ v. HON. FELIPE T. ELEOSIDA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-15950, April 20, 1961, [Ponente not indicated in source].

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gervacio Dauz was charged with a violation of an ordinance [1]. He filed a motion to quash before the Justice of the Peace Court, arguing that the facts did not constitute a criminal offense because he had paid the fees for the first quarter of 1958, and thus the government’s remedy should be a civil action for collection rather than criminal prosecution [2]. The Justice of the Peace denied the motion [2]. Dauz then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) [2]. The CFI, presided by Judge Juan A. Sarenas, dismissed the petition, holding that Dauz's remedy was to proceed to trial and appeal if convicted [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for certiorari and prohibition is the proper remedy against an order denying a motion to quash.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that when a motion to quash is denied, the defendant's proper remedy is to go to trial on the merits and, if convicted, to appeal from the judgment [3]. Certiorari and prohibition do not lie where the remedy of appeal is available [4]. The Court noted that the Justice of the Peace Court had exclusive original jurisdiction over the offense because the penalty prescribed by the ordinance (fine not exceeding P200.00 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months) fell within its jurisdiction under Republic Act No. 296, Section 87 [1]. Dauz's defense regarding payment is a matter of evidence to be proven during the trial [1]. The decision dismissing Dauz's petition is affirmed, with costs [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, and Dizon concurred [4]. Justice Paredes took no part [4].
