I. CAPTION
DOROTEA CONFESOR, ET AL. v. HON. PANTALEON PELAYO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14352, March 27, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On March 29, 1952, respondents Deogracias Umadhay, et al. filed an action for partition of Lot No. 3570 against petitioners Dorotea Confesor, et al. [1]. Petitioners claimed exclusive ownership, but the trial court rejected this and ordered the land divided equally [2]. The court-appointed commissioner submitted two plans, and the trial court adopted Plan No. 1, adjudicating Lot No. 1 to respondents and Lot No. 2 to petitioners [2]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto* [3]. After the judgment became final, the trial court issued a writ of execution ordering respondents to be placed in possession of their allotted lot [3]. Petitioners objected, arguing that the decision was silent regarding delivery of possession and that they had improvements on the land for which they should be indemnified [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court may issue a writ of execution ordering delivery of possession to the prevailing party even if the judgment of partition does not expressly provide for it.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that delivery is a necessary and indispensable incident to carry into full effect the purpose of partition, which is to end co-ownership and vest in each joint owner a sole estate in specific property [4, 5]. Under Section 11, Rule 71 (now Rule 69) of the Rules of Court, the judgment states definitively the portion assigned to each party, and the effect is to vest in each party the portion of the real estate to them [5]. It would be "illusory and absurd" to have a partition if the same could not be carried out through execution and delivery [5, 6].

Regarding the improvements, the Court held that the commissioner is presumed to have already taken into account the value of improvements (houses and crops) when weighing equities as prescribed by Section 4, Rule 71 [7]. The Court also noted the CA's observation that the houses claimed by petitioners were actually located in Lot No. 2, which was adjudicated to them [7].

Petition denied [8].
