I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIA MAYDIN, G.R. Nos. L-15381 and L-15382, April 26, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On February 23, 1956, Maria Maydin was an outgoing passenger on a Philippine Air Lines plane bound for Hong Kong [1]. During inspection at the Manila International Airport, she declared possessing only $100 and ₱100. However, a Customs examiner discovered ₱400 in her handbag and a false bottom in her overnight kit [1]. Upon opening the kit in the presence of authorities and her husband, it was found to conceal ₱10,800 and $40 [2]. Maydin had no license to carry said amounts, in violation of Central Bank (CB) Circular Nos. 42 and 60 in relation to Republic Act No. 265 [3].

The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted Maydin in two criminal cases, sentencing her to imprisonment and fines, and ordering the forfeiture of the currency [4]. Maydin appealed, questioning the validity of the CB Circulars and the forfeiture [5]. The Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court as it raised only questions of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Central Bank must declare the existence of an "exchange crisis" before exercising its powers under R.A. No. 265.
2. W/N CB Circular Nos. 42 and 60 are valid despite lacking specific Presidential approval.
3. W/N the forfeiture of the seized currency was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Central Bank need not declare the existence of an exchange crisis before it can exercise the powers granted to it by Republic Act No. 265 [6]. It is sufficient that the power be exercised to carry out the purposes and aims declared in the law [6]. The Court cited prior jurisprudence (e.g., *People v. Jollife*) upholding the validity of circulars promulgated without such prior declaration [6].

2. **YES.** CB Circular No. 20 was approved by the President, and subsequent circulars like Nos. 42 and 60 do not require separate Presidential approval because they merely implement Circular No. 20 [7].

3. **YES.** The forfeiture was legal because the bills found in Maydin's possession were presented in evidence and were under the control of the trial court [8]. This is distinguished from *People v. Lim Ho*, where forfeiture was disallowed because the seized items were subject to separate administrative proceedings and not introduced as evidence in the criminal trial [8].

The judgments appealed from are **AFFIRMED** [9].
