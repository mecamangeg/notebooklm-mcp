I. CAPTION
NG LIAM KENG *alias* JOSE TANGCONKONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14146, April 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ng Liam Keng filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, supported by character witnesses Narciso Peña (a lawyer) and Ramon L. Echem (a businessman) [1]. The trial court dismissed the petition on several grounds: (1) failure to prove Chinese laws grant reciprocity to Filipinos; (2) the certificate of arrival was deemed not authentic because it lacked the specific date and month of arrival; (3) violation of the Alias Law; (4) deficient knowledge of the national language and English; and (5) discrepancies regarding his children’s surnames [1-4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing specifically that proof of Chinese law is unnecessary and that his certificate of arrival, issued by the Bureau of Immigration stating he arrived in 1919, should be accepted [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is qualified for admission as a citizen of the Philippines.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition, although it rejected some of the lower court's findings.

First, the Court ruled in favor of the petitioner regarding the documentary requirements, holding that proof of specific Chinese laws on reciprocity is not necessary; it is sufficient to submit proof of citizenship of Nationalist China [5]. Furthermore, the certificate of arrival is deemed authentic even without a specific month or day, as it was issued by the Bureau of Immigration and expressly stated an arrival year of 1919 [5].

However, the petition was denied on the following substantial grounds:
1.  **Language Proficiency:** The petitioner showed deficient knowledge in writing the national language and English. During trial, he demonstrated a "brazen inability" to translate and write a sentence from an English magazine into Tagalog [6].
2.  **Violation of Alias Law:** The petitioner violated the *Alias Law* (Commonwealth Act No. 142) and the court order authorizing his alias. Instead of using his real name and alias jointly, he used them interchangeably in business transactions, giving rise to suspicion of improper design [7].
3.  **Character Witnesses:** The witnesses failed to establish they knew the petitioner sufficiently well to act as "insurers of his moral character." Witness Peña only knew him briefly as counsel and through occasional store visits, while witness Echem was merely a neighbor for five years (1940-1945) without close association [8, 9].

Accordingly, the decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED** [9].
