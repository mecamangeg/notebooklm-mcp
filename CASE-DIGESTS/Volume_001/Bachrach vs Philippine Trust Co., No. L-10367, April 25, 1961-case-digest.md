I. CAPTION
MARY McD. BACHRACH v. PHILIPPINE TRUST CO. and LA ORDEN DE PP. BENEDICTINOS DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS, G.R. No. L-10367, April 25, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
La Orden de PP. Benedictinos (La Orden) issued bonds guaranteed by a Mortgage-Deed of Trust with Philippine Trust Co. (PTC) as Trustee. Appellant Bachrach purchased several bonds. Upon La Orden's default, and at the request of bondholders holding the required majority, PTC instituted an action for collection and foreclosure in 1941. A Receiver was appointed and authorized to sell the mortgaged properties. In June 1944, the properties were sold for P900,000, paid partly in Japanese military notes. The proceeds were turned over to PTC in full payment of the bonds and interests. PTC executed a deed of cancellation of the mortgage and published notices for bondholders to collect their payments. Bachrach failed to collect. After Liberation, Executive Order No. 49 invalidated deposits made in Japanese military notes. Bachrach sued La Orden and PTC to recover the value of the bonds, claiming the payment to the Trustee was invalid and that PTC was negligent. The lower court absolved the defendants.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the payment made by La Orden to the Trustee in Japanese military notes validly discharged its obligation to the bondholders.
2. W/N the Trustee is liable for the loss resulting from the invalidation of the Japanese military notes.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that the obligation of La Orden was completely satisfied and discharged. Under the Deed of Trust, the Trustee had not only the right but the duty to institute the action for collection on behalf of the bondholders upon default. Consequently, when the proceeds from the court-approved sale were paid to the Receiver and delivered to the Trustee, La Orden fully complied with its obligation [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court applied the principle of *res perit domino suo* (the thing perishes with the owner). The ownership of the money deposited with the Trustee vested in the bondholders from the moment of its deposit. Therefore, when the deposit was voided by Executive Order No. 49, the loss must be borne by the bondholders [2]. Furthermore, the Trustee was not guilty of negligence or breach of trust; it acted in accordance with the Deed of Trust, properly executed the release of mortgage upon payment, and even published notices to bondholders to effect payment, which appellant failed to heed [3, 4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
