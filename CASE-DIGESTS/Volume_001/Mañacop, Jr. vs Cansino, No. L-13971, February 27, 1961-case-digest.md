I. CAPTION
CARLOS MAÑACOP, JR. v. FAUSTINO CANSINO, G.R. No. L-13971, February 27, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
The dispute involves a parcel of land in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, originally registered under Sabina Tomas (OCT No. 144) in 1914. Between 1920 and 1923, Tomas sold portions of the land to the spouses Cansino and spouses Ancheta. These buyers claimed the lots in cadastral proceedings and obtained their own Original Certificates of Title in 1925. The Cansinos subsequently bought the Anchetas' portion and consolidated ownership, maintaining continuous possession for over 30 years.

However, a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT No. 99) in the name of Sabina Tomas remained in existence. After her death in 1952, her heirs obtained a duplicate of TCT No. 99, executed an extrajudicial settlement, and sold the land to Benito Bringas. Bringas then sold it to petitioner Mañacop in 1956, who obtained TCT No. NT-20508. Mañacop filed an action for recovery of possession against Cansino. The trial court ruled in favor of Cansino, cancelling Mañacop’s title and declaring him not a purchaser in good faith because he had notice that the title was subject to the liabilities of heirs under Rule 74, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. Mañacop appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Mañacop is a purchaser in good faith entitled to ownership of the land.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. A purchaser of land who is aware of sufficient facts to induce a reasonably prudent man to inquire into the status of the title cannot legally claim the rights of a purchaser in good faith.

The records showed that nine months before purchasing the land, Mañacop visited the property and found Cansino in open, public, and adverse possession. Mañacop was even explicitly told by a certain Abdon that Cansino was cultivating the land. Having such knowledge, he was duty-bound to inquire further. Furthermore, by appealing directly to the Supreme Court—which has no jurisdiction over questions of fact—Mañacop waived the right to question the trial court’s factual finding that he was not a purchaser in good faith [1, 2].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED**.
