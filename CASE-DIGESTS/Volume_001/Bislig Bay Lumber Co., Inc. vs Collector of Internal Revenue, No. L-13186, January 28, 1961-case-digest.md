I. CAPTION
BISLIG BAY LUMBER COMPANY, INC. v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-13186, January 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
From June 14, 1951, to June 19, 1953, Petitioner Bislig Bay Lumber Company, Inc. shipped logs to buyers in Japan under terms "F.O.B. or C. & I. (Cost and Insurance), Bislig, Surigao" [1, 2]. The Respondent Collector of Internal Revenue assessed Petitioner for deficiency sales tax and surcharges amounting to P175,681.30 on these shipments [2, 3]. Petitioner contested the assessment, arguing that title to the logs passed to the buyers outside the Philippines—and was thus not subject to domestic sales tax—because it had a legal representative in Japan, the logs were consigned to the Petitioner/order, and drafts were attached to the bills of lading [4, 5].

The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) modified the assessment but affirmed the tax liability for the log shipments, ruling that ownership passed in the Philippines [2, 5]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the sales of logs to buyers in Japan under F.O.B. or C. & I. terms are subject to the domestic sales tax.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision. It held that ownership over the logs passed in the Philippines from the seller to the foreign buyers [1].

The Court rejected Petitioner's argument that retaining shipping documents or having a representative in Japan meant title passed abroad. Relying on *Misamis Lumber Co., Inc. v. Collector* and *Western Mindanao Lumber Development Co., Inc. v. Court of Tax Appeals* [6], the Court found that the buyers paid for freight and insurance, and the Petitioner endorsed bills of lading in blank to local banks where buyers had opened irrevocable letters of credit [5, 7]. The retention of the bills of lading and drafts were merely schemes to ensure the performance of obligations (security) under Article 1503 of the Civil Code, not to suspend the transfer of ownership [5]. Consequently, the sales were consummated in the Philippines and were subject to tax.

Judgment affirmed [8].
