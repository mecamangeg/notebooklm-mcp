I. CAPTION
JUAN P. GERENA, ET AL. v. CITY OF MANILA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16505, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants, operators of automatic phonograph machines known as "juke boxes," previously paid an annual license fee of P50.00 per machine under Ordinance No. 3374 [3]. On March 19, 1954, the Municipal Board of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 3628, which imposed a significantly higher annual license fee of P300.00 for every machine installed [4]. Plaintiffs requested the City Treasurer to hold enforcement in abeyance, but the request was denied [5]. Consequently, plaintiffs filed an action to declare Ordinance No. 3628 null and void, arguing the fee was exorbitant, excessive, and confiscatory [6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila upheld the validity of the ordinance [2, 7]. Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court as it involved only questions of law [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 3628 imposing a P300.00 license fee on juke boxes is valid. [7]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court declared Ordinance No. 3628 null and void. Relying on the ruling in the companion case *Morcoin Co., Ltd. v. City of Manila* (G.R. No. L-15351), the Court found the P300.00 license fee to be unreasonable as it far exceeded the expenses of issuing the license and regulating the machines [7, 8]. The ordinance failed to provide for inspection or supervision, and the Municipal Board's own committees admitted the fee was "prohibitory and suppressive," preventing operators from making a profit [7]. Evidence showed that some machines generated an annual income of only P211.00 before fees, making the P300.00 charge excessive and unjustified [7]. While ordinances are presumed valid, this presumption is set aside when the measure is shown to be unreasonable. The decision of the lower court was reversed [1, 7].
