I. CAPTION
OSMUNDO TAN *alias* MUNDO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-14861, March 17, 1961, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Osmundo Tan filed a petition for naturalization, which the Court of First Instance of Leyte granted. The Republic appealed the decision, challenging the petitioner's qualifications on moral grounds and financial capacity [1, 2].

The evidence showed that Tan had openly cohabited with a woman named Ludivina Geraldo in his house for several years without the benefit of marriage. Although he promised to marry her, he failed to fulfill this promise, and the Court found that her alleged employment as a salesgirl was merely a way to silence her and her family regarding their illicit relationship [3]. regarding his finances, Tan claimed to earn an average annual income of P1,500.00 working as a driver and copra buyer for his father, Tan Yu Chin [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner observed proper and irreproachable conduct during his residence in the Philippines.
2. W/N the petitioner possesses a known lucrative trade or lawful occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that openly cohabiting with a woman and maintaining illicit relations cannot be regarded as conducting oneself in a "proper and irreproachable manner" as required by Section 2, third subdivision of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) [3]. Citing *Yu Lo vs. Republic*, the Court emphasized that such public illicit relations disqualify a petitioner from naturalization [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an average yearly income of P1,500.00 is not sufficient to constitute a "known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation" under Section 2, fourth subdivision of Commonwealth Act No. 473 [4]. The Court considered the high cost of living, the low purchasing power of the currency, and the fact that the petitioner's employment was within his own father's business to conclude the evidence was insufficient [4].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DISMISSED** [5].
