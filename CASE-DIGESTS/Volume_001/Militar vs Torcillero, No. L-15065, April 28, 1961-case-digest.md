I. CAPTION
CESAR D. MILITAR v. VENTURA TORCILLERO and HON. RAMON BLANCO, G.R. No. L-15065, April 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Torcillero (tenant) filed a case for ejectment against Petitioner Militar (landlord) in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR). On August 31, 1956, the CAR rendered a decision declaring Torcillero's ejectment unjustified and ordering his reinstatement. The decision also expressly "reserved" to Torcillero the right to file a separate action for the recovery of damages. Militar did not appeal this decision, and it became final and executory [1].

Subsequently, Torcillero filed a new petition (CAR Case No. 490-Iloilo) to recover damages for the palay and mongo he lost during his dispossession [2]. Militar moved to dismiss, arguing that the CAR lacked jurisdiction over actions for damages and that Torcillero's claim was barred by the rule against splitting causes of action, as it should have been litigated in the first case [3]. The CAR denied the motion and ordered Militar to pay damages [4]. Militar filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations has jurisdiction over actions for recovery of damages arising from the unlawful dispossession of a tenant.
2. W/N the subsequent action for damages is barred by the rule against splitting causes of action given the reservation in the prior judgment.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court of Agrarian Relations is vested with exclusive and original jurisdiction to determine controversies arising from landlord-tenant relationships under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended. This jurisdiction includes the authority to hear and determine actions for recovery of damages arising from the unlawful dismissal or dispossession of a tenant. To hold otherwise would result in a multiplicity of suits and expensive litigations, which the law abhors [6].

2. **NO.** While the general rule laid down in *David vs. Cruz and Calma* is that a claim for reinstatement and a claim for damages should be litigated in one and the same case to avoid splitting a cause of action, Petitioner Militar waived this defense [6], [7]. The prior CAR judgment expressly reserved Torcillero's right to bring a separate action for damages. Although such reservation was erroneous, Militar's failure to appeal that judgment caused it to become final and executory. This failure to appeal constitutes a waiver, precluding him from filing a motion to dismiss the subsequent action on the ground of res judicata or splitting of causes of action [7].

The petition is denied [8].
