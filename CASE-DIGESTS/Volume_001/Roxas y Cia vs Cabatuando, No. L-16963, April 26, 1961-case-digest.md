I. CAPTION
ROXAS Y CIA v. HON. JOSE R. CABATUANDO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16963, April 26, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roxas y Cia, a partnership owning Hacienda Caylaway in Batangas, had a tenancy agreement with private respondents where the latter received no share of the coconut produce but gave Petitioner 1/6 of the auxiliary crops [1]. Believing this arrangement violated Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act), the tenants petitioned the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to declare the contract void [2]. Petitioner countered that the contract was valid and filed a counterclaim for ejectment, alleging the tenants failed to deliver the landlord's share of auxiliary crops for the years 1955-1957 [3]. The CAR ordered the tenants to account for and pay the arrears—which they did—but failed to order their ejectment [4]. Petitioner appealed the denial of the ejectment prayer [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenants should be ejected for their failure to deliver the landholder's share for three consecutive years.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that under Section 50(c) of Republic Act No. 1199 and the doctrine in *Paz v. Santos*, the mere failure of a tenant to pay the landholder's share does not justify ejectment when there is a lack of deliberate intent to pay [5]. The Court found the tenants acted in good faith; they withheld the shares not to defraud the Petitioner, but because they doubted the legality of the contract regarding the coconut produce and wished to force a judicial settlement of the controversy [6]. Furthermore, the harvests were meager, Petitioner had been indifferent to the non-payment for three years prior to the suit, and the tenants voluntarily accounted when ordered by the court [7]. The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is affirmed [8].
