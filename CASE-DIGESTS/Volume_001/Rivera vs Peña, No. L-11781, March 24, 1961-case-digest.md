I. CAPTION
TEOTIMO RIVERA v. TIMOTEO PEÑA, REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION and REGISTER OF DEEDS OF TARLAC, G.R. No. L-11781, March 24, 1961, 1 SCRA 1032, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Timoteo Peña was the registered owner of two parcels of land in Tarlac covered by TCT Nos. 23014 and 23015. On October 26, 1955, Peña mortgaged these lands to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) to guarantee a P25,000.00 loan. The mortgage deed, duly annotated on the titles, contained a prohibition against encumbering the mortgaged property in any manner without the written consent of the mortgagee.

Petitioner Teotimo Rivera held a contract of lease over the said parcels, executed by Peña on February 22, 1955, covering the period from September 14, 1956, to September 15, 1960 (a renewal of a previous contract). In September 1956, Rivera filed a petition to compel RFC to surrender the owner's duplicate titles to the Register of Deeds so he could register his leasehold rights.

RFC opposed the petition, citing the mortgage stipulation prohibiting encumbrances without its consent, which it had not granted. The lower court denied the petition. Rivera moved to have his rights registered as an adverse claim under Section 110 of Act No. 496, but this was also denied. Rivera appealed, arguing inter alia that the mortgage deed was not formally introduced in evidence.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's leasehold rights can be registered or annotated as an adverse claim on the titles despite the prohibition against encumbrance in the registered mortgage deed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the petitioner has no valid adverse claim to be registered.

The mortgage deed executed by Peña in favor of RFC expressly prohibited the mortgagor from creating any encumbrance on the property without the mortgagee's written consent. Since the petitioner's rights are derived from the mortgagor (Peña), he is bound by the mortgagor's commitments to the mortgagee. The Court held that where the mortgage deed containing such prohibition is registered, leasehold rights subsequently acquired or sought to be annotated cannot be registered as an adverse claim over the mortgagee's opposition.

Regarding the evidentiary procedure, the Court held that since the petition was filed in the very records for the registration of the land where the mortgage deed was already registered, the deed formed part of the records and did not need to be formally introduced in evidence.

**Orders affirmed.**
