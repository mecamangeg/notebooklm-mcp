I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENT CHURCH, represented by HILARION S. ZUMEL v. JUANA MATEO and ISIDRO G. OLAÑO, G.R. No. L-14793, April 28, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 11, 1952, petitioner Philippine Independent Church (PIC), represented by Hilarion S. Zumel, filed a petition for review of a decree of registration issued on December 14, 1951, in favor of respondents Juana Mateo and Isidro G. Olaño. PIC alleged that Olaño, a former parish priest and trustee, fraudulently adjudicated the church's property (Lot No. 748) to himself and his wife.

During the hearing, respondents questioned whether Zumel represented the "De los Reyes" or "Fonacier" faction of the church. Consequently, on January 26, 1953—after the one-year reglementary period for reviewing the decree had expired—PIC filed an amended petition stating Zumel belonged to the Fonacier faction. Later, Zumel clarified that the faction was immaterial as he was authorized by the lawful head, De los Reyes. The Court of First Instance of Isabela dismissed the petition, ruling that the amendment was filed outside the jurisdictional one-year period and suggested filing a separate action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the amendment of the petition relates back to the date of the original filing, thereby saving the action from prescription.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that amendments to pleadings relate back to the date of the original complaint when the claim asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence [1]. Since amendment presupposes the existence of something to be amended, the tolling of the period relates back to the filing of the pleading sought to be amended [1].

The Court emphasized that the true petitioner is the Philippine Independent Church, and the erroneous designation of a representative is not sufficient to set aside proceedings when the entity itself is named (*De Nilo v. Romero*) [2]. Furthermore, the trial court's suggestion to file a separate action is frowned upon under the policy against multiplicity of suits [1].

The order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [3].
