I. CAPTION
**IN RE: PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME. JUAN MANUEL, ET AL. v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-15811, March 27, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Manuel and his children filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to change their surname from "Manuel" to "Eaton." Juan alleged that he is the illegitimate child of John Eaton, an American, and Maria Arachea Manuel, a Filipina. He sought the change to avoid confusion with other persons named Juan Manuel in his municipality and to follow the surname of his putative father. The Republic opposed the petition. The trial court granted the petition, allowing the change of name. The Republic appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an illegitimate child can change his surname to that of his putative father absent any evidence of acknowledgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that under the Civil Code (specifically Articles 282 and 366), a natural child may use the father's surname only if he is acknowledged by both parents. If the child is recognized by only one parent, he shall employ the surname of the recognizing parent. In this case, there was no evidence presented that petitioner Juan Manuel was duly recognized by his alleged father, John Eaton.

The Court emphasized that while there may be a practical need to change a name to avoid confusion, a petitioner should not be allowed to use a surname which he is otherwise not permitted to employ under the law. Since Juan was not recognized by his father, allowing the name change would give judicial sanction to the use of a surname not allowed by the laws governing family relations.

Consequently, the decision appealed from was **REVERSED**.
