I. CAPTION
PASCUAL STA. ANA v. EULALIO MENLA, ARCADIO NARVADES and DOMINGA NARVADES, G.R. No. L-15564, April 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
A decision in a land registration case was rendered on November 28, 1931 [1]. However, the judicial records of the proceedings were lost during the liberation of the Philippines in 1945 [2]. On June 24, 1947, oppositors-appellees (Narvades) filed a petition for the reconstitution of the records [2]. Applicant-appellant Sta. Ana opposed, arguing that the 1931 decision had become unenforceable and barred by the Statute of Limitations because more than 15 years had elapsed since its rendition [2]. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur overruled the objection, ordered the reconstitution, and subsequently directed the issuance of the decree of registration in favor of the oppositors [3], [1]. Sta. Ana appealed, invoking Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which limits the enforcement of judgments to ten years [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for reconstitution was filed on time.
2. W/N the execution of a final judgment in a land registration case is barred by the Statute of Limitations or Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (five/ten-year period).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petition was not belated [2]. Under Act No. 3110, records lost due to public calamity may be reconstituted "as soon as practicable" [2]. Additionally, a Supreme Court resolution extended the period for reconstitution to June 30, 1947, and Republic Act No. 441 further extended it to June 7, 1951 [2]. Since the petition was filed on June 24, 1947, it was well within the authorized period [2].

2. **NO.** Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides that judgments may be enforced by motion within five years and by action within ten years, applies only to civil actions and not to special proceedings like land registration cases [5], [4]. In civil actions, a judgment must be enforced against an adverse party, whereas in land registration, the purpose is to establish a status or fact of ownership [5], [4]. Once ownership is confirmed by judicial declaration, the judgment becomes final and no further proceeding is necessary to enforce it, unless the adverse party is in possession and must be ousted [6], [4]. Furthermore, the Land Registration Act contains no provision limiting the period for the issuance of a decree of registration [7], [8]. The issuance of such a decree is a ministerial duty of the court and the Land Registration Commission, and the failure to issue it due to the absence of a motion cannot prejudice the declared owner [7], [8].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [9].
