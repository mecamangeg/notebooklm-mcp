I. CAPTION
JOVENAL R. FERNANDEZ v. TAN TIONG TICK, G.R. No. L-15877, April 28, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Fernandez filed an action for damages against defendant Tan Tiong Tick for the wrongful seizure of 30 tons of scrap iron [1, 2]. During the trial on February 3, 1959, after Fernandez rested his case, Tan Tiong Tick's counsel presented a Deputy Sheriff as a witness [3]. Counsel then moved for postponement to present the defendant, who was allegedly ill with the flu, but the trial court refused unless counsel paid the plaintiff's expenses for the delay [4, 5]. Consequently, counsel rested the case with the evidence already introduced [6]. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Fernandez [7]. Tan Tiong Tick appealed, arguing that his counsel's "abrupt" resting of the case amounted to an unauthorized confession of judgment and that the failure to inform him of this status constituted excusable negligence warranting a reopening of the case [8, 9].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the counsel's act of resting the case instead of pressing for postponement constitutes a confession of judgment.
2. W/N the negligence of counsel in not informing the client he rested the case constitutes excusable negligence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The counsel’s act was not a confession of judgment as he did not withdraw defenses or consent to an entry of judgment [10]. The record showed he extensively cross-examined the plaintiff and presented evidence [10]. At most, the move was a mistake or lack of foresight, but a client is bound by the action of his counsel in the conduct of a case and cannot be heard to complain that the result might have been different had he proceeded differently [10]. The Court cited *U.S. v. Umali* and *Montes v. Court* to emphasize that mistakes or lack of preparation by counsel are not valid grounds for reopening cases [10].

2. **NO.** Negligence is excusable only under specific circumstances such as failure to receive notice or genuine mistake [11]. Here, both the client and counsel were duly notified of the hearing [12]. A client is bound by his counsel's conduct and has a duty to inquire about the status of his case, exercising the "standard of care which an ordinarily prudent man bestows upon his important business" (*Gaylord v. Berry*) [12]. Additionally, the Court noted that the petition to set aside the judgment was fatally defective because it lacked the affidavits of merit required by Rule 38, Section 3 of the Rules of Court [13].

The order of the trial court is affirmed [14].
