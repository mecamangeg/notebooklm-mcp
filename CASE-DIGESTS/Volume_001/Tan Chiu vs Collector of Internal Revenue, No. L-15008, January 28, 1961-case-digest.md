I. CAPTION
TAN CHIU v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-15008, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Chiu purchased knitting materials amounting to P45,179.64 and P6,939.18 between 1956 and May 1957 to manufacture undershirts [1]. He was assessed and required to pay P3,648.32 as percentage tax on the sales of the manufactured undershirts [1]. Tan Chiu filed a claim for refund, arguing that the cost of the materials should be deducted from the gross selling price [1]. However, the knitting materials were purchased from a tax-exempt industry operating under Republic Act No. 901, meaning no sales tax had been previously paid on them [2], [3]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denied the refund, reasoning that the deduction allowed under Section 186 of the Internal Revenue Code is intended to prevent double taxation, which was not present in this case [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cost of raw materials purchased from a tax-exempt industry is deductible from the gross selling price for the purpose of computing sales tax.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals [5]. The Court held that the purpose of Section 186 of the Internal Revenue Code, which authorizes the deduction of the cost of materials from the gross selling price, is to avoid or prevent double taxation [6], [1]. Since the cotton knitting materials were manufactured by a tax-exempt industry under Republic Act No. 901, no sales tax was collected on them [2], [6]. Where materials have not been previously taxed, their cost is not deductible from the selling price of the manufactured article because there is no risk of double taxation [2]. The Court rejected the petitioner's argument distinguishing the tax-exempt "payor" from the "product," ruling that when a manufacturer in a new and necessary industry is exempt, the products they manufacture are effectively exempt from sales tax [3].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is affirmed [5].
