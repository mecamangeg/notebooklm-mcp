I. CAPTION
THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. DOUGLAS FISHER and BETTINA FISHER, and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-11622 and L-11668, January 28, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Walter Stevenson, a British subject born in the Philippines, married Beatrice Stevenson, another British subject, in Manila in 1909. They resided in the Philippines until 1945, when they moved to California, USA, where Walter died in 1951. His will instituted Beatrice as his sole heiress. Ancillary administration proceedings were filed in Manila for his Philippine assets, which included 210,000 shares of stock in Mindanao Mother Lode Mines, Inc. and real property in Baguio City. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed estate and inheritance taxes. The estate paid but subsequently filed amended returns claiming refunds. The estate argued that: (1) the one-half share of the surviving spouse should be deducted based on the conjugal partnership system; and (2) the intangible personal property (shares) was exempt from inheritance tax under the reciprocity clause of Section 122 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled in favor of the estate on these issues. The CIR appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the property relations of British spouses married in Manila in 1909 are governed by the conjugal partnership of gains.
2. W/N the estate is exempt from Philippine inheritance tax on intangible personal property based on reciprocity with California law.
3. W/N the indebtedness incurred in California is deductible from the Philippine estate.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Although Article 1325 of the Old Civil Code (the law in force in 1909) provides that the property relations of foreigners married in the Philippines shall be governed by the husband's national law (English law), the petitioner failed to prove what the English law was. Under the doctrine of **processual presumption**, in the absence of proof of foreign law, it is presumed to be the same as the law of the forum. Therefore, the Philippine law on conjugal partnership applies, and the one-half share of the surviving spouse is correctly deducted from the hereditary estate [1-3].

2. **NO.** Section 122 of the NIRC grants an exemption for intangibles only if the foreign country of the decedent grants a *similar exemption* from transfer or death taxes of *every character*. The Court held that reciprocity must be **total**. While California law exempts non-residents from inheritance tax, it does not provide exemption from the Federal Estate Tax, which is also applicable in California. Since the Philippines imposes both estate and inheritance taxes, and the foreign law does not grant exemption from *all* types of death taxes (specifically the estate tax), partial reciprocity is insufficient. The shares are subject to Philippine inheritance tax [4-6].

3. **NO.** The Court disallowed the deduction for indebtedness for two reasons: (1) The claim was not presented to and approved by the Philippine probate court in the ancillary proceedings as required by the Rules of Court [7]; and (2) Under Section 89(d)(1) of the NIRC, no deduction is allowed for a non-resident alien unless the return includes the value of that part of the gross estate *not situated in the Philippines* to calculate the proportionate deduction. The estate failed to declare the value of the properties situated outside the Philippines [8, 9].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.
