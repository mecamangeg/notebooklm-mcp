I. CAPTION
JUAN SANCHEZ v. OSCAR DEL ROSARIO, G.R. No. L-16878, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Sanchez, a defeated candidate for councilor in Bocaue, Bulacan, filed a petition for *quo warranto* against respondent Oscar Del Rosario, the winning candidate. It was undisputed that Del Rosario was born on August 3, 1938, making him only 21 years, 3 months, and 7 days old at the time of the election [1], [2]. This violated Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code, which requires an elective municipal officer to be at least 23 years of age [2]. The Court of First Instance of Bulacan declared Del Rosario ineligible and unseated him [1]. Del Rosario appealed, arguing that Sanchez was estopped for not questioning his candidacy earlier, that Sanchez lacked legal personality as he was not entitled to the office, and that a previous COMELEC petition regarding Nacionalista Party candidates constituted *res judicata* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is estopped from filing *quo warranto* for failing to question the respondent's candidacy before the election.
2. W/N the petitioner has legal personality to file the suit even if he is not entitled to assume the office.
3. W/N the age requirement is merely directory after the election.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The right to an elective municipal office can be contested only after proclamation [4]. Since there are no authorized proceedings to bar an eligible candidate from running for office prior to the election, the mere failure to question the respondent's candidacy earlier does not place the petitioner in estoppel [5].

2. **YES.** Section 173 of the Revised Election Code allows any registered candidate to contest the right of an ineligible person elected to office [6]. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the fact that the petitioner is not entitled to the office does not bar the filing of a *quo warranto* petition, otherwise, the provision would be rendered nugatory [7], [8].

3. **NO.** The age qualification prescribed in Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code is mandatory [2]. Citing *Feliciano v. Aquino*, the Court held that the age requirement must be satisfied. In this case, the appellant failed to meet the age requirement both at the time of the election and at the time of assumption of office [9].

The judgment appealed from is affirmed [10].
