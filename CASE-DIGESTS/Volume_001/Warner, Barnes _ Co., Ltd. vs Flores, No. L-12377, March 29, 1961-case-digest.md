I. CAPTION
WARNER, BARNES & CO., LTD. v. RAMON FLORES, G.R. No. L-12377, March 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
In November 1940, Ramon Flores purchased fertilizer worth P3,127.90 from Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd., payable on or before December 31, 1941. To secure the obligation, Flores executed a chattel mortgage on his 1941-42 sugar crop. Warner, Barnes & Co. received warehouse receipts ("quedans") for 278 piculs of Flores' share, issued in Flores' name but noted as mortgaged to the company. Due to the outbreak of World War II and lack of shipping, neither party could sell the sugar. Subsequently, all the sugar stored in the mill was lost, burned, or looted during the Japanese occupation. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental ruled in favor of Warner, Barnes & Co., ordering Flores to pay the outstanding balance. Flores appealed, arguing that the company’s possession of the quedans and failure to sell the sugar extinguished his debt.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the loss of the mortgaged sugar extinguishes the mortgagor's financial obligation to the mortgagee.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the loss of the collateral does not extinguish the principal obligation. Under the maxim *res periit domino suo*, the owner bears the loss of the property. A chattel mortgage is merely a security; the mortgagee does not automatically become the owner of the mortgaged goods but only retains the right to sell them to satisfy the debt. The Court cited *Martinez v. Philippine National Bank*, reiterating that ownership remains with the mortgagor (Flores) and does not pass to the mortgagee/pledgee (Warner, Barnes & Co.) by mere delivery of the quedans or authorization to sell. Since Flores remained the owner of the sugar at the time of its destruction, he bears the loss, and his liability to pay for the fertilizer subsists.

The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
