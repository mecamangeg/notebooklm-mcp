**I. CAPTION**
THE GUAGUA ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT COMPANY, INC. v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. 14421, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Guagua Electric Light Plant Co., Inc. obtained a municipal franchise in 1927 which prescribed a franchise tax of 1% of gross earnings for the first 20 years and 2% for the next 15 years [1]. Petitioner's records were destroyed during the war, leading it to pay the higher 5% franchise tax rate under Section 259 of the Tax Code based on the belief and alleged demands of the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue [1-3]. In December 1956, petitioner discovered a copy of its original franchise [1]. On March 27, 1957, it filed a claim for refund for overpayments made, which the Collector denied [1, 4].

On February 28, 1958, petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [5]. The Collector moved to dismiss the petition on the ground of prescription, citing Section 306 of the Internal Revenue Code [4]. The CTA dismissed the petition because the action was filed beyond the two-year period from the date of payment [6]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the two-year period should not apply because the payments were induced by the Collector's misrepresentation discovered only in 1956 [6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the petitioner's suit for tax refund is barred by the two-year prescriptive period under Section 306 of the Tax Code.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's dismissal, ruling that the suit was barred by prescription [7].

The Court held that Section 306 of the Tax Code is mandatory [8, 9]. It explicitly provides that "no such suit or proceeding shall be begun after the expiration of two years from the date of payment of the tax or penalty" [10]. This provision is not subject to any qualification and applies regardless of the conditions under which the payment was made, including alleged misrepresentation [8, 9].

The Court also rejected the petitioner's reliance on *Panay Electric Co. v. Collector*, noting that the circumstances there—specifically a pending litigation that suspended the period and an agreement by the Collector to abide by the decision—were absent in this case [11, 12]. Consequently, the right to claim a refund was barred by the lapse of the statutory two-year period [12].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Bengzon, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Paredes, and Dizon, JJ., concurred [7].
