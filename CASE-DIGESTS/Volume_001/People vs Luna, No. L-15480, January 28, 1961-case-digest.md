I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LT. JG BERGUNIO LUNA**, G.R. No. L-15480, January 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
In February 1954, Lt. Bergunio Luna, a Philippine Navy officer commanding a marine detachment on a landing mechanized craft (LCM), was conducting operations in Sulu [1]. On board were his men and Moro civilian guides, including Datu Jainal, as well as three young captives: Mustapha, Suyoc, and Abdulmunap Ilahan [1, 2]. While transporting the captives, Luna ordered the craft to stop at Bato-Bato Island, where guides disembarked to collect heavy stones [1]. Later, upon Luna's orders, the craft slowed down in the open sea [3]. The guides tied the three boys, weighted them with the stones, and pushed them overboard into the water, while Luna and Datu Jainal—who held a grudge against the victims' family—conversed nearby [3-5]. Luna later warned his men that "Dead men tell no tales" [3].

Luna was charged with triple murder. The Court of First Instance of Sulu convicted him, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [6]. Luna appealed, claiming he was asleep during the incident and that the *corpus delicti* was not proven as the bodies were never recovered [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N there was conspiracy in the commission of the crime.
2. W/N the *corpus delicti* was established despite the failure to recover the bodies.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Conspiracy exists where the evidence shows the accused acted in concert. The Supreme Court found that the sequence of events—Luna ordering the stop at an island to retrieve heavy stones, ordering the stop in the middle of the sea, and conversing with Datu Jainal while the victims were being bound and weighted—pointed to no other conclusion than that they acted in unison to accomplish the killing [9, 10].

2. **YES.** The *corpus delicti* was sufficiently proven by the undeniable fact that the three victims were tied, weighted, dumped into the sea, and never seen again [8]. In murder, *corpus delicti* requires the fact of death, which was established by the circumstances of their disappearance [11].

The conviction is **AFFIRMED**. Although the crime constitutes triple murder aggravated by evident premeditation, warranting the death penalty, the penalty imposed was *reclusion perpetua* due to a lack of sufficient votes [12].
