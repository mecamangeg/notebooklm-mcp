I. CAPTION
DOLORES EVANGELISTA, et al. v. PERPETUO MENDOZA, et al., G.R. No. L-15522, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
On February 7, 1955, Dolores Evangelista and others (plaintiffs) filed a complaint against the Director of Lands and Perpetuo Mendoza to annul the latter's homestead application [1]. Plaintiffs alleged that the application covered a portion of Lot No. 2443, Naujan Cadastre, which had been adjudicated to their predecessors-in-interest in 1930 [1]. The complaint was later amended to include Mateo Macaraeg, the purchaser of the land [2]. After the plaintiffs presented their evidence during the trial, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, attaching the homestead patent to their motion [3]. On September 27, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro dismissed the complaint solely on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to introduce the homestead patent in evidence [4]. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court validly dismissed the complaint due to the plaintiffs' failure to offer the homestead patent in evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was erroneous. Although the plaintiffs-appellants did not present a copy of the homestead patent at trial, the defendants (Director of Lands and Macaraeg) attached said patent to their joint motion to dismiss, thereby making it part of the pleading [4]. This act rendered the presentation of the document by the plaintiffs unnecessary, as the lower court was already afforded the chance to examine the patent submitted as an annex [4], [5].

The order of dismissal was set aside and the case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [5].
