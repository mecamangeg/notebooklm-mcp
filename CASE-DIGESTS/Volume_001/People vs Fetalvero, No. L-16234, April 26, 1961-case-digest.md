I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARIANITO FETALVERO and FILADELFO CACHOLA, G.R. No. L-16234, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 1, 1955, in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, Ernesto Alquetra and his 10-year-old nephew Enrique went to a vacant lot [1]. Marianito Fetalvero suddenly appeared, drew a gun, and shot Ernesto [2]. As Ernesto tried to flee, he was met by Filadelfo Cachola, Fetalvero’s brother-in-law, who also fired at him, resulting in Ernesto's death [2]. Fetalvero claimed self-defense, alleging the victim drew a gun first, while Cachola interposed an alibi that he was home cooking [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur convicted both accused of murder, sentencing Fetalvero to an indeterminate penalty of *reclusion temporal* and Cachola to *reclusion perpetua* [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused’s defenses of self-defense and alibi are meritorious.
2. W/N the killing constitutes murder qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Fetalvero’s plea of self-defense is uncorroborated and contradicted by the physical evidence, as no gun was found on the victim [6]. Regarding Cachola, his alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by witnesses, particularly the 10-year-old nephew who identified him immediately after the incident [4, 7]. Furthermore, the accused's house was only 100 meters from the crime scene, making it physically possible for him to be present [8]. The factual findings of the trial court regarding witness credibility are entitled to great weight [9].

2. **YES.** The suddenness of the attack qualifies the crime as murder through treachery [10]. The Supreme Court held that treachery absorbs the circumstances of abuse of superior strength and nocturnity [10].

The appealed decision is **AFFIRMED** *in toto* [11].
