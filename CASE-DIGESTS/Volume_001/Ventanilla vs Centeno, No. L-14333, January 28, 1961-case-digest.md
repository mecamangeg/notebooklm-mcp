I. CAPTION
OSCAR VENTANILLA v. GREGORIO CENTENO, G.R. No. L-14333, January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 215, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Oscar Ventanilla retained the services of Respondent Atty. Gregorio Centeno to prosecute Civil Case No. 18833 for the recovery of P4,000.00 and damages. After receiving an unfavorable decision on July 21, 1955, Centeno filed a notice of appeal. Ventanilla subsequently issued a check for P60.00 as an appeal bond and left it with Centeno's clerk on August 18, 1955, as Centeno was in the province campaigning for office. Centeno returned on August 22, cashed the check, and attempted to file the appeal bond, but the Clerk of Court refused it because the reglementary period for appeal had already expired. Consequently, the record on appeal was disapproved.

Ventanilla filed an action for damages against Centeno, alleging that the lawyer’s negligence caused him to lose the opportunity to recover the P4,000.00 and other damages from the original defendants. The trial court declared Centeno negligent but awarded Ventanilla only P200.00 in nominal damages. Ventanilla appealed, arguing he was entitled to actual, moral, temperate, and exemplary damages, and that the nominal damages were insufficient.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is entitled to actual or compensatory damages for the loss of the original case due to his lawyer's negligence.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to moral damages.
3. W/N the award of P200.00 as nominal damages is sufficient.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that Ventanilla is not entitled to actual damages. Under Article 2199 of the Civil Code, actual damages must be supported by competent evidence of actual pecuniary loss. Ventanilla's claim—that he lost the chance to recover P4,000.00 and damages because the appeal was not perfected—was deemed "highly speculative" because there was no assurance he would have won the appeal even if it had been perfected [1].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that moral damages are not recoverable in this case. Under Articles 2217 and 2219 of the Civil Code, moral damages for quasi-delicts are generally limited to those causing physical injuries, or specific cases involving malicious acts, defamation, etc. A lawyer's mere negligence in failing to perfect an appeal does not fall under the enumerated cases where moral damages are allowed [2, 3]. Additionally, since nominal damages were awarded, temperate damages (which are more than nominal but less than compensatory) could not be recovered [4], and exemplary damages were denied because the defendant did not act in a wanton, fraudulent, or oppressive manner (Arts. 2232, 2233) [5].

3. **YES.** The Court affirmed the award of P200.00 as nominal damages. Under Article 2221 of the Civil Code, nominal damages are adjudicated to vindicate a right violated, not to indemnify a loss. The assessment is left to the discretion of the court (Art. 2216). Considering the speculative nature of the original case's outcome, the Court found P200.00 sufficient to vindicate Ventanilla's rights and rejected his demand for P2,000.00 as excessive [6].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.
