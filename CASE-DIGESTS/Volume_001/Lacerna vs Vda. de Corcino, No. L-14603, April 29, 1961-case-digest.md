I. CAPTION
RICARDO LACERNA, ET AL. v. AGATONA PAURILLO VDA. DE CORCINO, G.R. No. L-14603, April 29, 1961, 1 SCRA 1226, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants (Ricardo Lacerna, et al.) are the maternal first cousins of the deceased Juan Marbebe. They filed an action in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to recover three parcels of unregistered land in Maasin, Iloilo, claiming to be Juan's sole heirs [1]. Jacoba Marbebe intervened, claiming to be Juan's paternal half-sister and sole heir [2].

It was established that Juan Marbebe inherited the subject lands from his mother, Bonifacia Lacerna [3]. The plaintiffs argued that under Article 891 of the Civil Code (*reserva troncal*), the property should pass to the heirs within the third degree belonging to the line from which the property came (the maternal line), thereby excluding Jacoba who belongs to the paternal line [4]. The CFI ruled in favor of Jacoba Marbebe [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the property inherited by a descendant from an ascendant is subject to *reserva troncal*, thereby preferring relatives of the line of origin over a half-sister.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the property is not subject to *reserva troncal*.

Article 891 of the Civil Code provides that the "ascendant who inherits from his descendant any property which the latter may have acquired by gratuitous title from another ascendant, or a brother or sister, is obliged to reserve such property... for the benefit of relatives who are within the third degree and who belong to the line from which said property came" [3, 5]. The Court explained that this article applies only to properties inherited by an *ascendant* from a *descendant*. In this case, the property was inherited by a *descendant* (Juan Marbebe) from an *ascendant* (his mother). Therefore, the provision is not applicable [3].

Consequently, the transmission of the estate is governed by the ordinary rules of intestate succession (Articles 1003 to 1009, Civil Code). Under these rules, a sister, even if only a half-sister, excludes all other collateral relatives (such as cousins), regardless of the line from which the property came [3].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].
