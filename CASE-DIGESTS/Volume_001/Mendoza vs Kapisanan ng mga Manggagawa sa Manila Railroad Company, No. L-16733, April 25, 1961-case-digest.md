I. CAPTION
MANUELA MENDOZA, ET AL. v. KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, G.R. No. L-16733, April 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Manuela Mendoza and Maria Enriquez are the widows of Emilio Magnayon and Benigno Santos, respectively, who were employees of the Manila Railroad Company and members of the defendant Union. Both husbands were declared unfit for work due to physical disabilities and applied for retirement. The GSIS approved Magnayon's retirement effective June 1, 1956, and Santos' effective September 16, 1956 [1-3]. Both men applied for and received retirement gratuities from the Union under Article VI, Section 1(f) of the Union Constitution [2, 4].

Magnayon died on September 26, 1956, and Santos died on October 10, 1956 [4, 5]. Following their deaths, their widows demanded death benefits under Article VI, Section 1(a) of the Union Constitution, which provides benefits upon the death of a member [4, 5]. The Union refused to pay, arguing the deceased were already retired. The widows filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila, which dismissed the complaint [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the widows are entitled to death benefits under the Union Constitution even though their husbands had retired prior to their deaths.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal. The Court held that under Article VI, Section 1(a) of the Union Constitution and By-Laws, death benefits are intended to be paid only when a member in good standing dies "while still a member of the union" [7].

The Court found that at the time of their deaths, the husbands were already deemed retired because their retirements had become effective on June 1, 1956, and September 16, 1956, respectively [7]. The fact that the widows received official notice of the retirement approval from GSIS after the deaths is immaterial; the effective date of approval controls [7, 8]. Furthermore, the deceased had already applied for and collected retirement gratuity from the Union based on their separation from service [8]. It would be contrary to logic to allow the collection of retirement pay (effective upon leaving the service) and death benefits (dependent on being a member at the time of death) for the same period [9].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [10].
