I. CAPTION
MARIA GERVACIO BLAS, MANUEL GERVACIO BLAS, LEONCIO GERVACIO BLAS and LOIDA GERVACIO BLAS v. ROSALINA SANTOS, in her capacity as Special Administratrix of the Estate of the deceased MAXIMA SANTOS VDA. DE BLAS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14070, March 29, 1961, 1 SCRA 899, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Simeon Blas contracted a first marriage with Marta Cruz, with whom he had three children. After Marta's death, he married Maxima Santos. No liquidation of the properties acquired during the first marriage was made [1]. On December 26, 1936, a week before his death, Simeon executed a will declaring all his properties as conjugal assets of his second marriage [2], [3]. To prevent his children from the first marriage from contesting the will and demanding liquidation of the first marriage's assets, Simeon asked Maxima to execute a document (Exhibit "A") [4]. In Exhibit "A", Maxima promised that she would respect Simeon's will and that she would give one-half of the portion corresponding to her share of the conjugal assets to the heirs and legatees of Simeon in her own will [5], [6]. Simeon died in 1937. Maxima died in 1956, but she failed to comply with her promise in Exhibit "A" [7]. The heirs of Simeon filed an action to enforce the promise [8]. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Exhibit "A" was a void contract on future inheritance and lacked consideration [9].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Exhibit "A" is void for being a contract on future inheritance prohibited under Article 1271 of the Old Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Exhibit "A" is valid and enforceable. The Court held that the document is a compromise to avoid litigation and a contract with sufficient consideration [10], [11]. It does not fall under the prohibition of Article 1271 regarding contracts on future inheritance [11]. The Court defined future inheritance as "any property or right not in existence or capable of determination at the time of the contract, that a person may in the future acquire by succession" [12]. In this case, the subject matter of Exhibit "A" was Maxima's share in the conjugal properties, which were already well-defined and existing at the time of the agreement in 1936 [13], [12]. Since the properties were actually in existence, they cannot be considered future inheritance [12]. The right of action arose only upon Maxima's death when she failed to comply with the promise [14].

The petition was **GRANTED**. The judgment was reversed, and the administratrix of Maxima Santos was ordered to convey one-half of Maxima's share in the conjugal properties to the heirs and legatees of Simeon Blas [15].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
*   **Reyes, J.B.L., J. (Concurring):** Emphasized that the prohibition on "future inheritance" refers to the universality of the estate (assets and liabilities) held at the time of death, not to specific, existing properties owned by the grantor at the time of the contract [16].
*   **Barrera, J. (Concurring):** Agreed that the obligation referred to specific conjugal share and not Maxima's future hereditary estate [17].
*   **Bautista Angelo, J. (Dissenting):** Argued that Maxima substantially complied with the promise because Exhibit "A" allowed her to "select or choose" the beneficiaries, and she did provide legacies to some of Simeon's heirs in her will [18], [19].
