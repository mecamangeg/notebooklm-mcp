I. CAPTION
LEONARDO C. PADILLA v. RIZAL SURETY & INSURANCE CO., G.R. No. L-14747, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. filed a replevin suit against Evaristo Zulueta to foreclose a chattel mortgage on a car. Petitioner Leonardo C. Padilla, a subsequent buyer of the car, filed a third-party claim. To retain possession of the vehicle, Padilla and Manila Surety & Insurance Co. filed a redelivery bond (counterbond).

On September 13, 1956, the Court of First Instance (CFI) rendered a decision ordering Padilla to deliver the car to Respondent or pay its value of P1,500. The decision expressly reserved Respondent's right to proceed against Padilla and his surety on the counterbond. Padilla received a copy of this decision on September 14, 1956, but did not appeal.

On November 24, 1956, acting on a motion by Respondent, the CFI issued an order sentencing Padilla and his surety to pay P1,500 (value of the car) and P3,000 in actual damages. On January 25, 1957, Padilla filed a notice of appeal, arguing that the November 24 order amended the September 13 decision, implying his appeal period should count from the later order. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal regarding the car's delivery as late, ruling the original decision had already become final.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the subsequent order fixing damages on the redelivery bond constituted an amendment of the original decision, thereby extending the period to appeal the main judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the September 13, 1956 decision consisted of two distinct parts: (1) the order for Padilla to return the car or pay its value, and (2) the reservation of the right to proceed against the counterbond under Section 10, Rule 62 of the Rules of Court. The subsequent order of November 24, 1956, which fixed damages on the bond, was issued in pursuance of the reservation and did not modify or change the primary directive to return the automobile.

Therefore, the original decision regarding the return of the car became final and executory 30 days after Padilla received it on September 14, 1956. Since Padilla failed to appeal within that period, the judgment became final against him on October 14, 1956. His notice of appeal filed in January 1957 was too late to question the principal obligation. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, although it sustained the remand of the case to the lower court solely to receive evidence regarding the P3,000 damages, which had been awarded without proof.

Petition denied.
