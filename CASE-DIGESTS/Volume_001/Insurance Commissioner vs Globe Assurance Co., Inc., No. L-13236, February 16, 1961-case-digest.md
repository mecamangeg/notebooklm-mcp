I. CAPTION
THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER v. GLOBE ASSURANCE CO., INC., G.R. No. L-13236, February 16, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
In January and February 1956, the Insurance Commissioner examined the records of Globe Assurance Co., Inc. and discovered irregularities indicating the company's precarious financial condition [1]. Specifically, the company had no cash deposited in banks and kept daily collections in its safe, a practice deemed unsound [2]. Based on these findings, the Court of First Instance of Manila ordered the liquidation of the company [1]. Globe Assurance appealed, admitting the findings but arguing that liquidation was not mandatory and requesting a 180-day period to rehabilitate itself based on a plan submitted on October 22, 1956 [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the liquidation of the insurance company is proper despite its proposal for rehabilitation.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the liquidation was proper. The Insurance Commissioner's disapproval of the rehabilitation plan carries great weight because, by reason of his position and experience, he is best qualified to pass upon its soundness [5, 6]. The Court found that the rehabilitation plan offered no reasonable assurance of success [4]. Distinguishing this case from *Government v. El Hogar Filipino* and *Government v. Philippine Sugar Estates*, the Court noted that the irregularities here were not merely technical but affected the financial stability of the firm and the faith and trust the public must have in insurance companies [2]. Consequently, public interest demanded its liquidation and dissolution [6].

Decision affirmed [7].
