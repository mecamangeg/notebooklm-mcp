I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PAMPILO DE TORRES, G.R. No. L-11815, January 31, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On May 15, 1954, Simplicio Alcantara was walking home with two companions in Calauan, Laguna when he was shot and killed by an unseen assailant [1]. Two months later, accused Pampilo de Torres was wounded and captured during an encounter between the Army and the Huks [2]. While in custody, De Torres executed a sworn statement (Exhibit C) confessing that he ambushed the victim due to jealousy over a woman, confirming a previous letter (Exhibit D) he wrote admitting the crime before joining the Huks [3, 4]. The defense argued that the confession was inadmissible because it was secured through a promise of leniency by a PC investigator, who allegedly assured De Torres he would only be charged with rebellion [4]. The Court of First Instance of Laguna convicted him of murder [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the extrajudicial confession is admissible despite an alleged promise of immunity by a constabulary investigator.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that a promise of immunity by one who is not a prosecuting officer and who could not honor or comply with such promise is no ground for objecting to the admissibility of a confession [6, 7]. The Court found the confession was voluntarily signed and sworn to before the Justice of the Peace, who had read and explained the contents to the accused [8]. Furthermore, the confession was substantially corroborated by evidence of the *corpus delicti*, the accused's motive, and his flight to join the Huks [9].

Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court sentencing the accused to *reclusion perpetua* for murder qualified by treachery is **AFFIRMED** [10, 11].
