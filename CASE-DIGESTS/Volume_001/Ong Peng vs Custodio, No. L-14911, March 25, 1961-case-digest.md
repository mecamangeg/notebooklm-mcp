I. CAPTION
ONG PENG v. JOSE CUSTODIO, G.R. No. L-14911, March 25, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On April 15, 1958, Ong Peng filed a suit against Jose Custodio to recover P2,527.30 for goods obtained. Custodio filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of prescription [1]. Ong Peng opposed the motion and attached an amended complaint which set forth the promissory note supporting the claim [1]. The trial court admitted the amended complaint on May 21, 1958, and denied the motion to dismiss [1]. Copies of the amended complaint and the court orders were served on Custodio's counsel by mail [1, 2].

Custodio failed to answer the amended complaint. On June 28, 1958, the trial court declared him in default and subsequently rendered judgment ordering him to pay the amount due [3, 4]. Custodio filed a motion to set aside the order of default, which was denied for lacking an affidavit of merits [3, 5]. He then filed a motion for reconsideration/relief claiming the note was forged, which was also denied [4, 6]. Custodio appealed, arguing that he never came under the court's jurisdiction regarding the amended complaint because no new summons was served upon him [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a new summons is necessary to acquire jurisdiction over a defendant regarding an amended complaint when said defendant has already appeared and filed a motion to dismiss.
2. W/N the order of default was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that after a defendant has appeared by virtue of a summons and presented a motion to dismiss, he may be served with the amended complaint without the need of another summons [7]. Service may be effected in the same form and manner as ordinary motions or papers [7]. The Court distinguished this from *Atkins, Kroll and Co. v. Domingo*, noting that in the present case, the defendant was already in court when the amended complaint was filed, and the amendment added no new matter but merely set forth the promissory note [7]. Therefore, ordinary service by mail was sufficient [8].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the amended complaint was served on the defendant's counsel by registered mail on May 12, 1958 [2]. The time for filing an answer commenced from the date of service [2]. Since Custodio failed to answer within the reglementary period, the order declaring him in default was justified [2]. Furthermore, the subsequent motion to set aside the default was properly denied because it was not accompanied by an affidavit of merits showing that the defendant had a good defense [5].

Appeal dismissed [9].
