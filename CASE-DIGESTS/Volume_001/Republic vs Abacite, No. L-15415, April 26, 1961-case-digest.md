I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, applicant, vs. PEDRO ABACITE, ET AL., claimants. DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, petitioner-appellant., G.R. No. L-15415, April 26, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner-appellant Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) was the registered owner of a parcel of land in Davao City with an area of 15.6882 hectares, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-4629. When the State instituted cadastral proceedings, DBP filed an answer claiming ownership of "Lot No. 1676," believing it corresponded to its entire property, and submitted TCT No. T-4629 as evidence. Based on this, the cadastral court issued a decree, and the Register of Deeds issued Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. O-117 to DBP.

DBP later discovered that "Lot No. 1676" contained only 92,052 square meters, while the remaining 63,830 square meters of its property had been designated as part of "Lot No. 1674," which the court had decreed as public land. DBP filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Davao (as cadastral court) to amend OCT No. O-117 to include the missing portion. The lower court denied the petition, reasoning that since DBP's answer only claimed Lot No. 1676, the court could not now amend the decree to include part of Lot No. 1674. DBP appealed. The Solicitor General, representing the Republic, acknowledged DBP's ownership of the disputed portion and consented to the amendment.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cadastral court may amend a certificate of title to include a portion of land covered by a prior registered title but erroneously excluded from the new cadastral title.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the amendment is proper. Under Section 112 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act), an alteration or amendment of a certificate of title is allowed when there is an error, omission, or mistake in its issuance, provided it does not reopen the original decree of registration and does not impair the rights of a purchaser in good faith.

The Court held that correcting the area and description in the new certificate to conform to the land lawfully belonging to the petitioner under a previous registration does not constitute a reopening of the original decree. On the contrary, it enforces the original adjudication. A cadastral court lacks jurisdiction to diminish or enlarge the area of land already covered by a duly registered title (in this case, derived from a homestead patent); its function regarding such land is limited to substituting the old certificate with a new one.

Since the Government, the decreed owner of Lot No. 1674, expressly recognized DBP's right and consented to the amendment, no third party would be prejudiced. The Order appealed from was set aside, and the Register of Deeds was directed to amend OCT No. O-117 to include all land embraced in TCT No. T-4629.
