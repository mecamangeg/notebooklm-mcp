I. CAPTION
FRANCISCO SANCHEZ, ET AL. v. MARTIN N. FRANCISCO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12539, March 16, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Sanchez et al., civil service eligibles and members of the police force of Cordova, Cebu, were dismissed from service on February 22, 1952, following an investigation by the municipal council on charges of electioneering. Petitioners immediately filed an appeal addressed to the Commissioner of Civil Service by delivering it to the Chief of Police. However, respondent Mayor Francisco failed to transmit the records to the Commissioner, effectively "pigeonholing" the appeal. Petitioners subsequently filed a petition for Mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to compel their reinstatement and payment of back salaries. The CFI ruled in favor of petitioners, ordering their reinstatement. Respondent Francisco appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a petition for Mandamus to compel reinstatement is the proper remedy when an administrative appeal has been filed but not transmitted to the appellate authority.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that since the petitioners had appealed the decision of the investigating committee in due time, the administrative case against them had not yet been finally disposed of. The fact that the records were not elevated to the Commissioner of Civil Service was due to the fault of the respondent Mayor. Consequently, the proper remedy is not Mandamus for immediate reinstatement, but the prosecution of their appeal which is considered pending. The Court modified the decision of the lower court, ordering the respondents to transmit the records of the administrative investigation to the Commissioner of Civil Service within ten days for the proper disposition of the appeal.

Decision modified.
