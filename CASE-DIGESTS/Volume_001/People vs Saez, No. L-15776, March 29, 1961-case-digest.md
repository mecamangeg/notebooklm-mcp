**I. CAPTION**
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ADOLFO SAEZ**, G.R. No. L-15776, March 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
On the night of March 9, 1955, appellant Adolfo Saez, armed with a rifle, patrolled his family's coconut plantation in Davao with several companions. Upon seeing two men, Agripino Patrimonio and Benito Guisansana, inside the plantation, Saez asked them to identify themselves. Receiving no answer, Saez fired several shots, killing Patrimonio. Saez then instructed his companions, Prudencio Esmalia and Roman Catian, to dispose of the body in a dry well at a different location [1]. The Court of First Instance convicted Saez of murder. He appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the findings of fact but certified the case to the Supreme Court because the penalty for murder should be *reclusion perpetua* [1]. Saez claimed alibi and attempted to shift the blame to his co-accused, but the Court found the positive identification by eyewitnesses and corroborating extrajudicial confessions sufficient to establish his authorship of the crime [2-4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the killing was attended by treachery (*alevosia*), qualifying the crime to murder.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the crime committed was only Homicide, not Murder. The fact that Saez asked the deceased and his companion to identify themselves before firing shows that there was no treachery. Citing *People v. Tumab*, the Court held that treachery cannot be appreciated where the accused made no preparation to kill the victim in a manner that insured the commission of the crime without risk to himself [5]. Even if an attack is sudden, it does not constitute *alevosia* unless the aggressor consciously adopted a mode of attack intended to facilitate the crime without risk. Giving the victims the opportunity to identify themselves negated this requirement, as it effectively gave them a chance to defend themselves or return the attack [5].

The crime was committed with the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, which was compensated by the mitigating circumstance of obfuscation. Consequently, the judgment was modified, and Saez was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prisión correccional* to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* [6, 7].
