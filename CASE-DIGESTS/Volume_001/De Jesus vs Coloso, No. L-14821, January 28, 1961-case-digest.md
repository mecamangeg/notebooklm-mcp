I. CAPTION
DOMINGO DE JESUS, in his capacity as Administrator of the Intestate Estate of Florentina N. Vda. de Jesus v. RODRIGO COLOSO, G.R. No. L-14821, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On February 12, 1955, defendant Rodrigo Coloso and the deceased Florentina N. Vda. de Jesus entered into a contract granting Coloso the exclusive right to manage "Hacienda Nolasco," a 315-hectare land in Samal, Bataan [1]. The agreement included duties for Coloso to pay taxes and introduce improvements, and an option to purchase the property for P60,000 within 10 years [1, 2].

Plaintiff Domingo de Jesus, as administrator, filed Civil Case No. 2511 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bataan, alleging Coloso breached the contract by failing to pay taxes and improve the land. He prayed for the rescission of the contract and the recovery of possession of the hacienda [2]. Coloso moved to dismiss on two grounds: (1) improper venue, arguing the action for rescission is personal, not real; and (2) pendency of another action, citing Civil Case No. 34243 in the CFI of Manila which he filed against De Jesus for damages regarding the option to buy [2]. The CFI of Bataan dismissed the complaint on both grounds [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the venue was properly laid in the CFI of Bataan.
2. W/N the action is barred by the pendency of the case in the CFI of Manila.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action is a real action properly filed where the land is situated. Although the complaint asks for the rescission of the contract, its ultimate purpose is to recover possession of real property (Hacienda Nolasco) due to the alleged breach [4]. Under Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, actions for the recovery of possession of land must be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province where the property is situated [5].

2. **NO.** The action is not barred by the pending Manila case. The present action in Bataan seeks recovery of possession based on a breach of contract terms (taxes, improvements), while the Manila action seeks damages for the administrator's alleged failure to execute a deed of sale and interference with negotiations [5]. Citing *Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation v. Aldecoa*, the Court held that an action to annul a contract is not a bar to a separate action to enforce rights arising from the same relation if the issues differ [6].

The order of the Court of First Instance of Bataan is **REVERSED** and the case is remanded for further proceedings [6].
