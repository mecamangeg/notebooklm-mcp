I. CAPTION
MINDANAO BUS COMPANY v. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-14078, February 24, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner, a common carrier transporting passengers and freight in Northern Mindanao, was investigated by an agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in 1953 [1]. The agent found that petitioner's freight tickets did not bear the required documentary stamps [1]. Because the used ticket booklets were numerous, torn, destroyed, and dumped in a bodega, making an actual count impossible, the agent used the "average method" [2, 3]. He examined 500 booklets, found an average of 2.61 freight tickets per booklet, and applied this average to the total number of booklets used [2, 3]. Assuming each ticket covered baggage valued over P5.00, the Respondent Collector assessed P15,704.16 in taxes [1]. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the assessment but removed the compromise penalty [4]. Petitioner appealed, questioning the assessment method, the value presumption, and the validity of the tax on freight tickets [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the "average method" of assessment was valid given the condition of the records.
2. W/N the Collector correctly presumed the value of goods covered by the tickets exceeded P5.00.
3. W/N freight tickets issued by a bus company are "bills of lading" subject to documentary stamp tax.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The "average method" was the only way to determine the number of tickets because an actual count was practically impossible due to the destroyed state of the booklets [3]. The burden of proof was on the petitioner to present evidence showing the inaccuracy of this method, which it failed to do [5, 6].

2. **YES.** It is a common practice for passengers in rural areas to demand receipts only for valuable cargo and not for cargoes of small value [7]. Therefore, the agent correctly assumed that if a freight ticket was issued, the baggage was valuable enough to exceed the P5.00 threshold [7].

3. **YES.** Freight tickets are regarded as bills of lading within the meaning of the Documentary Stamp Tax Law [6]. "Bills of lading" are not restricted to shipping by sea but comprehend all forms of transportation, including receipts for cargo transported by land [8]. Section 227 of the Tax Code, which imposes tax on receipts for goods shipped from one "place" to another, confirms the inclusion of land transportation [9]. The validity of the implementing regulation (Sec. 127, Reg. No. 26) is upheld under the principle of legislative approval by reenactment [10].

Petition denied. Decision affirmed [11].
