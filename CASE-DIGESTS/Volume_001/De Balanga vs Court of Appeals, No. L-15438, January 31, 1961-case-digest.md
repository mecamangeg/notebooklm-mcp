I. CAPTION
TEOPISTA B. DE BALANGA v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and LUIS MANALANG, G.R. No. L-15438, January 31, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Teopista B. de Balanga was the registered owner of a land and house covered by TCT No. 13363, registered as "Teopista B. de Balanga, married to Faustino A. Balanga." She obtained a loan from the Spouses Clemente but failed to pay. The spouses sued her for collection and specific performance; Teopista was declared in default, and the trial court ordered her to pay and allowed a levy on the land. Notably, her husband Faustino died in 1949, prior to the 1954 judgment.

The property was levied and sold at a public auction. Respondent Luis Manalang, who acted as counsel for the Clemente spouses, filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Manila (acting as a cadastral/land registration court) under Section 78 of Act No. 496, seeking the cancellation of Teopista's title and the issuance of a new one in his name. Teopista opposed the petition, arguing that: (1) the property was conjugal and the sale prejudiced her minor children; (2) the house was a family home; and (3) the sale to Manalang was void under the Civil Code prohibition against lawyers acquiring property in litigation. The cadastral court granted Manalang's petition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision *in toto*.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the cadastral court has jurisdiction to order the cancellation of a certificate of title and the issuance of a new one in favor of an execution sale purchaser when the registered owner raises serious objections regarding the validity of the sale and the nature of the property.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the issuance of a new title by the cadastral court to a judgment creditor or purchaser under Section 78 of Act No. 496 is not absolute. It is subject to the determination of any objection interposed relative to the validity of the proceedings leading to the transfer of the land.

The Court ruled that cadastral courts lack the jurisdiction to order the cancellation of a certificate of title and the issuance of a new one if there is no unanimity between the parties and a serious objection is interposed by a party in interest. In this case, Teopista raised substantive questions regarding the conjugal nature of the property, the rights of her minor children, the status of the house as a family home, and the validity of the sale to the respondent lawyer. These are controversial matters that must be threshed out in a separate, ordinary civil action, not in a summary proceeding before a cadastral court.

The decision appealed from was **SET ASIDE**, without prejudice to the petitioner filing the necessary action in the proper court within 30 days to determine the questions raised in her opposition.
