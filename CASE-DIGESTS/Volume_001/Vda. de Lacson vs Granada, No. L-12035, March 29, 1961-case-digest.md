I. CAPTION
**JOSEFITA T. VDA. DE LACSON, ET AL. v. SANTIAGO GRANADA, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-12035, March 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
The subject properties ("Hacienda San Jose") were originally leased by Joseph Arcache to respondent Santiago Granada on April 18, 1940, with an option to repurchase for P60,000.00 "Philippine currency" until May 31, 1944 [1]. On January 14, 1941, Arcache sold the properties to petitioners Balbinita T. de Lacson and Josefita T. Vda. de Lacson, subject to Granada's repurchase rights [1].

On April 4, 1944, petitioners (Josefita acting through her attorney-in-fact, Ricardo C. Lacson) executed a deed of sale reconveying the properties to Granada, who paid in Japanese military notes [2, 3]. On the same day, Granada sold the properties *pacto de retro* to intervenor Victorino Floro [2].

After the war, petitioners filed a suit to annul the 1944 sale, claiming: (1) lack of sufficient consideration because Japanese notes were not "Philippine currency"; (2) vitiated consent due to fear of the Japanese; and (3) lack of authority of the attorney-in-fact, as the special power of attorney instructed him to sell at the "best price obtainable" [3, 4]. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental upheld the validity of the sale, prompting this appeal [1, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the payment in Japanese military notes was valid despite the contract stipulation of "Philippine currency."
2. W/N the consent of the petitioners was vitiated by duress or intimidation during the Japanese occupation.
3. W/N the attorney-in-fact had the authority to execute the sale despite the "best price" instruction.
4. W/N the sale can be set aside for inadequacy of price.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The phrase "Philippine currency" in the pre-war contract was intended only to specify the currency of payment, not to exclude other legal tenders, considering the US dollar was also legal tender at the time [6]. Since Japanese military notes were legal tender in the Philippines in 1944, the payment was valid, consistent with the ruling in *Haw Pia v. China Banking Corp.* [6].

2. **NO.** A "general feeling of fear" or collective apprehension regarding the Japanese occupants is insufficient to nullify acts executed during the occupation [7]. There must be specific acts of such nature and magnitude as to have inflicted fear or terror upon the party, rendering the act involuntary [7]. No such specific acts of duress were proven in this case [7].

3. **YES.** While the power of attorney authorized Ricardo Lacson to sell at the "best price," this condition could not defeat Granada's superior pre-existing right to repurchase the property at the stipulated P60,000.00 [3]. Petitioners had purchased the land subject to this specific right, and the agent admitted the power of attorney was executed specifically to enable the reconveyance to Granada [3].

4. **NO.** In sales with a right of repurchase (*pacto de retro*), the price is usually fixed at a minimum to facilitate the vendor's repurchase [8]. Therefore, the transaction cannot be set aside solely on the ground that the repurchase price was inadequate or less than the real value of the property [8].

**Disposition:** Decision affirmed [9].
