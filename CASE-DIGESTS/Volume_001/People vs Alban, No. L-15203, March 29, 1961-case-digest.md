I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ALFREDO ALBAN, G.R. No. L-15203, March 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of July 16, 1956, in Agoo, La Union, Teofilo Boado and his wife Marcela Dacanay were awakened by two masked intruders. Marcela, who had lighted kerosene lamps, recognized the accused, Alfredo Alban, despite the handkerchief covering his face below the eyes, due to his exposed forehead and physical appearance. Alban shot Teofilo. Immediately after being shot, Teofilo told his wife and responding police officers to arrest "Fred," identifying him by his parents' names (Juan and Paer). The victim died shortly after at a hospital.

Alban raised the defense of alibi, claiming he was listening to a radio program at a neighbor's house and later sleeping at his uncle's house. He also argued that missing fingers on his right hand made it impossible for him to fire a gun. The Court of First Instance convicted him of murder, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the identification of the accused was sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
2. W/N the killing was qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the conviction, giving full credence to the positive identification by the victim's wife, who knew the accused well and saw him under sufficient lighting. Furthermore, the victim's statement naming the accused immediately after the shooting constitutes part of the **res gestae** [1]. The Court held that such a statement, made when the victim had no time to concoct a falsehood, is spontaneous and reflects the truth. The defense of alibi was rejected because the accused failed to prove it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime, which was only 500 meters away from his alleged location [2]. The Court also dismissed the claim regarding his physical deformity, noting he could have used his remaining fingers or his left hand [3].

2. **YES.** The killing is Murder qualified by **treachery**. The Court ruled that because the unarmed victim was shot suddenly and without warning, insuring the accomplishment of the crime without any risk to the accused arising from any defense the victim might have offered, treachery was present [4].

The judgment of the trial court is **AFFIRMED**.
