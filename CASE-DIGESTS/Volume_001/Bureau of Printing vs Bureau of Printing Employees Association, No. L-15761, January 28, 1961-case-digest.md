I. CAPTION
BUREAU OF PRINTING, SERAFIN SALVADOR and MARIANO LEDESMA v. THE BUREAU OF PRINTING EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (NLU), PACIFICO ADVINCULA, ROBERTO MENDOZA, PONCIANO ARGANDA and TEODULO TOLERAN, G.R. No. L-15761, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents, the Bureau of Printing Employees Association (NLU) and several employees, filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice against petitioners Bureau of Printing (BOP), its Director, and the Acting Secretary of General Services in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). They alleged interference with union rights and discrimination regarding hire and tenure. Petitioners moved to dismiss, arguing that the BOP is a government agency without juridical personality and not an industrial concern engaged in profit, and that the individual respondents were actually suspended pending administrative investigation for breach of Civil Service rules. The CIR trial judge denied the motion, ruling that the BOP's functions were "exclusively proprietary" because it accepted outside jobs and paid overtime. After the CIR *en banc* denied reconsideration, petitioners filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over the Bureau of Printing.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Bureau of Printing is an office of the Government created by the Administrative Code of 1916 and operates under the direct supervision of the Executive Secretary [1]. It is primarily a service bureau designed to meet the printing needs of the Government and is not engaged in business for pecuniary profit [1]. The Supreme Court held that the Industrial Peace Act applies only to industrial employment and employers engaged in industry for gain [2].

The Court rejected the CIR's view that the BOP is proprietary. The acceptance of private printing jobs (e.g., greeting cards, bank checks) is merely incidental to its governmental functions, done only upon request, and constitutes only one-half of 1 percent of its volume [3, 4]. Furthermore, the BOP charges for private work do not include profit [4].

Additionally, as a government office without juridical personality, the BOP cannot be sued (Sec. 1, Rule 3, Rules of Court) [5]. A suit against it is a suit against the Government, which cannot be sued without its consent [5]. Finally, the CIR cannot interfere with the authority of Heads of Departments to investigate and discipline government employees for administrative offenses, such as the insubordination alleged in this case [6].

The petition is granted, the orders complained of are set aside, and the complaint is dismissed.
