**I. CAPTION**
TORIBIA FONTANILLA PACIO, SANTIAGO PACIO, ESPERANZA PACIO, and ROSARIO PACIO v. MANUELA PACIO BILLON, BRIGIDA PACIO, and DOMINGA PACIO, G.R. No. L-15088, January 31, 1961, 1 SCRA 584, Bengzon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Flaviano Pacio married Severa Jucutan in 1901, producing the defendants. Before their marriage on June 4, 1901, Flaviano donated a parcel of land *propter nuptias* to Severa via a **private instrument**. Severa died in 1930. Flaviano subsequently married plaintiff Toribia Fontanilla, producing the other plaintiffs. Flaviano continued to declare the land in his name and paid taxes on it until his death in 1951. The parties lived together and shared the harvests equally. In 1956, the tax declarations were changed to the defendants' names.

The plaintiffs filed a case in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of La Union to recover the land. The CFI awarded the land to the defendants, ruling that a donation *propter nuptias* need not be in a public instrument to be valid between the donor and donee, applying the New Civil Code. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing the donation was void for lack of a public instrument under the law applicable at the time.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the donation *propter nuptias* of real property made in a private instrument in 1901 is valid.
2. W/N the defendants acquired ownership of the land through acquisitive prescription.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The donation is void. Since the donation was made in 1901, the Spanish Civil Code applies. Article 633 of the Spanish Civil Code mandates that for a donation of real property to be valid, it must be made in a **public instrument**. This requirement is essential for validity even between the parties, not just for registration or binding third persons. The Court cited *Velasquez v. Biala* and *Solis v. Barroso* to support this doctrine, holding that a private instrument is insufficient. The trial court erred in applying the principles of the New Civil Code (Arts. 127, 1403) to a 1901 transaction.

2. **NO.** Prescription did not lie because there was no adverse possession. The stipulation of facts showed that the parties shared harvests and lived together. Furthermore, under Article 1109 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, prescription by adverse possession cannot exist between husband and wife. Consequently, the land remained part of Flaviano Pacio's estate upon his death.

The decision is **MODIFIED**. The land is ordered returned to the lower court for partition among the heirs (children of both marriages) and the surviving spouse, Toribia Fontanilla.
