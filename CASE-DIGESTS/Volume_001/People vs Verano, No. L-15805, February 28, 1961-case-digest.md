I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JESUS VERANO, G.R. No. L-15805, February 28, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On June 22, 1953, Jesus Verano, driving a bus for Mindanao Bus Company, was involved in an accident resulting in the death of Dominador Paras and injuries to others. The Mindanao Bus Company paid Paras' heirs PHP 3,000.00, and the widow, acting for herself and her minor children, signed a waiver renouncing their right to ask for damages against the company.

Verano was charged and convicted by the Court of First Instance of Lanao for Homicide with multiple physical injuries through reckless imprudence. The trial court sentenced him to prison and ordered him to indemnify the heirs of Paras in the sum of PHP 5,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. Verano moved for reconsideration, arguing that the civil liability was extinguished by the heirs' waiver in favor of his employer. The trial court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the waiver of civil liability in favor of the employer extinguishes the personal civil liability of the employee.
2. W/N the widow can validly waive or compromise the civil indemnity due to her minor children without court approval.

IV. RULING
1. **YES (Pro Tanto).** While the driver is primarily liable, the employer is subsidiarily liable for felonies committed by employees in the discharge of their duties (Art. 103, Revised Penal Code). If the heirs could recover the full amount from the driver after being paid by the employer, it would result in double indemnity. Thus, the payment made by the employer must be credited to the civil liability of the accused. The waiver in favor of the employer generally includes the employee because the employer would otherwise be liable in the employee's default.

2. **NO.** Under Article 320 of the New Civil Code, while the widow is the legal administratrix of her minor children's property, she has no authority to compromise their claims for indemnity without court approval. A compromise is an act of strict ownership equivalent to alienation (*transigere est alienare*). Pursuant to Article 2032 of the New Civil Code, the court's approval is necessary for compromises entered into by parents or guardians. Consequently, the waiver signed by the widow on behalf of the minors is void insofar as it compromises their rights beyond what was paid.

**Disposition:** Since the trial court awarded PHP 5,000.00 and the employer only paid PHP 3,000.00, the heirs are entitled to the balance. The judgment is **MODIFIED**, reducing the indemnity to be paid by Verano to PHP 2,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
