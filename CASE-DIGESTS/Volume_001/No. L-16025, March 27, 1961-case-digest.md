**I. CAPTION**
FOOKIEN TIMES COMPANY, INC. and GO PUAN SENG v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and FLORA CRUZ GALLERO, G.R. No. L-16025, March 27, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Flora Cruz Gallero was employed by petitioner Fookien Times Company, Inc. from July 9, 1952, until her dismissal on September 5, 1958 [1]. On November 13, 1958, she filed a complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) seeking overtime pay, maternity pay, separation pay, and sick and vacation leave pay [1]. Petitioners moved to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction [2]. The CIR dismissed the claims for sick, vacation, and maternity leave pay but asserted jurisdiction over the separation and overtime pay claims, requiring petitioners to answer [2]. Petitioners filed the present petition for prohibition and *certiorari*, arguing the CIR lacks jurisdiction because Gallero did not seek reinstatement, did not allege unfair labor practice, nor claimed rights under a collective bargaining agreement [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over claims for separation pay and overtime pay when there is no claim for reinstatement or unfair labor practice.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) has no jurisdiction over the case. The Supreme Court ruled that where no claim is made for unfair labor practice or reinstatement, and there is no claim that the dismissed employee is a member of a labor organization with contractual rights against the company, the claims for separation pay and overtime compensation are considered ordinary claims for money [2, 4]. Such claims are cognizable in the ordinary courts of justice, not the CIR [2].

The Court applied the doctrine laid down in *Mindanao Bus Employees Labor Union v. Mindanao Bus Co.* and *Chua Workers' Union v. City Automotive Co.*, which held that the CIR lacks authority to determine petitions for overtime wages or separation pay absent an existing employer-employee relationship or a claim for reinstatement [2, 5, 6].

The writ was granted, and the CIR was enjoined from hearing the claims of respondent Gallero [7].
