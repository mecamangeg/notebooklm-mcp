I. CAPTION
YUTIVO SONS HARDWARE COMPANY v. COURT OF TAX APPEALS and COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-13203, January 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 160, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Yutivo Sons Hardware Co. (Yutivo) was an importer of cars and trucks. In June 1946, Southern Motors, Inc. (SM) was organized by the principal stockholders of Yutivo to sell vehicles in Visayas and Mindanao. Until mid-1947, Yutivo bought vehicles from General Motors (GM), the importer, who paid the sales tax. When GM withdrew, Yutivo became the importer and sold the vehicles to SM, paying sales tax on these initial sales. SM then sold to the public without paying further sales tax. The Collector of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed Yutivo for deficiency sales taxes and a fraud surcharge, arguing that SM was a mere instrumentality or dummy of Yutivo, and thus the tax should be based on the higher sales price of SM to the public. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, piercing the corporate veil of SM, but judges disagreed on the tax computation.

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the separate corporate personality of Southern Motors (SM) should be disregarded.
2. W/N Yutivo is liable for the 50% fraud surcharge for tax evasion.
3. W/N the government's right to assess the tax has prescribed.
4. W/N the sales tax should be computed based on SM's gross selling price without deducting the sales tax already billed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A corporation is generally a separate entity, but when it is used as a mere *alter ego* or business conduit, it may be disregarded to arrive at the true tax liability [1, 2]. The Court found that SM was effectively owned and controlled by Yutivo: Yutivo financed SM, controlled its board, handled its cash and accounting, and SM was dependent on Yutivo for its existence [3-9]. Thus, SM was a mere subsidiary or department of Yutivo, and its sales were rightly considered sales of Yutivo [10, 11].

2. **NO.** Fraud requires clear and convincing evidence, not mere suspicion [12-14]. SM was organized in 1946 when GM was still the importer, so there was no tax to evade at that time [12, 15]. A taxpayer has the legal right to reduce taxes by means the law permits (tax avoidance), which is distinct from tax evasion [16-18]. Yutivo honestly believed its method was valid, and the transactions were open and documented [19, 20]. The 50% fraud surcharge was improper [21-23].

3. **NO.** The assessment was made within the five-year period prescribed by Section 331 of the Tax Code. The initial assessment in 1950 was never finally withdrawn, merely remanded for reinvestigation [10, 11, 24]. Furthermore, Yutivo is estopped from claiming prescription because it requested several reinvestigations, which delayed the collection of the tax [25-27].

4. **NO.** While the tax base is the gross selling price of SM (as Yutivo's adjunct), the amount intended to cover the sales tax must be deducted if it was billed to the purchaser as a separate item, pursuant to General Circulars Nos. 431 and 440 [21, 22, 28]. To include the tax in the gross selling price would be unfair and amount to a tax on a tax [29, 30].

**Disposition**: Decision modified. Petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the sum of P820,549.91, plus 25% surcharge thereon for late payment.
