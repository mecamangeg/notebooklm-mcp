I. CAPTION
RUFINO O. ABUDA v. AUDITOR GENERAL, G.R. No. L-16071, April 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Rufino O. Abuda, the Justice of the Peace of General MacArthur and Quinapundan, Samar, was convicted of libel on July 28, 1952. He did not appeal the conviction. Consequently, he was indefinitely suspended from office by an administrative order on November 3, 1952. Following an administrative investigation conducted by Judge Fernandez of the Court of First Instance of Samar acting as the President's delegate, the Judge recommended Abuda's exoneration. Acting on this recommendation, the President issued Administrative Order No. 182 on March 6, 1956, ordering petitioner’s reinstatement "but without right to salary during the period of suspension." The President reasoned that while the offense did not involve moral turpitude, the conviction reflected on his fitness, and the suspension without pay was sufficient punishment. Abuda claimed his back salaries for the period of suspension, but the Auditor General denied the claim.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is entitled to back salaries upon his reinstatement.
2. W/N the President encroached upon the judiciary's powers by ignoring the investigating Judge's recommendation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that under the second paragraph of Section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code, the payment of salary to an officer suspended by the President upon reinstatement rests "at the discretion of the officer by whom the suspension was effected." Since the President expressly ordered the reinstatement "without right to salary," the Court cannot substitute its discretion for that of the President. The Court further clarified that the petitioner's reinstatement was not an exoneration but a commutation of punishment. Additionally, Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260, which the petitioner invoked, could not apply retroactively to his suspension in 1952.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there was no encroachment on the judiciary because the Judge of the Court of First Instance, when investigating the administrative complaint, was acting not as a presiding magistrate but merely as a delegate of the President. Thus, the President was not bound by the Judge's recommendation.

**Decision affirmed.**
