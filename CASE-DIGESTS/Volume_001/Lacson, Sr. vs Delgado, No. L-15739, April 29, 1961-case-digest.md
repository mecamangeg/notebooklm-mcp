I. CAPTION
INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE MARTIN EMILIANO LACSON, JR.; EMILIANO LACSON, SR. v. JACINTO DELGADO, G.R. No. L-15739, April 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Emiliano Lacson, Sr. (father and heir) and Jacinto Delgado (reservee) filed a joint petition for the settlement of the intestate estate of Martin Emiliano Lacson, Jr. They agreed that the funeral expenses, totaling P9,345.00 (advanced by both parties), would be paid proportionately and annually from two-thirds of the harvest of the estate's lands [1]. However, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo subsequently issued orders directing the administrator to sell the estate's property within a specific period to pay the obligations, rather than waiting for the harvest proceeds [2, 3]. Delgado appealed, arguing that the court should have abided by their agreement regarding the manner of payment instead of ordering a sale [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the lower court erred in ordering the sale of estate property to pay debts despite the parties' prior agreement to pay them from annual harvests.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court set aside the lower court's orders. The Court held that the administrator must strictly comply with the agreement entered into with the appellant at the initiation of the proceedings [4]. This agreement constitutes a judicial compromise which has the effect of a judgment under Article 2067 of the Civil Code [4]. Consequently, no partition should be decreed and no sale of the property should be ordered until the claims for funeral expenses have been paid in accordance with the stipulations of the compromise [4, 5].

The orders appealed from were SET ASIDE, and the lower court was enjoined to follow the compromise [6].
