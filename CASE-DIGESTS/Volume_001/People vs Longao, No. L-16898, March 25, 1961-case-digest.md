I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILANDER LONGAO, G.R. No. L-16898, March 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Philander Longao was charged with homicide thru reckless imprudence before the Justice of the Peace Court of Bontoc, Mountain Province. Upon arraignment, he pleaded guilty but sought to prove voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance. The lower court convicted him, sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty and ordering the payment of indemnity and moral damages [1]. Longao appealed this decision directly to the Supreme Court. While the appeal was pending, Longao petitioned the Court to substitute his personal bond with a surety bond. During the review of this bond petition, the Supreme Court noticed that the case originated from the Justice of the Peace Court and was appealed directly to them [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from a Justice of the Peace Court is proper when questions of law are involved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that an appeal from a decision of a Justice of the Peace Court (now municipal court), even if it involves questions of law, cannot be made directly to the Supreme Court [3]. Under Rule 40 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from an inferior court must be taken to the Court of First Instance [2].

The present appeal was **DISMISSED**, and the petition for approval of the substituted bond was **DENIED** [4].
