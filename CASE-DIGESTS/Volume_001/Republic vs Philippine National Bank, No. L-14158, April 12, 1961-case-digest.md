I. CAPTION
**REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-14158, April 12, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On January 16, 1950, the Republic of the Philippines instituted expropriation proceedings for 54 lots needed for the construction of Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City. One of the lots was Lot 795-B-3-A (14,026 sq. m.) owned by defendant Vicente J. Francisco and mortgaged to the Philippine Bank of Communications. The complaint was amended on January 9, 1952, and the Republic took possession of the property on March 26, 1952, after depositing the provisional value.

The Court of First Instance of Rizal appointed commissioners to determine just compensation. One commissioner recommended P18.00/sq. m. plus consequential damages, while two others recommended P6.00/sq. m. The lower court rendered judgment fixing the value at P10.00/sq. m. with interest on the full amount, and deducted the provisional deposit. Both parties appealed; the Republic questioned the value and damages, while Francisco claimed a higher amount.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the just compensation should be determined as of the date of the taking or the date of the filing of the complaint.
2. W/N the owner is entitled to consequential damages.
3. W/N the owner is required to pay interest on the amount already withdrawn. (Addressed as: W/N interest is due on the full amount of compensation).
4. W/N the owner must cause the cancellation of the mortgage on the expropriated property.

IV. RULING
1. **AS OF THE DATE OF FILING.** The Court held that when the taking of the property coincides with or is subsequent to the commencement of the proceedings, the value should be fixed as of the date of the filing of the complaint [1]. Here, the complaint was filed in 1950 (amended 1952) while possession was taken in March 1952 [2]. Thus, the filing date controls. Regarding the amount, the Court reduced the award to P6.00/sq. m., noting that Francisco's own answer alleged a value of P5.00/sq. m., and an adjacent lot owned by Claro M. Recto was expropriated at P6.00/sq. m. [3].

2. **NO.** Consequential damages were denied because the consequential benefits derived by the remaining property (access to the new highway and increased land value) more than offset the alleged damages [4]. The Court found the claim for a destroyed fence unsubstantiated and attributed the loss of fruit trees to neighbors rather than the government [5], [4].

3. **NO.** Interest should not accrue on the sum already collected by the defendant. It should be charged only on the difference between the aggregate compensation adjudicated and the amount already withdrawn/received by the defendant [6].

4. **YES.** It is the duty of the landowner to free the property from any encumbrance, as the government has the right to acquire the expropriated property free from liens [6].

**Disposition:** Decision modified. Plaintiff is ordered to pay P6.00/sq. m. with 6% interest on the unpaid balance; Defendant is ordered to cancel the encumbrance on the property.
