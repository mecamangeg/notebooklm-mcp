I. CAPTION
ANTONIO MEDINA v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-15113, January 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio Medina married Antonia Rodriguez in 1944. Subsequently, he acquired forest concessions and sold logs to his wife, who had started a lumber business. She, in turn, sold the logs through the same agent used by Petitioner, Mariano Osorio, and the proceeds were often deposited into Petitioner’s bank account [1]. The Collector of Internal Revenue (Respondent) assessed Petitioner for deficiency sales taxes, considering the sales to his wife null and void under Article 1490 of the Civil Code [2]. Consequently, the Respondent treated the wife’s sales as Petitioner’s original taxable sales [2]. Petitioner protested, claiming for the first time in 1954 that he and his wife had a pre-nuptial agreement for absolute separation of property, but the document was lost during the war [3, 4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) upheld the assessment, ruling that the pre-nuptial agreement was not proven and that the sales were simulated [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the sales made by Petitioner to his wife are valid.
2. W/N secondary evidence is admissible to prove the alleged lost pre-nuptial agreement.
3. W/N illegally seized documents are admissible in evidence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Contracts violative of Article 1490 of the Civil Code are void [6]. The Court held that Articles 7 and 10 of the Code of Commerce, which presume a wife's authority to engage in business, do not constitute exceptions to the prohibition against sales between spouses found in Article 1490 [7, 8]. Since the sales were void, the Respondent correctly disregarded them and treated the wife's transactions as the original taxable sales of the Petitioner [9]. Furthermore, the sales were found to be fictitious as the proceeds were deposited in Petitioner's account [10].

2. **NO.** Under the **Best Evidence Rule**, little or no credence can be given to oral testimony as secondary evidence to prove the contents of a lost document unless every copy of the supposed agreement is accounted for as lost [11, 12]. Here, Petitioner failed to account for the copy allegedly filed with the Clerk of Court [13]. Additionally, the claim was incredible because the spouses had no property at the time of marriage to warrant such an agreement, and they did not observe separation of property in their actual dealings [10].

3. **YES.** (Based on jurisprudence applicable at the time). Illegally obtained documents and papers are admissible in evidence if they are found to be competent and relevant to the case [14, 15]. The Court cited *Wong & Lee v. Collector of Internal Revenue* to support this, although it noted the Respondent denied the seizure was illegal [16].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J., concurring:**
 concurred in the result but disagreed with the majority regarding the admissibility of illegally seized evidence. Citing *Weeks v. United States* and the Fourth Amendment, he argued that documents obtained through unlawful search and seizure should not be admissible, as doing so sacrifices constitutional rights [17, 18].
