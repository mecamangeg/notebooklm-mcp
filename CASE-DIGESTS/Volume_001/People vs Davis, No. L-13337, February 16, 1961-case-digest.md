I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JAMES DAVIS**, G.R. No. L-13337, February 16, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of April 18, 1954, Alfredo Estepa attended a dance in Naguilian, La Union. At around 12:30 a.m., as Alfredo was walking home along the Naguilian-Bagulin road, the accused, James Davis, suddenly appeared. Without any word or warning, Davis pulled out a knife and stabbed Alfredo in the abdomen [1]. Alfredo died shortly thereafter [2]. Davis admitted to the stabbing but claimed self-defense, alleging that Alfredo had boxed him, sat on his stomach, and tried to strangle him, forcing him to pull the knife from his back pocket to defend himself [3]. The Court of First Instance of La Union rejected this defense, found Davis guilty of murder, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in valid self-defense.
2. W/N the crime committed is murder qualified by treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the accused failed to prove self-defense. Self-defense must be established by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence (*People v. Gimena, 59 Phil. 509*) [4]. The Court found the defense's version physically improbable; it was "infinitely difficult" for the accused to draw a knife from his back pocket while the deceased was allegedly straddling him and raining blows [5]. Furthermore, the accused's testimony was inconsistent, and the injuries he sustained were reasonably attributed to the retaliatory beating given by the victim's brother immediately after the stabbing [6].

2. **YES.** The crime is murder qualified by treachery. The accused intercepted the victim at midnight and stabbed him suddenly and unexpectedly without any warning [7]. This ensured the victim had no chance to defend himself, constituting treachery [7, 8].

The appealed decision is **AFFIRMED** with the **MODIFICATION** that the indemnity to the heirs of the deceased is raised from P4,000 to P6,000 [7].
