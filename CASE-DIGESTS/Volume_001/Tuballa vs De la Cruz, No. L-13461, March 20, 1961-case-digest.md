I. CAPTION
PEDRO TUBALLA v. MARIA DE LA CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13461, March 20, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On June 1, 1957, Pedro Tuballa filed a complaint against Maria De La Cruz, et al. to annul Original Certificate of Title No. P-2026 on the ground of fraud. The Title was issued by the Register of Deeds on March 8, 1954, pursuant to Sales Patent No. V-1129 issued on November 16, 1953. Previously, Tuballa filed Civil Case No. 1430 regarding the same subject matter, which was dismissed for his "lack of legal personality." The Court of First Instance of Davao dismissed the new complaint on the grounds that the cause of action was barred by the prior final judgment (*res judicata*) and for lack of jurisdiction. Tuballa appealed, arguing the prior dismissal was not an adjudication on the merits and that the prescriptive period should be counted from the issuance of the title, not the patent.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the dismissal of the previous case for lack of legal personality constitutes *res judicata*.
2. W/N the action for review on the ground of fraud was filed within the prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that a dismissal predicated on lack of legal personality (under Section 4, Rule 30 or Section 1, Rule 8 of the Old Rules of Court) operates as an adjudication on the merits, unless the court expressly directs that the dismissal is without prejudice. Since the dismissal was not based on lack of jurisdiction and was not expressly made without prejudice, it bars another action between the same parties on the same subject matter.

2. **NO.** The action was filed out of time. The Supreme Court held that the one-year period to review a decree in a registration proceeding on the ground of fraud must be computed from the **date of the issuance of the patent**, not from the issuance of the corresponding certificate of title (*Sumail v. Court of First Instance of Cotabato*). The patent was issued on November 16, 1953, while the complaint was filed only on June 1, 1957, well beyond the one-year period. Even if the time the former case was pending were deducted, the remaining period would still exceed one year.

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED.
