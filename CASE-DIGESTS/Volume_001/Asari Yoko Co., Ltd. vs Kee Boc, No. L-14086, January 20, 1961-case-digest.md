**I. CAPTION**
ASARI YOKO CO., LTD. v. KEE BOC and CELEDONIO AGRAVA, Director of Patents, G.R. No. L-14086, January 20, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
On August 27, 1953, Respondent Kee Boc, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition to register the trademark "RACE" and design (three men running) for shirts and undershirts, claiming first use in commerce on May 17, 1952. Petitioner Asari Yoko Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation, opposed the application, alleging that it owned the trademark, having registered it in Japan in 1937 and used it in the Philippines before World War II and continuously since 1949.

The Director of Patents dismissed the opposition and adjudged Kee Boc as the owner. The Director ruled that Asari Yoko failed to prove pre-war registration in the Philippines and that any rights were lost due to the war. Furthermore, the Director held that Asari Yoko could not have established valid use in commerce after the war because there was no formal trade agreement between the Philippines and Japan at the time the goods allegedly entered. Asari Yoko appealed to the Supreme Court.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N Asari Yoko is the rightful owner of the trademark entitled to protection against Kee Boc’s application based on prior use.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the Director of Patents' decision.

The Court found conclusive evidence that the trademark was registered by the Petitioner in Japan in 1937 and had been used on goods imported into the Philippines as early as 1949 [1]. Physical evidence showed that the facsimile submitted by Kee Boc was actually a label from the Petitioner's Japanese goods, where Kee Boc had pasted paper over the words "Registered Trade Mark" and "Made in Occupied Japan" [2].

Regarding the legality of trade, the Court held that even prior to the formal trade agreement between the Philippines and Japan in 1951, the entry of goods was legal because Japan was under the lawful control of the United States (SCAP), with whom the Philippines had commercial relations [3]. The lawful entry of goods bearing the trademark entitled the owner to the right to use the same to the exclusion of others [4]. The Court emphasized that "modern trade and commerce demands that depredations on legitimate trademarks of aliens should not be countenanced" and that requiring a formal commercial agreement before recognizing a trademark is inconsistent with modern freedom of trade [4]. As the first user of the trademark in the Philippines, Asari Yoko would be damaged by the registration in favor of Kee Boc [5].

The decision of the Director of Patents is **REVERSED**, and Kee Boc's application is **DISMISSED**.
