**I. CAPTION**
LUIS PINEDA v. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF DAVAO, ESMERTO UNSON, in his capacity as Provincial Sheriff Ex-Oficio of Davao, and POTENCIANA PLANDO, G.R. No. L-12602, April 25, 1961, Concepcion, J.

**II. FACTS**
Potenciana Plando filed Civil Case No. 959 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Davao against Luis Pineda and Bruno Ramirez to recover possession and ownership of a parcel of land. She alleged that she inherited the land from her late husband, Domingo Ramirez, whose homestead application was approved in 1930 with an order for patent issuance in 1932, thereby vesting him with equitable ownership. Pineda and Ramirez failed to answer and were declared in default. The CFI rendered a decision declaring Plando the lawful owner and ordering defendants to vacate the premises.

After failing to secure relief from the default judgment through a petition for certiorari, Pineda filed a separate action (the subject of this appeal) to annul the portion of the decision in Civil Case No. 959 regarding ownership. Pineda argued that the determination of ownership over public lands is the exclusive function of the Bureau of Lands, where a controversy between the parties was allegedly pending. The lower court ruled in Pineda's favor, nullifying the previous decision on the ground that courts lack jurisdiction to determine the ownership of agricultural lands. Plando appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance had jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the homestead land in Civil Case No. 959 despite the alleged pendency of an administrative controversy.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the pleadings. The complaint in Civil Case No. 959 alleged that the homestead application had been approved and the issuance of a patent ordered, indicating compliance with legal requirements. Consequently, the applicant acquired a vested property right and equitable ownership, which may be conveyed or inherited unaffected by the government's paramount title (*Balboa v. Farrales*).

While the Director of Lands has control over the disposition of public domain (Commonwealth Act No. 141), the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies merely implies the absence of a "cause of action" and does not negate the court's "jurisdiction" over the subject matter or parties. Courts of First Instance are vested with original jurisdiction in civil actions involving title to real property under Republic Act No. 296, Section 44. Since the court had jurisdiction, the decision in Civil Case No. 959, having become final and executory, is valid and binding.

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the complaint is dismissed.
