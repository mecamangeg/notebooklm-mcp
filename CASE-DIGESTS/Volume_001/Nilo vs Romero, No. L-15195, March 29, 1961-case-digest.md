**I. CAPTION**
**ANUNCIACION NARABAL DE NILO, GIL NILO, FELICISIMO NILO, FILEMON NILO, ET AL. v. HON. HONORIO ROMERO, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Davao, Br. III and the CITY OF DAVAO**, G.R. No. L-15195, March 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Fausto Nilo filed a civil case against the City of Davao, represented by the City Engineer, to recover payment for land used by the City as a roadway [1]. The City, through its Special Counsel, filed its answer late and was declared in default by the trial court [1, 2]. The City’s motion for reconsideration was denied, and it did not appeal the order [2]. Following Fausto’s death, his heirs (petitioners) substituted him and filed an amended complaint [3].

Three years after the default order, the trial court rendered a judgment by default ordering the City to pay the petitioners [3]. A writ of execution was issued [3]. Subsequently, the City filed a "Petition for Relief from Judgment," claiming for the first time that the court lacked jurisdiction because summons was served on the City Engineer instead of the City Mayor, as required by the City Charter [3]. Respondent Judge Romero granted the petition and set aside the default judgment [4]. Petitioners filed a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court [5].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the City of Davao despite the alleged defect in the service of summons.
2. W/N the City of Davao is guilty of laches and barred from filing a Petition for Relief from Judgment.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Jurisdiction over the parties is acquired by voluntary appearance in court or by submitting pleadings [5-7]. The appearance of the City Attorney and Special Counsel for the City of Davao constituted a voluntary appearance sufficient in law to confer jurisdiction upon the court [5, 6]. If the City believed it was wrongly represented, it should have filed a motion to dismiss immediately; failing to do so, the doctrine of estoppel operates against it [5, 8, 9]. The technical error in designating the representative (City Engineer instead of Mayor) was cured by the City's active participation and is insufficient to invalidate the proceedings [5, 10].

2. **YES.** The City is guilty of laches. Under Rule 38, specific periods are provided for filing a Petition for Relief [10]. In this case, more than three years elapsed from the order of default (October 20, 1955) to the filing of the petition for relief (November 17, 1958) without the City taking opportune action to protect itself [9, 10]. Since the default judgment had already become final and executory, the trial court lost jurisdiction to set it aside [10].

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders of the respondent judge are SET ASIDE, and the default judgment of October 28, 1958 is ORDERED REVISED and EXECUTED [4].
