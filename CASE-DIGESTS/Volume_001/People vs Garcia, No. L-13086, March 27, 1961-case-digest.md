**I. CAPTION**
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CEFERINA FLORES DE GARCIA, ET AL., G.R. Nos. L-13086 and L-13087, March 27, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On the early morning of June 13, 1956, in Umingan, Pangasinan, a group of armed persons forced their way into the house of Sui Chuy and his nearby warehouse [1]. The robbers took cash and valuables worth P4,830.00 from Sui Chuy [1]. During the robbery, Maria Madamba, who was in a nearby store, was shot in the head and killed [1].

The accused were divided into two groups: Ceferina Flores de Garcia, Emiliano Micu, Tirso Mirandi, and state witness Alberto Delima entered the house, while Oftaciano Manalo, Rufino Vino, and Francisco Tejada broke into the warehouse [2]. Prosecution witnesses, including the victim Sui Chuy and confederate-turned-state-witness Delima, positively identified the accused [2, 3].

The accused raised defenses of alibi and coercion. Ceferina Flores claimed she and her companions were hijacked by unknown robbers and forced to go to the scene [4]. Others claimed to be at a town auditorium or municipal building during the crime [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted all accused of robbery with homicide and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [7].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the accused are liable for robbery with homicide committed pursuant to a conspiracy.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that the accused acted in conspiracy, evinced by their concerted action and unity of criminal design in pursuance of a common objective [8]. Consequently, under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, all principals are liable for the crime of robbery with homicide, including the killing of Maria Madamba which was committed "on the occasion" of the robbery [8].

The Court rejected the defenses of alibi, ruling that inherently weak alibis cannot prevail over positive identification by witnesses [9]. Specifically, the Court found Ceferina Flores' claim of coercion unbelievable, noting her participation in ransacking the house and her unnatural behavior during the incident [10, 11]. Although evidence pointed to Emiliano Micu as the actual shooter of Madamba, the existence of a conspiracy rendered all appellants collectively liable for the homicide [8, 12].

The judgment of the lower court was **MODIFIED** only to order the appellants, jointly and solidarily, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Maria Madamba in the sum of P6,000.00, which the trial court had failed to include [8, 13]. The sentence of *reclusion perpetua* was affirmed [7, 8].
