I. CAPTION
TAN YU CHIN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15775, April 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 11, 1958, Tan Yu Chin filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Leyte [1]. Subsequently, on July 6, 1959, he moved to dismiss his own petition, claiming he was already a Filipino citizen by virtue of being born in Jolo, Sulu in 1896 to a Filipino mother and a Chinese father who were not legally married [1, 2]. The trial court rendered judgment declaring Tan Yu Chin a Filipino citizen and dismissing the application for naturalization as "unnecessary" [3]. The Government, through the Provincial Fiscal, appealed this decision [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a court can make a judicial declaration that a petitioner is a Filipino citizen in a naturalization proceeding.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Under Philippine laws, there can be no action or proceeding for the judicial declaration of the citizenship of an individual [4]. Courts exist to settle justiciable controversies involving legally demandable rights and remedies; while a court may pass upon a person's status (e.g., citizenship) as an incident to the adjudication of rights in a controversy, it cannot institute a proceeding solely to declare that a person is a Filipino citizen [4].

The Supreme Court applied the doctrine in *Danilo Channie Tan v. Republic* (G.R. No. L-14159), noting that a petition for naturalization prays for *admission* into the citizenry, implying the petitioner is not yet a citizen [4, 5]. Consequently, the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction when it declared the petitioner a citizen, as the issue was not raised in the pleadings [5, 6]. This decision expressly overrules previous rulings, such as in *Pablo y Sen v. Republic*, which had permitted such declarations if the evidence warranted it [6].

The judgment appealed from is SET ASIDE [7].
