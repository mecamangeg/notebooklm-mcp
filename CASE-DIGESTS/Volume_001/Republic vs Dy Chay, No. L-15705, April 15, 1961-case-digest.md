**I. CAPTION**
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. DY CHAY, G.R. No. L-15705, April 15, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Defendant-Appellee Dy Chay was assessed a deficiency income tax of P24,588.00 plus surcharge and interest [1]. He requested a reinvestigation, but the Collector of Internal Revenue upheld the assessment and demanded payment [1]. Dy Chay neither paid the tax nor appealed the decision to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) [1]. The Collector subsequently filed an action for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal [1]. Dy Chay moved to dismiss, arguing that with the enactment of Republic Act No. 1125 creating the CTA, ordinary courts lost jurisdiction over cases involving the collection of internal revenue taxes [2]. The trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, and the Republic appealed [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to entertain a judicial action for the collection of taxes when the taxpayer fails to appeal the assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** Under Sections 7 and 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, the CTA only assumes exclusive appellate jurisdiction over a disputed assessment if the taxpayer adversely affected brings the case before it within 30 days [3, 4]. The law grants the right to appeal only to the taxpayer, not to the Government [4, 5].

The Supreme Court ruled that when a taxpayer neither pays the tax nor contests its validity before the CTA, the only remedy left to the Government—aside from distraint and levy—is to enforce collection through judicial action in the ordinary courts of justice [6, 7]. To hold otherwise would be absurd and unfair, as it would deprive the Government of its judicial remedy to collect taxes [7].

The order appealed from is set aside, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings [8].
