I. CAPTION
PISINGAN CHIONG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-15313, March 25, 1961, Bengzon, Acting C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 31, 1956, the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga granted Pisingan Chiong’s petition for naturalization [1]. The City Attorney appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court approved the grant on April 16, 1958 [1]. On September 22, 1958, Chiong filed a motion to take his oath of allegiance, arguing that the two-year probationary period prescribed by Republic Act No. 530 should be counted from the promulgation of the lower court’s decision in January 1956 [1]. The City Attorney opposed the motion, contending that the two-year period had not yet elapsed from the Supreme Court's decision in April 1958 [1]. The lower court, presided by Judge Montejo, denied the petition based on the ruling in *Republic v. Makalintal* [2]. Chiong appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the two-year period prescribed by Republic Act No. 530 should be computed from the date of the lower court's decision rather than the date the Supreme Court decision became final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's order, ruling that the two-year period provided in Republic Act No. 530 must be computed from the date the decision of the Supreme Court becomes final, not from the date the decision of the lower court was promulgated [3, 4]. The Court adhered to the doctrine established in *Republic v. Makalintal* and *Uy v. Republic*, which holds that when a naturalization case is appealed, the decision of the Supreme Court constitutes the law of the case and does not have retroactive effect [2, 5]. Consequently, the petitioner's attempt to take the oath in September 1958 was premature as two years had not elapsed since the Supreme Court's approval in April 1958.

The Order is **AFFIRMED** [2, 5].
