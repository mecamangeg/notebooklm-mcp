I. CAPTION
MAMERTO DAILISAN, ET AL. v. SEBASTIAN SO ENG SO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12173, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Mamerto Dailisan and Felicidad Romero filed a civil action for damages in the Court of First Instance of Davao against Sebastian So Eng So, Yao Lam, and Bernardo Libawan [1]. This action stemmed from a criminal conviction of Libawan for homicide through reckless imprudence, where the plaintiffs reserved their right to a separate civil action [1]. The plaintiffs sought a total of P67,000.00 covering damages, funeral expenses, and attorney's fees [1]. While Libawan admitted liability, his co-defendants denied that he was their employee [2]. On February 13, 1957, the Court of Appeals elevated the case to the Supreme Court because the amount in controversy exceeded P50,000.00, which was the jurisdictional limit at that time [3]. However, while the case was pending decision, the Judiciary Act was amended, increasing the Court of Appeals' jurisdictional amount to P200,000.00 [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over the case considering the amendment to the Judiciary Act.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the case falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [4]. The Court noted that the principal question raised is factual—specifically, whether Bernardo Libawan was an employee of Sebastian So Eng So [5]. Furthermore, the action is for the recovery of P67,000.00 [5]. Since the Judiciary Act was amended to increase the jurisdictional amount for the Court of Appeals to not more than P200,000.00, the amount in controversy is now within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals [3, 5].

Accordingly, the case was **REMANDED** to the Court of Appeals [5].
