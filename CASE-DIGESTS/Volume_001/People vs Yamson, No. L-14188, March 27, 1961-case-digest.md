I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. EUTIQUIO YAMSON, G.R. No. L-14188, March 27, 1961, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
Eutiquio Yamson was charged with murder qualified by treachery and attended by at least five aggravating circumstances, including quasi-recidivism [1]. On March 12, 1958, the trial court appointed Atty. Bartolome Felipe as counsel *de oficio* [2]. Upon arraignment on March 15, 1958, assisted by counsel, Yamson pleaded guilty to the information, while his co-accused pleaded not guilty [2].

On May 31, 1958, the trial court rendered judgment finding Yamson guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The court appreciated the plea of guilty as a single mitigating circumstance, which was insufficient to offset the aggravating circumstances [3]. Yamson was sentenced to death and ordered to indemnify the heirs of the offended party in the sum of P3,000 [3]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court *en consulta* due to the death penalty imposed [4]. No specific question was raised on appeal, but the Supreme Court reviewed the record to ensure the plea was made with knowledge of its meaning [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in accepting the plea of guilty to a capital offense without taking further evidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the plea of guilty was valid and the death penalty was correctly imposed [1]. The Court noted that Yamson was assisted by counsel *de oficio* during the plea, and there was no evidence that counsel failed to advise him properly [5]. Furthermore, from the arraignment on March 15 until the promulgation of judgment on May 31, neither Yamson nor his counsel complained that the plea was not fully understood [6].

The Court established that it lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge whether to take evidence or not in a case where he is satisfied that a plea of guilty has been entered with full knowledge of its meaning and consequences [7, 8]. The presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions by counsel *de oficio* was not overcome [5].

Judgment modified.
