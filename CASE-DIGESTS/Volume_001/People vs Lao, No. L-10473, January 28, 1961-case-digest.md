**I. CAPTION**
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROSARIO LAO and ALBERTO PADIAMAT, G.R. No. L-10473, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
Rosario Lao and her husband Vicente Lao owned a poultry farm. Vicente had a mistress, Rosa Baltazar, who lived on the farm. Believing Rosa brought bad luck to their business, Rosario induced Ben Santos and appellant Alberto Padiamat to eliminate Rosa by providing money for their expenses and promising a reward. On December 7, 1953, Santos and Padiamat took Rosa from the farm, killed her nearby, and buried her body. Padiamat later confessed, detailing how they received money from Rosario and executed the crime. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted Rosario and Padiamat of kidnapping with murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. They appealed, questioning the credibility of the state witness and the nature of the crime.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the crime committed is kidnapping with murder.
2. W/N Rosario Lao is criminally liable as a principal by induction.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that the crime is **Murder**, not kidnapping with murder. Citing *People v. Camo*, the Court explained that the taking of the victim from her house and killing her at a distance of six to ten meters away constitutes murder because the conspirators' specific intent was to commit murder, not to kidnap or detain her first and kill her later [1], [2].

2. **YES.** Rosario Lao is liable as a principal by induction. The Court found she induced the killing of her husband's mistress by giving money to the killers (price or reward). Her liability was attended by the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation [3], [2]. Padiamat is liable as a principal by direct participation, aggravated by evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, nocturnity, and price or reward. Although Padiamat deserved the death penalty, the lack of sufficient votes resulted in the imposition of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Judgment affirmed.**

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
Justices Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, J.B.L. Reyes, Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes, and Dizon concurred with the decision. [4]
