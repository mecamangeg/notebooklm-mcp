I. CAPTION
VALERIO P. TRIA v. WENCESLAO A. LIRAG, G.R. No. L-13994, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Tria (substituting Delgado) and defendant Lirag entered into a compromise agreement to settle a case involving a land sale. Under the agreement, Tria was to pay Lirag P13,500.00 by December 31, 1955, to rescind the sale and recover the land [1]. The Court of First Instance approved the compromise and rendered judgment in conformity with it on December 23, 1954 [2]. Tria failed to pay by the deadline. Lirag moved for execution, which Tria opposed, claiming Lirag violated the agreement by refusing to lend the title necessary for Tria to raise funds [3, 4]. The lower court rejected this excuse and granted the execution on June 5, 1956; Tria did not appeal this order [5]. When an alias writ of execution was issued in 1958, Tria moved to set it aside, arguing that the compromise was merely a contract enforceable only by a separate action for specific performance, not by execution [5, 6]. The lower court denied the motion, prompting this appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Tria is barred from questioning the writ of execution based on the alleged breach of the compromise.
2. W/N a compromise agreement approved by the court may be enforced by a writ of execution.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that it was too late for Tria to question the alias writ or invoke the alleged breach of the compromise agreement. Tria failed to appeal the order of June 5, 1956, which originally granted the motion for execution and overruled his opposition. By allowing that order to become final and executory, he is estopped from raising the same issues against the alias writ issued more than a year later [5].

2. **YES.** A compromise agreement submitted to the court for approval with a request for judgment is "more than a contract" [6]. Once approved and incorporated into the decision, it becomes part and parcel of the judgment. Therefore, under Article 2037 of the Civil Code, it may be enforced as a judgment by a writ of execution, rather than requiring a separate action for specific performance [6].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [7].
