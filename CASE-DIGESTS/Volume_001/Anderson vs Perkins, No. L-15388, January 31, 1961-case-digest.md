I. CAPTION
DORA PERKINS ANDERSON v. IDONAH SLADE PERKINS, G.R. No. L-15388, January 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Eugene Arthur Perkins died in Manila on April 28, 1956. Dora Perkins Anderson (Petitioner) filed a petition for the probate of his will and for the appointment of Alfonso Ponce Enrile as special administrator [1]. On September 4, 1958, the special administrator petitioned the court for authority to sell certain personal effects (clothes, books, gadgets, appliances), alleging they were physically deteriorating and losing value [2]. Idonah Slade Perkins (Oppositor), the surviving spouse, opposed the sale, arguing that the properties were not perishable and that most of the items were conjugal property or her separate exclusive property [3]. The lower court approved the sale [3]. Idonah moved for reconsideration, citing Rule 81, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, but the motion was denied [3, 4]. She appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a special administrator is authorized to sell personal property that is not perishable.
2. W/N the court properly authorized the sale of personal property despite the surviving spouse's claim that the items were conjugal or her exclusive property.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** A special administrator's power to sell is not limited to "perishable" property only. Rule 81, Section 2 of the Rules of Court specifically provides that the special administrator "may sell such perishable *and other property* as the court orders sold" [4]. The function of a special administrator is to preserve not only the specific property of the estate but also its value [5]. Thus, they may be empowered to sell non-perishable personal property to prevent depreciation [6].

2. **NO.** The proposed sale was premature because the issue of ownership had not yet been decided. The records showed that no proceedings had been taken to segregate the alleged exclusive property of the oppositor-surviving spouse or to liquidate the conjugal partnership [6]. Until the conjugal partnership is liquidated or the ownership issue is adjudicated, the sale cannot be authorized over the vigorous opposition of the surviving spouse [6]. Furthermore, most items (furniture, books, appliances) could be easily preserved with proper storage, so there was no extreme urgency to sell them [6].

The lower court's order authorizing the sale is SET ASIDE [7].
