I. CAPTION
ARTHUR HENDERSON and MARIE B. HENDERSON v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE (and vice versa), G.R. Nos. L-12954 and L-13049, February 28, 1961.

II. FACTS
Arthur Henderson was the President of American International Underwriters for the Philippines, Inc. Between 1948 and 1952, he received allowances for house rental, utilities (light, water, telephone), and other residential expenses. He and his wife lived in spacious apartments chosen by his employer to entertain company officials and guests, a requirement of his high executive position. In 1952, his wife received a travel allowance to accompany him to New York. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) assessed deficiency income taxes, claiming these allowances were part of their taxable income. The Hendersons argued these were expenses for the "convenience of the employer" and that the wife's trip was to assist in business matters (building plans). The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruled that only the "ratable value" of the quarters (P4,800/year—the amount they would have personally spent for housing) was taxable, and the wife's travel allowance was not income. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the full amount of allowances for rental and utilities furnished by the employer constitutes taxable income.
2. W/N the wife's travel allowance constitutes taxable income.
3. W/N the "manager's residential expenses" in 1948 should be excluded from the taxable ratable value.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that only the **ratable value** of the quarters and utilities (fixed at P4,800 annually) constitutes taxable income under Section 29 of Commonwealth Act No. 466. The evidence showed the taxpayers were compelled by the employer to live in apartments that exceeded their personal needs to entertain guests and maintain social standing for the company. Consequently, the expenses incurred in excess of their personal needs redounded to the benefit of the employer, not the taxpayers.
2. **NO.** The wife's travel allowance was not income because the trip was undertaken at the behest of the husband's employer. She assisted in drawing plans for a proposed building and purchasing materials. No part of the allowance was retained by them or used for personal benefit.
3. **YES.** The "manager's residential expenses" of P3,249.32 in 1948 consisted of utility costs (light, water, telephone) incidental to the apartment. Since the apartment was furnished for the employer's convenience, these utility expenses—like the rental itself—should not form part of the taxable income beyond the established ratable value.

The judgment is MODIFIED. The Collector of Internal Revenue is ordered to refund the taxpayers the sum of P5,986.61.
