I. CAPTION
JOSE PANTOJA v. SATURNINO DAVID, as Collector of Internal Revenue, and the COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-10765, February 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 608, Bengzon, Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
On November 16, 1939, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed Pantoja P4,934.28 for taxes and surcharges on sales made from 1935 to 1938 [1]. Upon Pantoja's failure to pay, the Collector issued a warrant of distraint and levy on February 13, 1950—over 11 years after the assessment—resulting in the forfeiture of Pantoja’s real property in Cebu [1].

Pantoja filed a petition for prohibition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu, alleging prescription of the tax liability and lack of jurisdiction [1]. Following the organization of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in 1954, the case was transferred to the CTA [2]. The CTA dismissed the petition, ruling that: (1) it was effectively an injunction proceeding prohibited by the Revenue Code; and (2) Pantoja’s remedy was to pay the tax and sue for recovery [3]. Pantoja appealed to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Tax Appeals has the jurisdiction to annul a warrant of distraint and levy despite the prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to act on petitions for the annulment of distraint orders issued by the Collector of Internal Revenue [4]. The Supreme Court held that the CTA is the proper legal forum to discuss the validity of a distraint [4, 5].

Proceedings to invalidate a warrant of distraint and levy do not violate the statutory prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes because such proceedings are directed at the **right** of the Collector to collect the tax by distraint or levy [4, 6]. This is particularly true where, as in this case, the petitioner challenges the Collector's right to issue the warrant due to prescription [4]. The Court relied on *Collector of Internal Revenue v. Zulueta*, *Blaquera v. Rodriguez*, and *Collector v. Avelino* [4].

The CTA resolution dismissing Pantoja's petition is set aside [7].
