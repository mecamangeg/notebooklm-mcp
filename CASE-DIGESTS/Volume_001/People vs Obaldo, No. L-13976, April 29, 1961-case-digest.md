I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BERNARDO Z. OBALDO, G.R. No. L-13976, April 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On December 24, 1957, a duffel bag marked with the name of the accused, Bernardo Obaldo, was found floating near the Del Pan Bridge in Tondo. Inside was the dead body of Marcela Garcia. An autopsy revealed she had been sexually assaulted and died of asphyxiation. Obaldo executed an extra-judicial confession stating that after raping the victim, she became unconscious; not knowing what to do, he placed her inside the duffel bag and left it on a riverbank. The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted Obaldo of the complex crime of "rape with murder," attended by aggravating circumstances including cruelty and abuse of superior strength, and sentenced him to death. Obaldo appealed, challenging the validity of his confession and the court's jurisdiction over the rape charge.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the crimes of rape and murder were complex.
2. W/N the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the crime of rape.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the crimes of rape and murder were not the result of a single act but were committed separately [1, 2]. The evidence and confession showed that the victim was first raped and rendered unconscious. Her death by asphyxiation occurred later when she was placed in the bag and drowned or strangled [2]. Thus, they are separate offenses, not a complex crime.

2. **NO.** Because the crimes were committed separately, the specific requirement for the prosecution of rape under the law must be met. Under Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code, the complaint for rape must be signed by the parents, grandparents, or guardian of the deceased for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction [3, 4]. Since this requirement was not satisfied, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction to take cognizance of the rape case [5]. Consequently, the appellant cannot be convicted of rape [3]. He is convicted only of **murder**, attended by the aggravating circumstances of *despoblado* and abuse of superior strength [4, 6].

The judgment is MODIFIED. The accused is convicted of murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (due to lack of necessary votes for the death penalty), and the case for rape is DISMISSED [4, 7].
