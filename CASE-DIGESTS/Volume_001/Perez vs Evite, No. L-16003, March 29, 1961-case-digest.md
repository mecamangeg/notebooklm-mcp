I. CAPTION
CESAREO PEREZ and MAMERTA ALCANTARA v. VICENTE EVITE and SUSANA MANIGBAS, G.R. No. L-16003, March 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Spouses Perez and Alcantara filed an action to quiet title against Evite and Manigbas regarding a parcel of land in Batangas. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint and declared the defendants (Evite and Manigbas) the owners of the disputed property. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in *toto*. After the judgment became final, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for execution, and the Sheriff placed them in possession.

Plaintiffs moved to quash the writ of execution, arguing that since the decision merely declared the defendants as owners and did not explicitly order the delivery of possession, the writ was invalid. The trial court denied the motion and subsequently issued an order allowing the defendants to fence the property. Plaintiffs appealed, citing *Talens v. Garcia* and *Jabon v. Alo*, arguing that a declaration of ownership does not necessarily include a right to possession.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judgment declaring ownership includes the delivery of possession even if not explicitly stated in the dispositive portion.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Under Section 45 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a judgment is not confined to what appears upon the face of the decision, but also includes those things "actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto."

The Court distinguished this case from *Talens* and *Jabon*, noting that in those cases, the possessors might have held independent rights (such as tenancy) that had to be respected despite a change in ownership. Here, the plaintiffs' claim to possession was based solely on their claim of ownership, which had been rejected by the lower court. Since they offered no other valid reason to retain possession, the delivery of the land is deemed included in the judgment of ownership. To require a successful litigant to institute a separate action to obtain possession of land already adjudged to them would be a "cumbersome process" and result in a multiplicity of suits (*Marcelo v. Mencias*).

The orders appealed from are affirmed.
