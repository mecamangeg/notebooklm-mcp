I. CAPTION
PURA CARREON, ET AL. v. RUFO AGCAOILI and LOURDES SANTIAGO, G.R. No. L-11166, February 23, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The subject land was acquired during the marriage of Bonifacio Carreon and Celerina Dauag [1]. After Bonifacio's death, Celerina executed an affidavit on September 24, 1946, falsely adjudicating the land solely to herself as the only heiress [1]. A transfer certificate of title was issued in her name, annotated with the lien under Section 4, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court regarding the liability to excluded heirs for two years [1]. On October 13, 1947, Celerina sold the land to Rufo Agcaoili [2]. Agcaoili registered the sale, and a new title was issued to him carrying the same annotation [2, 3].

On February 19, 1955, the children of Celerina and Bonifacio filed a complaint against Agcaoili to recover their one-half share of the land [4]. They argued Agcaoili was a buyer in bad faith because, being a townmate of Celerina, he should have known she had children [5, 6]. Agcaoili was an enlisted man in the Philippine Constabulary who seldom visited his hometown [6]. The trial court ruled in favor of Agcaoili [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Agcaoili was a purchaser in good faith.
2. W/N the lien under Section 4, Rule 74 was still effective against Agcaoili when the complaint was filed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Fraud is not presumed and must be established by clear and sufficient evidence [6]. The mere fact that Agcaoili was a townmate of the vendor is insufficient to prove he knew of the children, particularly because he was an enlisted man who seldom went home [6]. Agcaoili relied on the Torrens title, which stated Celerina was the owner. A buyer is not required to do more than rely on the title and is only charged with notice of burdens noted on its face [7].

2. **NO.** The lien established in Section 4, Rule 74 is effective only for a period of two years [8]. In this case, more than two years had elapsed from the issuance of Celerina's title in 1946 to the registration of the sale to Agcaoili in 1949 [8]. Therefore, the lien had become *functus oficio* and could be cancelled, and Agcaoili held a valid title free from the trust claim of the heirs [8].

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED [9].
