I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BRAULIO BERSALONA and MARCELO VALLECERA, G.R. No. L-12236, April 28, 1961, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On March 28, 1955, in Mabini, Bohol, Francisco Bersalona was killed by his younger brother, appellant Braulio Bersalona, and Marcelo Vallecera. Francisco had previously executed a will instituting Braulio as his universal heir. Driven by greed to immediately possess the properties and perversity, Braulio conspired with Marcelo and Eleuterio Rajas (Braulio's son-in-law) to kill Francisco. Braulio promised to cancel Marcelo's P65.00 debt in exchange for his help.

While Francisco was paddling his boat alone at sea, the three accused intercepted him. Braulio jumped into Francisco’s boat, rode on his body, and choked him to death while Marcelo held Francisco's hands behind his back. They dumped the body into the sea to simulate drowning. Rajas was later discharged to become a state witness. The Court of First Instance of Bohol convicted Braulio and Marcelo of murder attended by five aggravating circumstances (evident premeditation, treachery, superior strength, disregard of age/relationship, and uninhabited place) and sentenced both to death.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the imposition of the death penalty upon both appellants is correct.

IV. RULING
**YES for Braulio Bersalona; NO for Marcelo Vallecera.**

The Court affirmed the conviction for murder, finding the testimony of state witness Rajas direct and coherent, corroborated by the motive regarding the will. The Court ruled that the aggravating circumstances of relationship and obvious ungratefulness can be appreciated only against the defendant to whom said circumstances are applicable [1].

For **Braulio**, his apparent perversity in killing his own brother to accelerate his inheritance, aggravated by relationship and ungratefulness, justifies the imposition of the **death penalty** [2, 3].

For **Marcelo**, the aggravating circumstances of relationship and ungratefulness do not apply to him. Consequently, there were insufficient votes to impose the supreme penalty. His sentence was reduced to ***reclusion perpetua*** [3].

Judgment modified.
