I. CAPTION
CONSTANCIO SIENES, ET AL. v. FIDEL ESPARCIA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12957, March 24, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Lot 3368 originally belonged to Saturnino Yaeso. Upon his death, the lot was inherited by Francisco Yaeso, his son with his second wife, Andrea Gutang. Francisco died single and without descendants in 1932, so his mother Andrea inherited the property as his sole heir.

On April 20, 1951, Andrea sold the property to petitioners (spouses Sienes). Subsequently, on July 30, 1951, Paulina and Cipriana Yaeso (Francisco's half-sisters from Saturnino's first marriage) executed a deed of sale for the same property in favor of respondents (spouses Esparcia).

Andrea died on December 13, 1951. Cipriana, the lone surviving reservee, died shortly after on January 13, 1952. The trial court declared both sales void: the sale by Andrea because the property passed to the reservee upon her death, and the sale by Cipriana because she was not yet the owner at the time of sale. The court ordered the property reverted to the Estate of Cipriana Yaeso. Petitioners Sienes appealed, but respondents Esparcia did not.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the property is subject to *reserva troncal*.
2. W/N the sale by the reservor (Andrea) to petitioners is valid.
3. W/N the sale by the reservee (Cipriana) to respondents is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The property was inherited by Francisco from his father by gratuitous title and subsequently inherited by his mother (Andrea) by operation of law. Andrea was obliged to reserve it for the benefit of relatives within the third degree belonging to the line from which the property came [1]. Cipriana, a half-sister, was a qualified reservee.

2. **NO.** The reservor holds legal title subject to a resolutory condition: that the reservee survives the reservor. While the reservor may alienate the property, the transferee's rights are revoked if the reservee survives the reservor [2]. Since Cipriana (reservee) survived Andrea (reservor), the sale to petitioners was extinguished and the property passed in exclusive ownership to Cipriana [3].

3. **YES (in principle), but relief is barred by lack of appeal.** The *reserva* creates a real right in favor of the reservee which is alienable, subject to the condition that the reservee survives the reservor. Since Cipriana survived Andrea, she became the absolute owner, and her prior sale to respondents became effective [4]. However, since respondents Esparcia **did not appeal** the trial court's decision declaring their sale void, the Supreme Court could not reverse that portion of the judgment. The order reverting the property to the Estate of Cipriana Yaeso was affirmed, without prejudice to a separate action by respondents against the Estate [4, 5].

**Disposition:** Decision modified.
