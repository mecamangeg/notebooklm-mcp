I. CAPTION
MANUEL M. ANTONIO v. MAURO SAMONTE, ET AL. and THE NATIONAL WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY (NAWASA), G.R. No. L-15410, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellant Manuel Antonio obtained a judgment for a sum of money against the spouses Mauro and Mely Samonte in the Municipal Court of Manila. After the writ of execution was returned unsatisfied, the Sheriff garnished Samonte's credits held by NAWASA. Despite the garnishment, NAWASA paid Samonte P6,527.33. Upon examination, it was found that NAWASA still held P1,377.00 due to Samonte. The Municipal Court ordered NAWASA to pay Antonio P992.25 on April 10, 1958.

However, NAWASA petitioned to set aside this order, alleging it discovered prior claims for unpaid wages amounting to P3,853.50 against Samonte's credits. On May 10, 1958, the Municipal Court granted NAWASA's petition and ordered the payment to Antonio to "be withheld for the time being" until the rights of prior claimants were satisfied. Antonio appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI), which dismissed the appeal on the ground that the May 10 order was interlocutory and unappealable.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Municipal Court's order dated May 10, 1958 is a final and appealable order.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order is final and appealable. A final order is one that disposes of or determines the rights of parties, leaving no issue for future consideration except compliance [1, 2]. Although the order purported to withhold payment only "for the time being," its net effect was to adjudicate substantial rights regarding the priority of liens, authorizing the satisfaction of other claims ahead of the appellant's judgment credit [3]. Since the other claims exceeded the remaining credit, the order effectively destroyed the priority of the appellant's garnishment and left the satisfaction of his judgment dependent on a non-existent balance [4].

The Court cited *Caudill Coal Co. v. Rosenheim & Co.*, ruling that orders definitely determining the priority of claims and directing distribution are final for the purpose of an appeal [5]. The order left nothing further for the Municipal Court to do regarding the satisfaction of the alleged prior claims.

The order appealed from is **REVERSED**, and the case is remanded to the lower court to give due course to the appeal.
