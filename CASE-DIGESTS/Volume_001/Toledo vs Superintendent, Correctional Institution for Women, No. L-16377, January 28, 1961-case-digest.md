I. CAPTION
PURA TOLEDO v. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN, G.R. No. L-16377, January 28, 1961, Bengzon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pura Toledo was sentenced in nine separate criminal cases to a total imprisonment of 10 years, 11 months, and 5 days, plus the payment of indemnities. If the indemnities were not paid, the subsidiary imprisonment would amount to 3 years and 7 months. Although Toledo had already served the principal penalty (adjusted for good conduct), the respondent Superintendent detained her to serve the subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of indemnities [1].

Toledo challenged this detention in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, arguing that under Article 39 of the Revised Penal Code, she was not required to suffer subsidiary imprisonment because her principal penalty exceeded *prision correccional* (6 years) [2]. The trial court ruled in favor of Toledo [2]. The Superintendent appealed, arguing that Article 39 did not apply because none of Toledo's nine individual convictions exceeded *prision correccional* [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a prisoner is liable for subsidiary imprisonment for non-payment of indemnities when the aggregate principal penalty exceeds 6 years, even if the individual penalties do not.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that Toledo is not obligated to serve subsidiary imprisonment [3].

The Court applied Article 39 of the Revised Penal Code, which states that "when the principal penalty imposed is higher than *prision correccional*, no subsidiary imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit" [2]. The Court reasoned that the aggregate penalties should be considered in bulk, not separately [3]. The theory of the law is that no prisoner should be held in jail for more than six years merely by reason of insolvency [3].

Citing *Bagtas v. Director of Prisons*, the Court reiterated the rule: "multiply the highest principal penalty by 3 and the result will be the aggregate principal penalty... plus the payment of all the indemnities... with or without subsidiary imprisonment depending upon whether or not the principal penalty exceeds 6 years" [4]. Since Toledo's aggregate principal penalty exceeded 6 years, she is exempt from subsidiary imprisonment [4].

The petition was granted, and the judgment of the lower court was affirmed [5].
