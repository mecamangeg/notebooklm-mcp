I. CAPTION
NATIONAL FASTENER CORPORATION OF THE PHILIPPINES v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and NATIONAL FASTENER EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION (PTUC), G.R. No. L-15834, January 20, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner National Fastener Corporation dismissed Celestino Blas, a union sergeant-at-arms, on July 17, 1958. The Respondent Union filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP), alleging Blas was dismissed to discourage union membership and in retaliation for testifying against the corporation in a previous ULP case (Case No. 1340-ULP). The Petitioner denied the charge, claiming Blas was dismissed for absenteeism, specifically for being absent without authority from July 7 to 19, 1958. Blas testified he had secured permission for leave from the company president.

The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) trial judge found the Petitioner guilty of ULP and ordered Blas's reinstatement without backpay. Upon a motion for reconsideration, the CIR *en banc* modified the ruling, ordering reinstatement *with* backwages. Petitioner appealed, arguing the dismissal was justified and the award of backpay was an abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Petitioner is guilty of Unfair Labor Practice for dismissing Blas.
2. W/N the CIR abused its discretion in awarding backwages.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed the CIR's finding of Unfair Labor Practice. Substantial evidence presented showed that the Petitioner’s superintendent, Santiago Elizaga, had previously warned Blas against union affiliation, promised him a raise to desist, and threatened him after he testified in a prior case. Elizaga admitted that other employees with unexcused absences were not dismissed, indicating discrimination. Additionally, Elizaga's report to management specifically noted Blas's union membership. Under Section 6 of Republic Act No. 875, the factual findings of the CIR are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence; the issue in such reviews is the credibility of evidence relied upon, not the preponderance thereof [1], [2].

2. **NO.** The award of backpay to an illegally dismissed employee rests within the sound discretion of the Industrial Court under Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 875 and established jurisprudence (*Velez v. PAV Watchman's Union*). The Court found no abuse of this discretion [2].

The resolution appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
