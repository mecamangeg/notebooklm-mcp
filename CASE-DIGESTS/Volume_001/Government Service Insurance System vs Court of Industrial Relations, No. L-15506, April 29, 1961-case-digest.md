I. CAPTION
GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and JUAN BAUTISTA FRASCO, G.R. No. L-15506, April 29, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Juan Bautista Frasco, a GSIS clerk, was originally dismissed in 1952 but was reinstated following a recommendation from the Office of the Economic Coordinator. This reinstatement rendered a pending Union demand regarding his case in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) academic. Previously, in the related labor case (CIR Case No. 896-V), the CIR issued an order on June 17, 1953, prohibiting dismissal or suspension of employees without court consent.

On March 18, 1954, Frasco was promoted but felt insulted by the salary. He returned the appointment paper with an insulting note written on it. Consequently, the GSIS General Manager suspended him, and the Board of Trustees (BOT) eventually dismissed him for the second time. Instead of appealing to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, Frasco appealed directly to the Office of the President (OP). The OP concurred with the guilt but modified the penalty to resignation. While his motion for reconsideration was pending with the OP, Frasco filed a petition with the CIR in 1957, invoking the June 17, 1953 order to seek reinstatement. The CIR ruled in favor of Frasco. GSIS appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Frasco can validly invoke the jurisdiction of the CIR to order his reinstatement despite his pending appeal with the Office of the President.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the CIR decision. The Court held that Frasco is **estopped** from questioning the jurisdiction of the Office of the President or invoking the CIR's authority. Having freely chosen to appeal to the OP, he submitted to its authority and cannot be permitted to question it later to escape a penalty. The Court cited *Littleton vs. Burgess*, stating: "It is not the privilege of a party who, to accomplish his purpose, has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court or agency over a particular matter to afterwards deny such jurisdiction to escape penalty."

The Court also affirmed that the direct appeal to the President was proper, citing *Negado vs. Ruiz Castro*, because the President may *motu proprio* revise decisions of the Civil Service Board of Appeals. Furthermore, the CIR lacked authority because the 1953 order was no longer applicable to Frasco, as the specific labor dispute concerning him had become academic upon his first reinstatement.

The decision of the CIR is SET ASIDE, without prejudice to Frasco prosecuting his appeal pending in the Office of the President.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Concepcion, J.**, concurs in the result.
