I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FEDERICO DESPAVELLADOR Y DULOT, G.R. No. L-13814, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 27, 1955, Federico Despavellador, driving a passenger bus, sideswiped a passenger jeepney driven by Jose Perez and owned by Librada Manalo on Azcarraga St., Manila [1]. The Information charged Despavellador with damage to property through reckless negligence, specifically alleging damages to the *jeepney* in the amount of P200.00 [1].

The Court of First Instance (CFI) initially convicted him, ordering indemnification for the jeepney (P100) and for the fish cargo of a passenger, Flaviana Enriquez (P85) [2]. The Court of Appeals set aside this decision and remanded the case solely to determine the specific amount of damage to the jeepney, which is essential for fixing the penalty under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code [3]. Upon remand, the prosecution failed to present evidence regarding the jeepney's damage. Consequently, the CFI rendered a second decision convicting Despavellador of damage to property through reckless imprudence regarding the *wares* (fish) of passenger Enriquez, valued at P85.00 [4]. Despavellador appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing he was convicted of a crime not charged in the Information [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused can be convicted of damage to the passenger's wares when the Information charged damage to the jeepney.
2. W/N the accused can be penalized for damage to the jeepney despite the lack of evidence regarding the specific amount of damage.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Information charged the accused with damage to the *jeep* belonging to Librada Manalo, not the *wares* of passenger Flaviana Enriquez [5]. The crime of damage to the wares was not charged in the Information, nor does it include or is included in the facts alleged therein [5]. A judgment punishing an accused for an offense of which he was not legally informed denies him due process of law [6, 7].

2. **YES.** The failure to establish the specific value of the damage to the jeep is not an insurmountable obstacle to imposing a penalty [7]. Under the third paragraph of Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code, if the reckless act results in damage to property, the fine shall be equal to the value of the damage but "in no case be less than twenty-five pesos" [7]. Following *People v. Rodriguez* and *People v. Narvas*, where there is no evidence as to the amount of damage, the damage should be deemed to be at least P25.00 [8, 9].

**ACCORDINGLY**, the judgment is **MODIFIED**. Appellant is convicted of the offense of damage to the jeep of Librada Manalo through reckless negligence and sentenced to pay a fine of P25.00 and indemnify Librada Manalo in the sum of P25.00 [9].
