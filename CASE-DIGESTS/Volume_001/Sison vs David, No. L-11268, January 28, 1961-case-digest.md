I. CAPTION
CARLOS M. SISON v. GONZALO D. DAVID, G.R. No. L-11268, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Defendant Gonzalo D. David was the counsel for the executor of the estate of Margarita David. The estate owed him fees, which were annotated as an adverse claim on titles of properties inherited by Priscila Sison, wife of plaintiff Carlos M. Sison [1-3]. These properties were transferred to Priscila Estate, Inc., a corporation presided over by Carlos. When the corporation sought to lift the adverse claim to sell a property, Gonzalo filed a "Petition for Bond" opposing the sale [3, 4].

In said petition, Gonzalo alleged that Priscila’s paraphernal properties were being sold to pay for overdrafts caused by improvements on the couple’s conjugal properties, implying Carlos was enriching himself at his wife's expense and defeating the testatrix's wishes [4-6]. Carlos filed a suit for damages, claiming these statements were malicious, irrelevant, and libelous [6]. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Carlos, awarding him damages on the ground that the statements were only qualifiedly privileged and made with malice [1, 7]. Gonzalo appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the allegations made by the defendant in his "Petition for Bond" constitute an absolutely privileged communication.
2. W/N the plaintiff is liable for attorney's fees for filing the suit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court held that utterances made in the course of judicial proceedings, including all kinds of pleadings, petitions, and motions, belong to the class of communications that are **absolutely privileged** [8-10]. No action for libel or slander may be founded thereon when **pertinent and relevant** to the subject under inquiry, however false and malicious such statements may be [8, 10].

The privilege is absolute, not qualified; hence, it is not conditioned on the absence of express malice [11, 12]. The only requirement is relevancy. Here, Gonzalo's allegations regarding the dissipation of the estate's assets were pertinent to his prayer to disapprove the sale or require a bond to secure his claim for fees [13, 14]. Since the statements were relevant to the relief sought, they are absolutely privileged and bar any civil action for libel [13].

2. **YES.** The Court found that the plaintiff, being a lawyer, must have known that the "Petition for Bond" was absolutely privileged and that the facts stated therein were true [15]. The record indicated the complaint was unfounded and filed for the purpose of harassment. Consequently, the plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendant a reasonable amount for attorney's fees and litigation expenses pursuant to Article 2208(4) of the Civil Code [16].

**Decision reversed.** The complaint is dismissed, and plaintiff is ordered to pay defendant P3,000.00 as attorney's fees [17].
