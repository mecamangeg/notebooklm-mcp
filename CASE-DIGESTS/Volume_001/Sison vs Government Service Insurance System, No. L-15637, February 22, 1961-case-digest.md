I. CAPTION
TEOFILO SISON v. GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, G.R. No. L-15637, February 22, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Teofilo Sison had a long career in government service starting in 1901. He was appointed Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals on February 1, 1936, and served until October 31, 1939, covering a period of 3 years, 8 months, and 24 days [1]. He resigned from the judiciary at age 59 to accept an appointment as Secretary of National Defense [1, 2]. He eventually retired on June 16, 1952, at age 72, with a total of over 41 years of government service [1].

Sison was retired under Republic Act (RA) No. 660 but claimed entitlement to the higher benefits under RA 910, as amended by RA 1057 [2]. RA 1057 extended RA 910 benefits to Justices who ceased holding their positions to accept other government posts [2]. The GSIS denied his claim because, although he had over 20 years of total government service, he lacked the "ten years continuous service in the judiciary" required by RA 910 [2]. Sison filed a complaint, which the Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissed [1]. Sison appealed, arguing that the 10-year judiciary service requirement should not apply to those who left to accept other government offices [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a Justice who resigned to accept another government position is entitled to retirement benefits under RA 910 as amended, despite having rendered less than ten years of continuous service in the judiciary.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that Sison is not entitled to the benefits under RA 910.

RA 910 allows for optional retirement at age 57 provided the retiree has rendered at least 20 years of government service, "10 or more of which must have been continuously rendered as such Justice or as Judge of a court of record" [4]. While RA 1057 extended these benefits to Justices who left the judiciary to accept other government positions, Section 2-A of the amendatory act expressly contained a proviso: "That at the time of his cessation in office... he possessed **all the requirements prescribed by this Act**" [5].

The Court ruled that RA 1057 did not remove the prerequisite conditions of RA 910; it merely extended its application [5, 6]. Consequently, a Justice who ceases to hold office to accept another position must still possess the service record of 20 years, ten (10) of them continuously in the judiciary, at the time of cessation [3]. Since Sison only served in the Court of Appeals for less than 4 years, he failed to meet the statutory requirement [7].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [8].
