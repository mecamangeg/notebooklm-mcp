I. CAPTION
In the Matter of the Petition of Ong Ching Guan to be Admitted a Citizen of the Philippines. Ong Ching Guan v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-15691, March 27, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On September 11, 1954, Ong Ching Guan filed a petition for naturalization with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [1]. He promised that although his children were not yet of school age, he would enroll them in government-recognized schools teaching Philippine history and civics [1]. The CFI granted his petition on September 29, 1956 [1]. Two years later, on September 24, 1958, Ong filed a petition to take the oath of allegiance [2]. However, the CFI denied this petition because evidence revealed that one of his children, Johnny Ong, had finished Grade I at St. Stephen's High School, an exclusive school for Chinese students, before being transferred to St. Mary's Academy [3]. The CFI held that this failed to establish that he would not transfer them back to a Chinese school [2]. Ong appealed the denial [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner is disqualified from taking the oath of allegiance due to enrolling his children in an exclusive Chinese school.

IV. RULING
**YES.** (The Court ruled he is disqualified). The Supreme Court held that under Republic Act No. 530, a decision granting naturalization does not become executory until after two years and a subsequent hearing where the applicant's qualifications may still be scrutinized [5]. The Court found that St. Stephen's High School is an exclusive school for Chinese nationals, limited only to Chinese students and children of the school's teachers [3].

The petitioner's act of enrolling his children in an exclusive Chinese school, despite the lower court's injunction to enroll them in a government-recognized school, evinced a desire to segregate his children from Filipino schoolchildren [3]. This violated the essential requisite for naturalization requiring an actual desire and overt acts to mingle and associate with Filipinos to permit gradual assimilation [3]. Since the petitioner failed to prove his intention to assimilate himself and his children into Philippine citizenry, he did not possess the requisite qualifications [6].

The decision admitting the petitioner for naturalization was **SET ASIDE** and the petition was **DISMISSED** [6].
