I. CAPTION
**SANDRA K. SHAOUY v. PHILIP E. SHAOUY**, G.R. No. L-14517, February 27, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Sandra K. Shaouy filed a complaint against her husband, defendant Philip E. Shaouy, seeking P120,000.00 in moral damages, P30,000.00 in exemplary damages, and P10,000.00 in attorney's fees [1]. In response, Philip set up a counterclaim for P50,000.00 in actual, moral, and punitive damages, plus P10,000.00 in attorney's fees [2]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed both the complaint and the counterclaim [2].

Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals. However, the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court because the claim of each party exceeded P50,000.00 [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for determination.

Under Section 31 of Republic Act No. 296, as amended by Republic Act No. 2613, the Court of Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction where the amount involved does not exceed P200,000.00 and factual issues are raised [3, 4]. While the Court of Appeals certified the case because the claims exceeded P50,000.00, the aggregate sum claimed by each party (P160,000.00 for the plaintiff and P60,000.00 for the defendant) falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under the amended law [4].

Accordingly, the record of the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals [4].
