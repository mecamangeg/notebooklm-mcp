I. CAPTION
M. MCCONNEL, W. P. COCHRANE, RICARDO RODRIGUEZ, ET AL. v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and DOMINGA DE LOS REYES, assisted by her husband, SABINO PADILLA, G.R. No. L-10510, March 17, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L.

II. FACTS
Park Rite Co., Inc. (the Corporation) operated a parking business and occupied a lot owned by respondents Dominga de los Reyes and Sabino Padilla without their knowledge or consent [1]. Upon discovery, respondents demanded payment and subsequently filed a forcible entry case in the Municipal Court, which ordered the Corporation to pay P11,732.50 [2]. The judgment remained unsatisfied because the Corporation had no assets other than P550 deposited in court [2]. Respondents then filed a suit in the Court of First Instance (CFI) against the Corporation and its stockholders (including petitioners) to hold them jointly and severally liable [3]. The CFI denied recovery, but the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed this decision, finding that the Corporation was a mere *alter ego* of its principal stockholders—who kept corporate funds in their own names and left the entity with no visible assets—and held them liable [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the individual stockholders may be held liable for the obligations contracted by the Corporation.
2. W/N the CFI had jurisdiction over the suit to hold the stockholders liable.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court affirmed that the stockholders are liable. The Court of Appeals correctly found that the Corporation was a mere *alter ego* or business conduit of the stockholders, who completely dominated and controlled it for their sole benefit [6]. Evidence showed the Corporation had no visible assets and its funds were kept in the personal name of stockholder Cirilo Paredes [4]. The Court applied the established principle that the corporate veil may be pierced when the entity is used as a business conduit for the sole benefit of stockholders, or to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, citing *Koppel (Phil.) Inc. v. Yatco* and *Arnold v. Willits and Patterson* [4, 7].

2. **YES.** The Court rejected the argument that the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the judgment should have been enforced by motion within five years [8]. The Supreme Court ruled that the instant suit was not an action to enforce the Municipal Court judgment against the original debtor, but rather an action to have non-parties to that judgment (the stockholders) held responsible for its payment [8].

Petition denied; judgment affirmed [9].
