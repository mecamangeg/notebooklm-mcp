I. CAPTION
MAXIMO VERGARA, GAVINO AGUILAR and MAMERTO PORTEZO v. GETULIO BRUCELA, JUSTO V. IMPERIAL, SEGISMUNDO GARZA, JOSE GARZA and VICENTE GARZA, G.R. No. L-12961, February 23, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Vergara, Aguilar, and Portezo were the defendants in prior civil cases regarding land recovery filed by the Garzas. After judgment was rendered against them for the restitution of the land, the trial court issued an order on September 21, 1956, directing the Sheriff to demolish the plaintiffs' houses on the property [1]. A motion for reconsideration was denied on September 29, 1956, and the Sheriffs demolished the houses on October 13, 1956 [1]. Plaintiffs subsequently filed an action for damages against the Sheriffs and the Garzas, alleging that the demolition was illegal because the order had not yet become final [2]. The lower court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages against the defendants for the demolition of their houses.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, ruling that the Sheriffs merely acted in compliance with a judicial command [4]. The Court noted that the order specifically directed the "immediate" demolition of the houses [4]. Since the plaintiffs admitted the peremptory tenor of the order and did not question its validity, no cause of action could possibly arise against the sheriffs or the other defendants for acts performed in obedience to a valid court order [4, 5]. The order appealed from is affirmed [6].
