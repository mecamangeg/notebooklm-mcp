**I. CAPTION**
**EDUARDO GOSIENGFIAO v. HONORABLE NICASIO YATCO, JESUS V. MERRITT and THE SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY**, G.R. No. L-16676, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

**II. FACTS**
In Civil Case No. 2552, the respondent Judge Nicasio Yatco approved petitioner Eduardo Gosiengfiao's record on appeal on October 19, 1959 [1]. However, on November 2, 1959—thirteen days after said approval—Judge Yatco issued an order *motu proprio* requiring Gosiengfiao to amend the record on appeal by deleting certain pleadings the court deemed irrelevant [2, 3]. Gosiengfiao moved for reconsideration on jurisdictional grounds, but the motion was denied [3]. Subsequently, on February 23, 1960, the trial court issued a writ of execution for the judgment [1]. Gosiengfiao filed a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction, arguing the lower court had lost jurisdiction [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to order the amendment of the record on appeal thirteen days after its approval.
2. W/N the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a writ of execution after the appeal had been perfected.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that while a trial court has general power to make orders conform to law, there is a limit to the period within which a record on appeal may be amended [1]. Under **Section 11, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court**, the clerk must transmit the record on appeal to the appellate court within ten days of its approval [1]. Furthermore, **Section 9, Rule 41** provides that the trial court loses jurisdiction over the case upon the approval of the record on appeal [1]. Therefore, after the expiration of the ten-day period following the approval of the record on appeal, the lower court lost the power to order its amendment, especially over the opposition of the appellant [1].

2. **NO.** Once the appeal is perfected and the record on appeal is approved, the lower court loses the power to issue any order regarding the matter in dispute or the property involved, except for the preservation of the latter, pursuant to **Section 9, Rule 41** [4]. Consequently, the order for execution was issued unlawfully [4]. Since the order requiring the amendment was void for lack of jurisdiction, the petitioner cannot be punished for contempt for refusing to comply with it [4].

The petition is **GRANTED**, the orders are set aside, and the writ of preliminary injunction is made permanent [5].
