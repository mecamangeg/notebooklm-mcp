I. CAPTION
MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. CITY OF DAGUPAN, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16596, April 26, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Manila Railroad Company (petitioner) owned several parcels of land (Cadastral Lots Nos. 8942, 8713, 3212, 358, 357, 4193, 6369, and 6444) in Dagupan City which it leased to private individuals [1]. The City of Dagupan (respondent) assessed real estate taxes on these properties, which petitioner paid in the amount of P87.60 under protest [1]. Petitioner filed a complaint for refund in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, arguing that under Section 12 of its charter, Act No. 1510, it is exempt from all taxes on property "owned or operated by the grantee under this concession or franchise" [1-3]. The trial court dismissed the complaint [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court on a pure question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the subject lots owned by petitioner but leased to private individuals are exempt from real estate taxes under Act No. 1510 [1].

IV. RULING
**NO**. The Supreme Court held that the tax exemption provided in Act No. 1510 is not absolute [3]. The charter provision states that the annual payments to the government are in lieu of taxes on property "owned or operated by the grantee under this concession or franchise" [3]. The Court reasoned that the phrase "under this concession or franchise" qualifies the terms "owned" and "operated," limiting the exemption only to properties held for the proper accomplishment of the corporation's stated purpose, which is to locate, construct, and operate railways [3, 4].

Since the lots in question were rented to private individuals and not used for the authorized business of the railroad, they are not exempt from taxation [5, 6]. The Court cited general American law, which holds that railroad tax exemptions do not include structures or lands leased to private parties for purposes foreign to the railroad's operation [7]. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed [8].
