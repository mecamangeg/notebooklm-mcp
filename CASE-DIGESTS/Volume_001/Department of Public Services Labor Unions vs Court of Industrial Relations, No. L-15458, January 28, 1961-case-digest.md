I. CAPTION
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES LABOR UNIONS v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, HON. ARSENIO H. LACSON and THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF THE CITY OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-15458, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
The petitioner, Department of Public Services Labor Unions, composed of employees of the City of Manila's Department of Public Services (DPS), filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) against the City Mayor and Municipal Board. The Union sought the enforcement of Republic Act No. 1880, which prescribed a 40-hour work week (Monday to Friday), and demanded overtime compensation for work rendered on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The respondents moved to dismiss the case on the ground that the CIR lacked jurisdiction. The CIR dismissed the petition, and the Union appealed to the Supreme Court. The DPS is responsible for the collection and disposal of garbage and public sanitation [1-3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the case involving the City of Manila's Department of Public Services.
2. W/N the 40-hour work week under RA 1880 applies to DPS employees.
3. W/N DPS employees are entitled to overtime compensation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The City of Manila, through the DPS, performs governmental functions (conserving public health through garbage disposal) rather than proprietary functions for profit. In the performance of governmental functions, the City acts as an agent of the State and enjoys immunity from suit unless consent is expressly given. Since no consent was shown, the CIR lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case [4].

2. **NO.** RA 1880 and Executive Order No. 251 allow for exceptions when the "exigencies of the service so require." The Mayor has the discretion to extend work schedules beyond the 40-hour limit to ensure the continuous collection of garbage. Restricting work to 5 days would undermine public health and sanitation due to the accumulation of refuse and foul odors [5, 6].

3. **NO.** Under Section 259 of the Revised Administrative Code, government employees with fixed salaries appointed under Civil Service Law are not entitled to overtime compensation in the absence of a special provision. The Eight-Hour Labor Law applies only to employment in industry or occupations for profit or gain, not to governmental functions like those of the DPS [7, 8].

The order of dismissal is **AFFIRMED** [9].
