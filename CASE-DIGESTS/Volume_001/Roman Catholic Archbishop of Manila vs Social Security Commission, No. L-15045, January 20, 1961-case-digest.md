I. CAPTION
ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF MANILA v. SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-15045, January 20, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1958, petitioner Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila filed a request with respondent Social Security Commission (SSC) to exempt "Catholic Charities" and all religious and charitable institutions operated by it from the compulsory coverage of Republic Act No. 1161 (Social Security Law) [1]. Petitioner argued that the law is a labor law intended only for businesses and activities organized for profit [1]. The SSC denied the request in Resolution No. 572 and subsequently denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration in Resolution No. 767 [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court pursuant to Section 5(c) of R.A. 1161 [1].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N religious and charitable institutions not organized for profit are included in the coverage of the Social Security Law.
2. W/N the inclusion of religious organizations violates the constitutional prohibition against the application of public funds for the benefit of any priest.
3. W/N the inclusion impairs the right to disseminate religious information.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Social Security Law covers all employment not expressly excluded, predicated on the existence of an employer-employee relationship [2]. The statutory definition of "employer" covers "activity of any kind" and is sufficiently comprehensive to include religious and charitable institutions [3, 4]. The rule of *ejusdem generis* does not apply to limit the law to profit-making entities because the legislature clearly intended inclusion; this is evidenced by the enactment of R.A. 1792, which expressly deleted the previous exemption for religious and charitable institutions [5]. Furthermore, the Social Security Law is a social legislation enacted under the police power to promote social justice, unlike the Industrial Peace Act which is limited to industrial/commercial enterprises [6, 7].

2. **NO.** The funds contributed to the Social Security System are not public funds but are funds belonging to the members held in trust by the Government [8]. Even assuming they possessed a public character, the payment of benefits to a priest would not violate the Constitution because such payment is made to him in his capacity as an employee, not as a priest [8].

3. **NO.** The inclusion of religious organizations does not impair their right to disseminate religious information [9]. The monthly contributions are intended for the protection of employees against the hazards of disability, sickness, old age, and death, consistent with the State's duty to promote social justice [9].

Resolutions affirmed [10].
