I. CAPTION
IN RE: PETITION TO BE ADMITTED CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. GERVACIO CABRALES CU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-16073, March 27, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gervacio Cabrales Cu, a citizen of the Chinese Republic born in Ilocos Norte, filed a second petition for naturalization on April 22, 1958, after his first petition was denied by the Supreme Court in 1955 without prejudice. He is a merchant with an annual income of P900.00, supporting a wife and seven children.

The trial court denied his second petition because he failed to register as an alien under the Alien Registration Act of 1950. Petitioner admitted this failure but claimed he did not register because he honestly believed he was a Filipino. However, records showed that in 1947, his certificate of candidacy for municipal councilor was cancelled because he was found to be a Chinese citizen. He only registered as an alien on December 9, 1958, one day before the scheduled hearing of his second petition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner’s failure to register as an alien disqualifies him from naturalization.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Naturalization Law requires an applicant to conduct himself in a proper and irreproachable manner during his entire period of residence in the Philippines. The Court found that the petitioner willfully violated the Alien Registration Act of 1950. His defense of believing himself to be Filipino was untenable because his 1947 candidacy was cancelled on the ground of his Chinese citizenship, and the Supreme Court had previously denied his first petition for naturalization. These events served as sufficient warning to register, yet he stubbornly disobeyed the law until the last minute.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that an annual income of P900.00, with a wife and seven children to support (four of whom were in school), is clearly not a lucrative lawful occupation. Citing *Almonte Uy v. Republic* and *Swee Din Tan v. Republic*, the Court noted that admitting such a petitioner would only add to the problems confronting the nation.

The decision of the trial court denying the petition is AFFIRMED.
