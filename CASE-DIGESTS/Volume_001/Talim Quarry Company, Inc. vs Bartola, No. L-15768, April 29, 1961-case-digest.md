I. CAPTION
TALIM QUARRY COMPANY, INC. and TALIM QUARRY LABOR UNION v. GAVINO BARTOLA, et al. and the COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-15768, April 29, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Talim Quarry Company’s employees belonged to two unions: the Talim Quarry Labor Union (TQLU) and Ang Gabay ng Subay. After TQLU won a certification election in 1955, it executed a collective bargaining agreement with the company on April 24, 1956 to end a strike. The agreement contained a "union shop" clause requiring all current employees not yet members of TQLU to join within 30 days as a condition for continued employment [1, 2].

Respondents Gavino Bartola and 12 other employees, who were members of Ang Gabay ng Subay and already employed by the company prior to the agreement, refused to join TQLU. Upon TQLU's demand, the company dismissed them on July 9, 1956. The dismissed employees filed a complaint for unfair labor practice. The Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) *en banc* ruled in their favor and ordered their reinstatement, reversing the trial judge's earlier dismissal of the complaint [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the union-shop agreement applies to employees already employed and belonging to another union at the time of its execution, rendering their dismissal valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR *en banc* resolution, ruling that the dismissal was illegal. The Court held that a closed-shop or union-shop clause in a collective bargaining agreement does not apply to persons belonging to another labor union who were already hired at the time the agreement was executed; it is effective only upon those yet to be hired [4].

Citing *Freeman Shirt Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations* (G.R. No. L-16561), the Court reiterated that the dismissal of old employees for refusing to comply with a closed-shop contract is unlawful [4]. The resolution of the CIR is affirmed [5].
