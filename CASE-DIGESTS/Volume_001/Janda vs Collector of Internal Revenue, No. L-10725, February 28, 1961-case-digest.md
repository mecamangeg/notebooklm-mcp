I. CAPTION
ROBERT L. JANDA v. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-10725, February 28, 1961, Bengzon, Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Janda contested an income tax assessment for 1950. After an initial denial, he received a revised assessment reducing his liability on October 14, 1954. His counsel subsequently requested 30 days to contact Janda, who was in the United States, before taking the matter up. The Respondent Collector treated this as a request for an extension of time to pay and granted it. Janda later paid a portion of the tax but requested reconsideration for the balance. On February 2, 1955, Janda received a letter from the Respondent dated January 14, 1955, demanding payment of the balance and stating that no further reduction would be made; this letter was understood by both parties to be the "final decision." Janda filed a petition for review with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) on February 23, 1955. The CTA dismissed the appeal as time-barred, ruling that the 30-day appeal period commenced upon receipt of the revised assessment on October 14, 1954, and had expired.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for review was filed within the 30-day prescriptive period.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the appeal was timely filed. The thirty-day period within which to appeal to the CTA should be counted from the date of receipt by the taxpayer of the final decision regarding their liability. While the CTA strictly interpreted the procedural timeline starting from the first revised assessment, the Supreme Court ruled that the Collector's letter of January 14, 1955—which categorically stated that no further reduction would be made—constituted the final appealable decision. The Court relied on *St. Stephen Asso. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, establishing that the Collector may validly elect to treat his last letter as the final decision. Since Janda received this final decision on February 2, 1955, and filed his petition on February 23, 1955, the action was well within the statutory period.

The Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals was revoked and the case was remanded for further proceedings.
