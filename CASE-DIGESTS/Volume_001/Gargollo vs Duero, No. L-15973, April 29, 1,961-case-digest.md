**I. CAPTION**
PERPETUA GARGOLLO v. ALFREDO DUERO and JOSEFINA ESPEJO, G.R. No. L-15973, April 29, 1961, Barrera, J.

**II. FACTS**
On May 20, 1953, Petitioner Gargollo sold a parcel of land (Lot No. 3016) with *pacto de retro* to Respondents Duero and Espejo for P750.00, redeemable on or before 1962 [1]. During their possession, the Respondents introduced useful improvements, including fruit trees and rice paddies [1]. When Gargollo sought to redeem the property, the Respondents refused to vacate unless reimbursed for the value of these improvements [1, 2]. The parties could not agree on the value [3]. Consequently, Gargollo manifested to the court that she opted *not* to pay for the improvements, invoking Article 547 of the Civil Code, which allows a land owner to require a possessor in good faith to remove improvements if the owner chooses not to pay for them [4]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo ruled in favor of Gargollo, ordering the Respondents to vacate upon receipt of the repurchase price and P25.00 in taxes, and allowing them only the right to *remove* their improvements, citing Articles 546 and 547 [5-7]. The Respondents appealed, arguing that Article 1616 should apply [7, 8].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the vendor *a retro* may compel the vendee *a retro* to remove useful improvements instead of reimbursing their value to effect redemption.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court ruled that the trial court committed reversible error by applying Articles 546 and 547, which govern possession in general [9]. The specific provision applicable to *conventional redemption* is **Article 1616 of the New Civil Code**, which mandates that a vendor *a retro* cannot exercise the right of repurchase without returning to the vendee not only the price of the sale but also the "necessary and **useful expenses** made on the thing sold" [9, 10]. Unlike the option granted to an owner under Article 547, Article 1616 gives the vendor *a retro* **no option** to require the vendee to remove useful improvements [10]. The vendor must reimburse the value of the useful improvements; otherwise, the vendee *a retro* may retain possession of the land until reimbursement is made [10].

The decision of the trial court was reversed and set aside, and the case was remanded for the determination of the value of the improvements [11].
