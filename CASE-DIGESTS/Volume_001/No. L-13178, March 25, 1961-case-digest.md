I. CAPTION
PAMPANGA SUGAR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13178, March 25, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
The PASUDECO Workers Union was chosen as the exclusive bargaining representative of Pampanga Sugar Development Company's (PASUDECO) employees and had an existing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the company [1]. The Sugar Workers Association, a minority union that lost the election, submitted demands to the company regarding wages and benefits [2]. When these demands were not heeded, the minority union staged a strike during the 1955-1956 milling season [2]. Deeming the industry indispensable to the national interest, the President of the Philippines certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) pursuant to Section 10 of Republic Act No. 875 [2], [3]. PASUDECO challenged the CIR's jurisdiction, arguing that a minority union has no right to represent employees or create a cognizable labor dispute given the existence of a certified majority union and a CBA [4]. The CIR declared itself with jurisdiction, prompting PASUDECO to file a petition for certiorari [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over a labor dispute certified by the President when said dispute is caused by a minority union despite the existence of an exclusive bargaining representative and a collective bargaining agreement.

IV. RULING
**YES.** When the President is of the opinion that a labor dispute exists in an industry indispensable to the national interest and certifies it to the CIR, the latter acquires jurisdiction to act thereon as provided by law [5], [6]. The CIR has no alternative but to take jurisdiction; it cannot dismiss the case on the assumption that the certification was erroneous [5], [6]. The power to certify a dispute is the President's prerogative and the propriety of its exercise is not the concern of the Industrial Court [7], [8].

The contention that a minority union cannot create a cognizable labor dispute in disregard of a certified representative and an existing CBA is a legal matter that does not affect the court's jurisdiction [9], [10]. Rather, this is an issue the court must determine *after* the dispute is submitted for decision, along with other matters such as the rights of the minority against abuse or the need for a new certification election [9], [10]. The certification placed the case under the CIR's jurisdiction regardless of the status of the union causing the dispute [8].

Petition denied [11].
