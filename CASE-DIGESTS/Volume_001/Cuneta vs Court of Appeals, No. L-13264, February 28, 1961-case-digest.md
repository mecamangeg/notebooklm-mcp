I. CAPTION
PABLO CUNETA, ETC., ET AL. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13264, February 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Appellees were detectives holding positions in the regular police force of Pasay City [1, 2]. Petitioner City Mayor Pablo Cuneta, pursuant to authority granted by the Municipal Board under Resolution No. 36, adopted Reorganization Plan No. 5, which eliminated the appellees' positions [3-5]. Consequently, appellees were separated from the service without any formal charges filed against them [1]. Appellees filed a mandamus proceeding in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, seeking reinstatement and back salaries [6]. The CFI ruled that the separation was illegal and ordered their reinstatement. The Court of Appeals affirmed the CFI's decision [6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the reorganization was valid and that the Office of the President's approval of the city budget corresponding to the plan cured the lack of express Presidential approval for the reorganization [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the removal of the detectives via the abolition of their positions in the reorganization plan was valid.
2. W/N the approval of the city budget by the Office of the President constituted valid approval of the reorganization plan as required by law.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the detectives, being part of the regular police force, belong to the unclassified class of the civil service [1, 2]. Their removal is governed by the Civil Service Law and Republic Act No. 557, which mandate that police officers can only be removed for misconduct, incompetency, or other specific causes after a public hearing and opportunity for defense [7, 8]. The elimination of their positions through reorganization amounted to a removal without cause and without the filing of formal charges, violating the security of tenure guaranteed by the Constitution and the Pasay City Charter (Republic Act No. 183) [1, 2, 5, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that under Executive Order No. 175, series of 1938, no position in any city police force may be abolished without the approval of the President of the Philippines [3, 5]. The Reorganization Plan No. 5 was never submitted to the President for approval [3]. The Court rejected the petitioners' argument that the approval of the budget by the Office of the President sufficed, holding that such approval does not imply express presidential sanction of the reorganization plan, and a public office cannot be deemed abolished by mere implication [3, 9].

Decision affirmed [9].
