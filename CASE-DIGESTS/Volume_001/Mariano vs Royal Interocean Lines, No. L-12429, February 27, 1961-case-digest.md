I. CAPTION
ERMIDIA A. MARIANO v. THE ROYAL INTEROCEAN LINES (Keninkijke Java-China-Pakitvaart Lijnen N. V. Amsterdam) and J. V. KAMERLING, G.R. No. L-12429, February 27, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Ermidia A. Mariano was employed by defendant Royal Interocean Lines as a stenographer-typist since 1932. On October 5, 1953, she wrote a letter to the company's Managing Directors in Hongkong complaining about the "inconsiderate and untactful attitude" of the Philippine manager, defendant J.V. Kamerling [1]. In response, the company terminated her services on October 23, 1953, citing the tenor of her letter made her continued employment impossible [1, 2]. The company offered her a sum equivalent to six months' salary (P3,108) as a compromise, which she refused [2].

Mariano filed a complaint for damages in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in her favor, declaring the dismissal "summary, unreasonable and arbitrary" and awarding her P13,228.58 in salaries and allowances, plus moral damages and attorney's fees [1, 3]. Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.

Separately, regarding the same dismissal, the Supreme Court had previously reversed a Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) decision in *Royal Interocean Lines vs. Mariano* (G.R. No. L-11745, Oct. 31, 1960), ruling that Mariano's dismissal was not an unfair labor practice because her letter was not connected to union activities [4-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Mariano is entitled to damages for her dismissal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court modified the judgment of the lower court. The Court reiterated its finding in the related case (G.R. No. L-11745) that Mariano's dismissal was not due to union activities. Consequently, she has no cause of action for damages against the employer under the Industrial Peace Act [7]. An employer retains the inherent right to discipline employees and the prerogative to hire or dismiss them, provided it is not used to interfere with the right to self-organization [8, 9].

However, the Court found that the dismissal was "without just cause," noting that the defendants' claim of inefficiency was belied by Mariano's successive salary increases [8]. Therefore, while the award for full damages was unjustified, the Court ruled that she is entitled to the amount equivalent to six months' salary (P3,108) originally offered by the employer [7].

**Disposition:** Judgment modified. Appellants are ordered to pay the appellee the sum of P3,108, without interest. [10]
