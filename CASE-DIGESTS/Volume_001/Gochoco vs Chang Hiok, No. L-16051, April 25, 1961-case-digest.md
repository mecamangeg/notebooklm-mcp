I. CAPTION
FERNANDO GOCHOCO, ET AL. v. CHANG HIOK @ YU TIAN HUAT, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16051, April 25, 1961, Bengzon, Actg. C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Fernando Gochoco, et al. filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal to annul the sale of real property made by defendant Chang Hiok to Leona Piano, and the subsequent sale by Piano to Rosario Chang. Plaintiffs alleged that these sales were simulated and made in fraud of creditors. Previously, the plaintiffs had obtained a judgment against Chang Hiok in Civil Case No. 27996 in the Manila CFI for approximately P14,000.00, which was pending appeal in the Court of Appeals. They filed the Rizal case to protect their interests, claiming only P5,956.00 had been executed and Chang Hiok had no other visible property [1].

The CFI of Rizal dismissed the complaint on the ground of *litis pendentia* (pendency of another action), specifically the pending Civil Case No. 27996. Plaintiffs appealed, admitting identity of parties and subject matter, but argued that the causes of action were different: the Manila case involved simulation and fraud, while the present case was based on Chang Hiok's failure to fully satisfy the judgment [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action should be dismissed on the ground of *litis pendentia*.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. Under the Rules of Court (Rule 8, Sec. 1), a motion to dismiss may be granted if there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause [3]. The requisites for *litis pendentia* are: (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for; and (3) that the judgment in the pending action would amount to *res judicata* in the present case [2, 3].

The Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the causes of action were distinct. The mere failure to satisfy a judgment is not a legal ground to annul a sale; the plaintiffs must prove that the conveyances were fictitious or in fraud of creditors [4]. Since the issues of simulation and fraud were already specifically raised and under litigation in Civil Case No. 27996, any final decision in that case would be *res judicata* regarding the validity of the sales questioned in the present case [5].

The order of dismissal is affirmed [5].
