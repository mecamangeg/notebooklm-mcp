I. CAPTION
LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION v. CEFERINO ASCUE and FELISA RAMOS DE ASCUE, G.R. No. L-14969, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Ceferino Ascue and Felisa Ramos de Ascue were owners of "Hacienda Baha," an 808-hectare agricultural estate in Calatagan, Batangas [1]. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) sought to acquire the property for resale to tenants pursuant to Republic Act No. 1400. However, negotiations failed because the parties could not agree on who had the right to select the 300-hectare retention area exempt from expropriation under Section 6(2) of the Act [1, 2]. The LTA filed a special civil action for declaratory relief to determine the correct interpretation of the law [3]. The Court of First Instance of Batangas rendered a summary judgment ruling that the landowner had the right to choose the 300 hectares they desired to retain [4]. The LTA appealed this decision to the Supreme Court [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the landowner has the exclusive right to choose the 300-hectare portion exempt from expropriation under Republic Act No. 1400.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not intend to give the landowner the power to choose the portion exempt from expropriation [5]. Section 6(2) of R.A. 1400 is silent on the matter; therefore, the procedure in the Rules of Court regarding eminent domain applies [6]. Under this procedure, the party seeking expropriation (LTA) initially determines the property to be taken, and the owner may object. If the parties cannot agree, the court must settle the issue in accordance with the spirit of the law and the demands of justice and equity [5, 6].

The Court cited legislative records showing that a proposed amendment to explicitly allow the landowner to select the retention area was rejected by Congress [7]. Furthermore, vesting this power solely in the landowner could defeat the law's purpose of resolving agrarian unrest, as the owner might choose to retain the specific portions where conflicts exist, thereby preventing their redistribution [8, 9].

The decision appealed from is MODIFIED.
