I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF ATTY. FILOTEO DIANALA JO, G.R. No. L-15255, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Atty. Filoteo Dianala Jo was the counsel for the defendant-appellant in the criminal case *People v. Yakan Malat* (G.R. No. L-15255) [1]. He failed to file the appellant's brief despite several extensions [1]. Upon being required to explain, he claimed he lost contact with the appellant and that the appellant's relatives disagreed on continuing the appeal [1]. The Court found his explanation unsatisfactory and imposed a fine of P50.00 [1]. Atty. Jo requested an extension to pay the fine, which was granted, but he failed to pay within the extended period [1, 2]. The Court then warned him of arrest and subsequently issued a resolution requiring him to show cause why he should not be suspended [2]. Although Atty. Jo received notice of this resolution on November 25, 1960, he failed to submit any explanation [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Atty. Jo should be suspended from the practice of law.

IV. RULING
**YES.** Atty. Jo is suspended from the practice of law for three (3) months. The Court reasoned that his failure to pay the fine despite extensions and warnings, coupled with his failure to explain his behavior when required to do so, manifested his "contumacity and unwillingness to comply [with] the lawful orders of this Court... in violation of his oath of office" [2].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes, and Dizon concurred [3].
