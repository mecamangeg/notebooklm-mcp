I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANUEL BANIAGA, ET AL., G.R. No. L-14905, January 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of September 8, 1954, six masked men entered a store-restaurant in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. They robbed the owners (spouses Santos) and waitresses of cash and jewelry. During the robbery, the accused Manuel Baniaga raped waitress Arsenia Caoile, while his companions raped the other waitresses. Arsenia positively identified Baniaga as her assailant. The Court of First Instance convicted Baniaga, along with co-accused Brigido Tagubat and Felipe Guntalilib, of the complex crime of robbery with rape, sentencing them to an indeterminate penalty of *reclusion temporal*. Baniaga appealed to the Court of Appeals, raising the defense of alibi. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but found the penalty erroneous due to aggravating circumstances, thus elevating the case to the Supreme Court for review of the penalty.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over positive identification.
2. W/N the penalty of *reclusion temporal* imposed by the trial court was correct.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Alibi is a defense easily concocted and must be received with caution. Where it is supported only by the testimony of relatives and friends, it deserves scant consideration, particularly when the accused was positively identified by the prosecution witnesses. In this case, the victim Arsenia Caoile clearly identified Baniaga, having seen him days prior and recognizing him during the crime, and she had no motive to perjure herself.

2. **NO.** The penalty for robbery with rape is *reclusion temporal* in its medium period to *reclusion perpetua*. The Court found that the aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime were present, with no mitigating circumstances to offset them. Under the law, the penalty must be imposed in its maximum period. Consequently, the decision is MODIFIED and the penalty is elevated to *reclusion perpetua*.
