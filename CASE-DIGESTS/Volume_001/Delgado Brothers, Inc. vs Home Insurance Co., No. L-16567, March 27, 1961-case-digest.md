I. CAPTION
DELGADO BROTHERS, INC. v. HOME INSURANCE COMPANY and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-16567, March 27, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Home Insurance Company, as subrogee of the consignee Judy Philippines, Inc., filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila against Petitioner Delgado Brothers, Inc., the arrastre operator for the Port of Manila. Respondent sought to recover P1,287.20 representing the value of missing/damaged cargo from a shipment arrived via *S.S. Leoville*. Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction because the amount was within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court and the subject matter was not admiralty. The CFI initially denied the motion but later dismissed the case on the merits based on the petitioner's special defenses under the Management Contract. The Court of Appeals reversed the CFI and ordered Petitioner to pay. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, insisting the CFI lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an arrastre contract is maritime in nature such that a claim for damages against the operator falls under the admiralty jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the functions of an arrastre operator are not maritime in nature. Under the Management Contract, the operator's duties—receiving, handling, caring for, and delivering merchandise upon wharves and piers—are distinct from the trade and business of navigation or the operation of vessels [1]. The Court held that these services are akin to those of a depositary or warehouseman [1]. Even if the service assists maritime transportation, it is merely incidental and does not make the contract maritime [2].

Citing *Macondray & Company, Inc. v. Delgado Brothers, Inc.*, the Court reiterated that for a contract to be maritime, it "must be essentially and fully maritime in its character" [2]. Consequently, the suit was not an admiralty case, and since the claim of P1,287.20 was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court (which covered claims not exceeding P10,000), the CFI had no jurisdiction [3]. The Court emphasized that the rule against multiplicity of suits is subservient to the mandatory requirement of jurisdiction [4].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is dismissed.
