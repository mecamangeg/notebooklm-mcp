I. CAPTION
DOMINGO E. LEONOR v. FRANCISCO SYCIP, G.R. No. L-14220, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On July 11, 1955, plaintiff Domingo Leonor leased a building in Pasay City to defendant Francisco Sycip for a period of two years at a monthly rental of P350.00 [1]. Sycip defaulted on payments from July to October 1956, prompting Leonor to file an unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 1972) [1]. This first case was dismissed after Napoleon Coronado assigned his rights under a chattel mortgage executed by Sycip to Leonor to guarantee the rentals due [2].

Sycip continued to default on subsequent rentals and refused to surrender the mortgaged property for extrajudicial foreclosure, violating the chattel mortgage [2, 3]. Leonor then filed a second unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 2067) [2]. The Municipal Court ruled in favor of Leonor [2]. On appeal to the Court of First Instance (CFI), Sycip argued that the assignment of the chattel mortgage constituted a novation that released his obligation and that Leonor could not sue without first rescinding the compromise [4]. The CFI affirmed the judgment ordering Sycip to vacate and pay back rentals [5]. Sycip appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the assignment of the chattel mortgage in favor of the lessor novated the lease contract and released the lessee from the obligation to pay subsequent rentals.
2. W/N the lessor was required to file a judicial action for rescission of the compromise agreement before instituting the unlawful detainer suit.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the assignment of the chattel mortgage, intended to guarantee rentals due up to the date of assignment, did not novate or extinguish the obligation to pay rentals accruing subsequently [6]. There is no incompatibility between the lessee's obligation to pay rent and the security provided; on the contrary, the chattel mortgage bolstered the lessor's remedy and strengthened the effectivity of the obligation [7]. The lessor was not bound to foreclose the mortgage and retained his right to sue for the subsequent rentals and eviction [8].

2. **NO.** Under Article 2041 of the Civil Code, a party aggrieved by the breach of a compromise agreement may "regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand" [9]. Unlike Article 2039, which implies a need to establish a cause for annulment, Article 2041 authorizes the aggrieved party to treat the compromise as rescinded without need for a separate judicial action for rescission [9]. To require a separate action for rescission (which falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance) would defeat the summary nature of the unlawful detainer remedy (filed in the Municipal Court) and improperly split the cause of action [10].

**Decision affirmed.** [11]
