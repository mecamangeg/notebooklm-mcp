**I. CAPTION**
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROGER PERETE Y MANLAPAS,** G.R. No. L-15515, April 29, 1961, Per Curiam.

**II. FACTS**
On March 25, 1959, Roger Perete and Victorio Sajorda, inmates at the New Bilibid Prisons, stabbed their co-prisoner Receval Langlangan to death inside a dormitory toilet [1, 2]. They were charged with murder qualified by treachery, with the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and quasi-recidivism [2]. During arraignment on June 2, 1959, Perete, assisted by counsel *de oficio*, pleaded guilty [3]. Relying on the plea, the trial court convicted Perete of murder. Finding him to be a quasi-recidivist under Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, the court sentenced him to death without receiving further evidence [4]. The case was elevated for automatic review, with the defense arguing that the trial court should have required evidence to prove guilt and that the plea and voluntary surrender should have mitigated the penalty [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the trial court erred in convicting the accused of a capital offense based solely on a plea of guilty without receiving further evidence.
2. W/N the imposition of the death penalty was correct despite the presence of mitigating circumstances.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** A plea of guilty, when formally entered on arraignment, is sufficient to sustain a conviction even for a capital offense without the introduction of further evidence [3, 5, 6]. Such a plea admits all material allegations of the information, including the attendant circumstances qualifying and/or aggravating the crime [3, 5, 6]. While it is the "better practice" to receive additional evidence to ensure the accused understands the import of their plea, this rests on the sound discretion of the trial court [3, 5, 7]. Since Perete was assisted by counsel, the presumption is that counsel faithfully discharged his duty to advise the accused of the meaning of his plea [3, 7, 8].

2. **YES.** The information specifically alleged quasi-recidivism, which the accused admitted through his plea [9]. Under Article 160 of the Revised Penal Code, quasi-recidivism is a special aggravating circumstance that mandates the imposition of the penalty in its maximum period [1, 9]. Consequently, generic mitigating circumstances such as plea of guilt and voluntary surrender cannot lower the penalty [9].

**Decision affirmed.** [10]
