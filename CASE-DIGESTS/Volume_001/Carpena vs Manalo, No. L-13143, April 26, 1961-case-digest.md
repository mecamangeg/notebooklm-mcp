I. CAPTION
DEMETRIO CARPENA, ET AL. v. LUCIANO MANALO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-13143, April 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Beatriz Manalo sold her interest in a lot to Spouses Demetrio Carpena and Salud Catindig. Subsequently, Luciano Manalo (Beatriz's husband) filed Civil Case No. 9194 against the Carpena spouses to annul the sale and recover ownership of the property [1, 2]. In that previous case, the Carpenas filed an answer claiming they were the true owners by virtue of the deed of sale, essentially filing a counterclaim for *accion reivindicatoria*, but they failed to claim rents or compensation for the use and occupancy of the property [3, 4].

The Carpenas later filed the present action (Civil Case No. 9630) to recover possession of the lot and house, as well as rentals from August 1, 1948 [5]. The lower court declared the Carpenas owners of the house but dismissed their claim for rentals/damages, ruling that it was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been set up in the prior Civil Case No. 9194 and was now barred [6]. The Carpenas appealed, arguing the rental claim was not within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance due to the amount and that there was no mutuality of parties [3, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the plaintiffs' claim for rentals is barred for failure to plead it as a compulsory counterclaim in the previous litigation (Civil Case No. 9194).

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the claim for rentals was a compulsory counterclaim in the previous case [8]. A counterclaim necessarily connected with the transaction or occurrence constituting the subject matter of the complaint is compulsory and is barred if not pleaded [9, 10].

The Court reasoned that the right to collect rents was necessarily connected to the validity of the sale and the question of ownership litigated in Civil Case No. 9194 [2]. Citing *Berses v. Villanueva*, the Court held that in an action for recovery of land, a defendant must set up a counterclaim for the value of improvements (or in this case, rents), otherwise the claim is barred [11].

Regarding the appellants' arguments:
1.  **Jurisdiction:** The Court rejected the argument that the rental amount was below the jurisdictional threshold of the CFI. Since the money demand was incidental to the main counterclaim for ownership and possession, the CFI had authority to take cognizance of it [4, 12].
2.  **Parties:** The Court rejected the argument regarding lack of mutuality of parties (due to the inclusion of additional defendants in the second case). A party cannot evade the doctrine of *res judicata* by simply adding or eliminating parties in subsequent litigation [7, 12].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [8].
