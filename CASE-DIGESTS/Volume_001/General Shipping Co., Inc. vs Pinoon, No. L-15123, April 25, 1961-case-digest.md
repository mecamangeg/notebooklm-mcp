I. CAPTION
GENERAL SHIPPING COMPANY, INC. v. SATURNINO C. PINOON, G.R. No. L-15123, April 25, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
General Shipping Company, Inc. (Appellee) filed a complaint against Saturnino C. Pinoon (Appellant) to recover P12,012.33, representing the balance of freight and fare collections. The claim was based on a promissory note executed by Pinoon on November 15, 1955, acknowledging an indebtedness of P13,873.38 [1].

Pinoon initially filed an answer and an amended answer admitting the material allegations but contesting the attorney's fees. Subsequently, he filed a motion for leave to file a **Second Amended Answer**, alleging that upon a subsequent check, he had actually collected only P10,240.62, not the amount stated in the note. Deducting his partial payment, he claimed the true balance was only P8,379.57 [2], [3], [4].

The trial court admitted the Second Amended Answer. However, the Appellee moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the Appellant had already admitted the material averments. The trial court granted the motion and rendered judgment on the pleadings, ruling that Pinoon was liable for the full amount in the note as he was likely aware of uncollected accounts when he signed it [5], [6]. Pinoon appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N judgment on the pleadings is proper when the defendant's admitted Second Amended Answer tenders an issue regarding the accuracy of the amount owed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that judgment on the pleadings was improper.

Under the Rules of Court, a defendant may set up as many affirmative defenses as they have, including matters of confession and avoidance [7]. While Pinoon did not deny the genuineness of the promissory note, his Second Amended Answer—which the trial court expressly allowed—specifically denied the correctness of the amount stated in the complaint and the note [8], [3]. He alleged a discrepancy based on actual collections and claimed a lesser indebtedness [6].

By disputing the amount due, the Second Amended Answer tendered a genuine issue of fact. Consequently, a judgment on the pleadings under Section 10, Rule 35 (now Rule 34) could no longer be had [6]. The Appellant should have been afforded the opportunity to prove the correctness of his figures during a trial rather than having the court draw inferences against his specific defenses [6].

The judgment appealed from is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings [9].
