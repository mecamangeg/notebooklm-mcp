**I. CAPTION**
MARIANO RODRIGUEZ and MARINA RODRIGUEZ v. PORFIRIO BELGICA and EMMA BELGICA, G.R. No. L-10801, February 28, 1961, Paredes, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Rodriguez and defendants Belgica were co-owners of two parcels of land, owning 86% and 14% respectively. In a partition case involving the properties, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement approved by the Court of First Instance on August 30, 1955 [1, 2]. The agreement stipulated that the plaintiffs would convey an additional 36% share of the land to the defendants upon payment of P35,000.00 within 70 days [3, 4]. Crucially, the plaintiffs agreed to grant authority to defendant Porfirio Belgica to sell or mortgage said 36% share to raise the P35,000.00 [4].

On November 19, 1955, after the 70-day period lapsed without payment, plaintiffs moved to segregate the defendants' original 14% share, effectively cancelling the option to buy the additional 36% [5]. Defendants opposed and filed a motion to compel plaintiffs to grant the authority to sell/mortgage, arguing that their inability to pay was due to plaintiffs' refusal to grant said authority [5]. The trial court denied the defendants' motion, ruling that the judgment had become final and executory because the motion to compel was filed after the 70-day period expired [2, 6].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the 70-day period for payment commenced and expired despite the plaintiffs' failure to grant the defendants the authority to sell or mortgage the property.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the compromise agreement established **reciprocal obligations** between the parties [7]. The sequence of performance is clear: the giving of the authority to sell or mortgage by the plaintiffs precedes the obligation of the defendants to pay the P35,000.00 [8]. Citing *Martinez v. Cavives*, the Court ruled that until this authority is granted, the 70-day period for payment does not commence to run [9].

Furthermore, demand by the defendants for the plaintiffs to grant the authority was not necessary under Article 1169, par. 2 of the Civil Code because of the nature of the obligation [9]. Onerous compromise agreements must be interpreted in favor of the greatest reciprocity of interests [10]. Therefore, the defendants' obligation to pay did not mature, and their right to purchase the 36% interest was not forfeited [10].

**Disposition:** The resolution of the lower court is **REVERSED**. Plaintiffs are ordered to execute the proper authority to sell or mortgage within 30 days, and defendants are directed to pay the P35,000.00 within 30 days from the grant of such authority [11].
