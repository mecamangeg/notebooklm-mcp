I. CAPTION
CO SAN v. DIRECTOR OF PATENTS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-10563, February 23, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose Ong Lian Bio filed applications and was issued Letters Patent Nos. 6 and 7 for two luggage designs [1]. Petitioner Co San filed a petition with the Philippine Patent Office to cancel these patents under Section 28 of Republic Act No. 165 [1]. During the hearing, the petitioner presented only documentary evidence, relying primarily on a Court of Appeals decision in *People v. Co San* (G.R. No. 11277-R) [2]. In that criminal case, Co San was acquitted of unfair competition regarding the same luggage [2]. The petitioner argued that the Director of Patents was bound by the Court of Appeals' findings that Co San was the prior user of the design and that the respondent's designs were not new or original [3]. The Director of Patents rejected this argument and dismissed the petition for cancellation due to lack of sufficient evidence [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case for unfair competition is binding on the Director of Patents in a proceeding for the cancellation of a design patent.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Director of Patents is not bound by the findings or acquittal in the criminal case [3]. The Court reasoned that the two proceedings are distinct in nature and jurisdiction: the cancellation proceeding concerns the validity of the design patents and is within the cognizance of the Patent Office (Sec. 28, Republic Act No. 165), while the criminal case determines whether the accused committed unfair competition or deceit, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance (Art. 189, Revised Penal Code) [3]. The Court noted that the petitioner's acquittal was based on the finding that he had not deceived or defrauded the respondent, not on the invalidity of the patent [3]. Citing *Worcester v. Ocampo* and *Ogura v. Chua*, the Court held that an acquittal in a criminal prosecution does not constitute *res judicata* in a separate civil or administrative action where the issues and facts are different [5].

The petition for review is dismissed [4].
