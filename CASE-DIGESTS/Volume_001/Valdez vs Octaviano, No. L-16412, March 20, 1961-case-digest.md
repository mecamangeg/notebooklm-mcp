I. CAPTION
AMABLE VALDEZ v. PEDRO OCTAVIANO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16412, March 20, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Amable Valdez filed a complaint against Spouses Pedro and Josefa Octaviano claiming to be a co-owner of a residential lot in Baguio City and demanding P9,300.00 as his share from the sale of a portion of said property [1]. The defendants moved to dismiss the case on the ground of *res judicata*, citing a final decision and amicable settlement in a previous litigation (Civil Case No. 832) involving the same parties and subject matter [1]. Valdez opposed the dismissal, arguing that the defendants failed to pay him the P300.00 reimbursement stipulated in the amicable settlement [1]. He contended that this failure rescinded the settlement and restored the *status quo*, allowing him to litigate the property again [1]. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint, ruling that *res judicata* existed as Valdez had already renounced his rights to the land in the prior judgment [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the failure to comply with the terms of an amicable settlement rescinds it and allows the aggrieved party to litigate the property anew.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal [4]. The Court ruled that a mere failure to comply with the terms of an amicable settlement—such as the failure to pay the stipulated amount of P300.00—cannot have the effect of rescinding or nullifying the agreement [5]. The proper remedy for the aggrieved party is to file a motion for the execution of that specific portion of the judgment, rather than to litigate anew the property which was already the subject of the settlement [5, 6]. Since the judgment in the previous case involving the same property and parties had already become final and executory, the present action is barred by *res judicata* [5, 7].
