I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ESTANISLAO MANGAHAS, G.R. No. L-13982, January 28, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
On May 8, 1956, in San Ildefonso, Bulacan, neighbors found the accused, Estanislao Mangahas, weeping beside the dead body of his wife, Virginia Coderes, who was hanging from a roof beam [1]. Mangahas initially claimed she committed suicide [1]. However, he later executed an extrajudicial confession (Exhibit "A") before the police and the Justice of the Peace, admitting that following a quarrel over a town fiesta where his wife insulted him, he beat her, hit her with a piece of wood rendering her unconscious, and then hanged her [2-4]. He also pleaded guilty during arraignment in the Justice of the Peace court [3].

The Court of First Instance of Bulacan convicted him of parricide, appreciating two mitigating circumstances: obfuscation and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* [1]. Mangahas appealed, retracting his confession and insisting on the defense of suicide [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused is guilty of parricide based on his extrajudicial confession.
2. W/N the mitigating circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The guilt of the accused was established beyond reasonable doubt. The Court held that the extrajudicial confession, where he admitted beating and hanging his wife, was corroborated by the physical evidence, specifically the contusions found on the victim's body which were consistent with the blows he described [4, 7]. Furthermore, he voluntarily pleaded guilty before the Justice of the Peace court [3, 5]. His defense of suicide was discredited because the bamboo walls of the house could not have caused the severe contusions found on the victim [6].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong was not sufficiently proved [8]. If the accused lost control of himself when he hanged his wife, this cannot be considered a separate mitigating circumstance of lack of intent; rather, it is deemed part of the obfuscation produced by the quarrel [8]. The Court found that only the mitigating circumstance of obfuscation attended the commission of the crime [8].

The appealed decision is **MODIFIED**, finding the accused guilty of parricide with the sole mitigating circumstance of obfuscation [8, 9].
