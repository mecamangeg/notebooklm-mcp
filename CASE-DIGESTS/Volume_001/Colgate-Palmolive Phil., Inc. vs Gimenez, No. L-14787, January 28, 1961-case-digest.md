I. CAPTION
**COLGATE-PALMOLIVE PHILIPPINES, INC. v. HON. PEDRO M. GIMENEZ as Auditor General and ISMAEL MATHAY as AUDITOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-14787, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Colgate-Palmolive Philippines, Inc. imported materials such as irish moss extract, sodium benzoate, and precipitated calcium carbonate to be used as stabilizers and flavors for dental cream [1]. On March 14, 1956, petitioner filed with the Central Bank applications for the refund of the 17% special excise tax it paid on the foreign exchange used for said importations, totaling P113,343.99 [1]. The claim was based on Section 2 of Republic Act No. 601 (Exchange Tax Law), which grants refunds for foreign exchange used to import "stabilizer and flavors" [1].

The Officer-in-Charge of the Exchange Tax Administration approved a reduced amount of P23,958.13 [1]. However, the Auditor of the Central Bank refused to pass the claim in audit, arguing that the exemption for "stabilizer and flavors" under the law referred only to those used in the preparation of food and food products [1]. Petitioner appealed to the Auditor General, who affirmed the Auditor's ruling on December 4, 1958, applying the statutory construction principle that general terms are limited by the specific words associated with them [2, 3]. Petitioner then filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the foreign exchange used for the importation of dental cream stabilizers and flavors is exempt from the 17% special excise tax under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 601 [2].

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the term "stabilizer and flavors" in R.A. No. 601 is not limited to materials used for food products. While the term is preceded by food items (e.g., rice, flour, canned milk), it is followed by items that do not belong to the food classification, such as "fertilizer," "poultry feed," and "vitamin concentrate" [3]. The rule of statutory construction relying on specific terms to limit general terms applies only when all items in the enumeration belong to one specific class [3]. Since the list includes non-food items, this rule does not apply.

Furthermore, the Court applied the principle *Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguire debemos* (Where the law does not distinguish, neither do we distinguish) [4]. Since the law does not distinguish between stabilizers used for food and those for dental cream, the Court cannot make such a distinction and must construe the words in their general sense [4].

The decision of the Auditor General is **REVERSED**, and respondents are ordered to audit the approved applications for refund in the amount of P23,958.13 [5].
