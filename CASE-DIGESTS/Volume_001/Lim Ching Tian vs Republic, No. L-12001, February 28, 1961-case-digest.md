I. CAPTION
JESUS LIM CHING TIAN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-12001, February 28, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Jesus Lim Ching Tian, a Chinese citizen born in 1933 and residing in Cebu since 1936, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu [1, 2]. The petition was supported by a joint affidavit of character witnesses Manuel R. Valenzuela and Vicente D. Flores [1]. The CFI granted the petition [1]. The Republic appealed, specifically challenging the competency of witness Vicente D. Flores [3].

Evidence showed that Flores first met the petitioner in 1939 and 1940, but the association was casual and interrupted by the war [3]. Flores claimed to know the petitioner intimately only starting in 1950, but admitted his knowledge thereafter was intermittent [3]. Cross-examination revealed significant inconsistencies indicating a lack of familiarity: Flores estimated the petitioner was 15 or 16 years old in 1939 when he was actually only 6, and claimed the petitioner began working in 1950 when he actually started in 1953 [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N character witness Vicente D. Flores was competent to vouch for the petitioner's naturalization.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Flores was not a competent witness and reversed the lower court's decision.

Under **Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473**, a vouching witness must have actually known the applicant for the requisite period to be competent [5]. The Court explained that a witness acts as an "insurer of the character of petitioner," compelling the court to rely on their testimony [5]. Therefore, a witness is only competent to testify on the applicant's moral fitness if they had the opportunity to observe the applicant personally, if not intimately, during the entire period required by law [5].

Flores failed to meet this standard as his association with the petitioner was not continuous and was filled with factual discrepancies regarding the petitioner's age and employment [3, 4]. Citing *In re Kornstein* and *Cu v. Republic*, the Court held that Flores did not possess the necessary knowledge to act as a character witness [5].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [6].
