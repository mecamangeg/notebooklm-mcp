I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SEGUNDO ABEJERO Y CID, G.R. No. L-13470, March 27, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
On July 5, 1957, Segundo Abejero y Cid entered the Bicol Central Academy Building in Camarines Sur through a window and stole various items valued at P269.00. During the preliminary investigation, the Justice of the Peace warned him that a guilty plea could be used against him, yet he insisted on pleading guilty. On November 6, 1957, upon arraignment at the Court of First Instance and assisted by counsel *de oficio*, Abejero entered a plea of guilty. The trial court convicted him of robbery and imposed an indeterminate penalty. Subsequently, Abejero, through a private counsel (*counsel de parte*), filed a motion to set aside the judgment and change his plea to not guilty, alleging that he was a minor, suffered from a mental defect, and was unaware of the consequences of his plea. The trial court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in denying the motion to set aside the judgment and allow the change of plea from guilty to not guilty.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that since the accused was assisted by counsel during the arraignment, the trial court was no longer duty-bound to warn him of the seriousness and consequences of his plea, citing *People v. Dacio* [1]. Furthermore, the accused had already been warned by the Justice of the Peace during the preliminary investigation regarding the import of a guilty plea but persisted [2]. Being a third-year high school student, Abejero could not profess ignorance of the consequences of his act, and his claim of mental defect was unproven and deemed an afterthought [2].

However, the Court modified the penalty to conform with the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the Revised Penal Code (Article 294, par. 5). The judgment was **MODIFIED** as to the penalty only.
