I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. FAUSTO LINDE and MANUEL PRISNO, G.R. No. L-10358, January 28, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
On the night of April 27, 1955, in Palo, Leyte, five armed men, including appellants Fausto Linde and Manuel Prisno, entered the house of Leocadio Planillo by pretending to be peace officers [1]. Inside, Linde, Prisno, and a companion referred to as "Gen" took turns raping Sixta Cadaves, while other companions robbed the house of personal effects worth P64.80 and raped 16-year-old Francisca Planillo [1-3]. The victims and witnesses positively identified Linde (a relative of the witnesses) and Prisno [4]. Linde executed an extra-judicial confession admitting guilt but later retracted it during trial, claiming it was obtained through torture by Constabulary soldiers [5, 6]. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted both appellants of robbery with multiple rape and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua* [7]. The appellants appealed, relying on the defense of alibi and challenging the admissibility of Linde's confession [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi is meritorious against positive identification.
2. W/N the extra-judicial confession of Linde is admissible against him and his co-accused Prisno.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the defense of alibi has no weight whatsoever if the perpetrators have been positively identified by eyewitnesses [4, 8]. The witnesses knew Linde prior to the incident, and the crime scene was only 1.5 kilometers from his residence, making it physically possible for him to be present [4].

2. **YES.** The Court rejected Linde's claim of maltreatment as a "figment of his imagination" because he failed to complain to the Justice of the Peace or submit to a physical examination, and the confession contained details only he could have supplied [9, 10]. Furthermore, regarding Prisno, the Court ruled that where conspiracy is established, the confession of one accused is admissible and can be considered corroborative evidence against the other, citing *People vs. Piamonte* [8, 10].

The judgment of the lower court is **AFFIRMED** [11, 12].
