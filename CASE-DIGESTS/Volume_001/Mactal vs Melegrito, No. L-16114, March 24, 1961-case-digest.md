I. CAPTION
MIGUEL MACTAL v. FILOMENO MELEGRITO, G.R. No. L-16114, March 24, 1961, Concepcion, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
On February 5, 1953, plaintiff Miguel Mactal gave defendant Filomeno Melegrito P1,777.00 to purchase palay for him, with a 10% commission. The agreement stipulated that if Melegrito failed to buy the palay, he must return the money within 10 days [3]. Melegrito failed to do either, prompting Mactal to file a case for *estafa* against him in the Justice of the Peace Court of Guimba, Nueva Ecija [3].

On October 19, 1953, the Chief of Police persuaded Mactal to dismiss the criminal case if Melegrito would promise to pay the amount. Melegrito signed a promissory note acknowledging the debt of P1,777.00, payable in January 1954 [3, 4]. Consequently, the *estafa* case was dismissed [5]. When Melegrito failed to pay the note, Mactal filed a civil action for collection. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the complaint, ruling that the consideration for the promissory note was the dismissal of the *estafa* case, which it deemed illicit, immoral, and void *ab initio* [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the promissory note is void for having an illicit consideration (dismissal of the criminal case). [2]

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. The Court held that the consideration for the promissory note was the **pre-existing debt** of P1,777.00, not the dismissal of the *estafa* case [5]. Melegrito admitted his indebtedness, having received the money to buy palay [5]. The dismissal of the criminal case merely furnished the occasion for the execution of the promissory note [6, 7].

The Court applied the doctrine that a new obligation based on a pre-existing liability is valid and enforceable, distinct from the dismissal of the criminal charge. Citing *Garrido v. Cardenas* and *Hibberd v. Rohde*, the Court reasoned that the instrument is not void simply because it was executed to settle a criminal liability, provided the monetary obligation actually exists and is admitted by the debtor [5].

The decision of the lower court is **REVERSED** [1].
