I. CAPTION
ZAMBALES COLLEGES, INC. v. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16371, March 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Zambales Colleges, Inc. filed a suit for damages against Ciriaco Villanueva in the CFI of Zambales. Villanueva answered with a counterclaim alleging three causes of action: (1) malicious filing of criminal cases against him in 1951; (2) filing a 1955 estafa case based on the same facts as the complaint; and (3) malicious manner of serving a warrant of arrest on a Saturday to detain him over the weekend.

Petitioner moved to dismiss the counterclaim but was denied. Petitioner failed to answer the counterclaim within the statutory period, leading the trial court to declare it in default. Subsequently, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing Petitioner’s complaint and awarding damages to Villanueva on all three counterclaim causes of action. While Petitioner’s appeal was pending, the trial court ordered the execution of the judgment on the counterclaim. Petitioner filed for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) to annul the execution, but the CA denied the petition, ruling that a party in default cannot appeal.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the declaration of default against Petitioner on the counterclaim was valid.
2. W/N a party declared in default has the standing to appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **YES, as to the first and third causes of action; NO, as to the second.** The Supreme Court held that the first and third causes of action raised new factual issues (malicious prosecution and improper service of warrant) unrelated to the complaint [1, 2]. Under the Rules of Court, a plaintiff must answer new issues in a counterclaim; failure to do so warrants default [2]. However, the declaration of default regarding the second cause of action was a nullity [3]. This cause of action was based on facts already alleged in the complaint, and an answer would merely require a restatement of issues already raised [3]. Relying on *Navarro and Binoya vs. Bello*, the Court ruled that a plaintiff is not bound to answer a counterclaim that merely replays the complaint's factual allegations [3].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that a petition for certiorari cannot be a substitute for an appeal [4]. Furthermore, by failing to move for the reconsideration or lifting of the order of default, the Petitioner foreclosed its right to appeal from the portions of the judgment rendered in default [5, 6]. Consequently, the judgment on the first and third causes of action became final and executory due to the Petitioner's negligence [6].

**Petition is GRANTED IN PART.** The judgment is modified such that the order of execution is confined only to the awards for the first and third causes of action. The award for the second cause of action is excluded from execution as the default was void and the appeal on its merits remains pending [6].
