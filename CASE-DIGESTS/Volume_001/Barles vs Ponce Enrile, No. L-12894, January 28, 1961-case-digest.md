**I. CAPTION**
LILIA JUANA BARLES, MARIA ESTRELLA BARLES and REMEDIOS BARLES v. DON ALFONSO PONCE ENRILE, G.R. No. L-12894, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

**II. FACTS**
Plaintiffs Lilia Juana Barles et al. filed an action for declaration or investigation of paternity against defendant Don Alfonso Ponce Enrile. The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription. The Supreme Court reversed this dismissal in a decision promulgated on September 30, 1960. Defendant filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that the action to investigate "spurious" (illegitimate other than natural) paternity must be brought within five years under Article 1149 of the New Civil Code. The defendant contended that Article 285 of the Civil Code applies exclusively to natural children and serves only as a condition precedent, not a prescriptive period [1-3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the action to investigate the paternity of illegitimate (spurious) children is governed by the prescriptive periods in Article 285 of the Civil Code.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that Article 285 of the New Civil Code governs the period within which both the action for compulsory recognition of natural children and the action for the investigation of paternity of illegitimate children other than natural (spurious) may be brought [4, 5].

The Court rejected the defendant's argument that Article 1149 applies, noting that Article 1148 expressly states that limitations in that title are without prejudice to those specified in other parts of the Code [6]. Public policy requires special prescriptive periods for actions involving filiation [7]. Citing *Zuzuarregui v. Zuzuarregui*, the Court affirmed that Article 285 limits not only actions for recognition by natural children but also actions for investigation of paternity by illegitimate children [8].

Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration was **DENIED** [9].
