I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LEONCIO CURAMBAO, GODOFREDO DAGAYLOAN, GERONIMO CRUZ, EUFROSINO SALARDA, VENANCIO CADUNGOG, EUSTAQUIO DURAN, SAYENG SANDAL, ANDRES SALIBAT, and JOHN DOE**, G.R. No. L-10557, January 28, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
On September 16, 1952, a police posse in Zamboanga del Norte led by Sgt. Leoncio Curambao, including appellant Eustaquio Duran, went to the house of three Subanos—Blasa Dansalan, Tigwasan Molaong, and Basilan Laktayan—ostensibly to arrest them for investigation. Sgt. Curambao ordered the three to leave their house. As Basilan Laktayan walked slowly towards the police, Sgt. Curambao shot and killed him. Immediately after, Curambao ordered his men to "fire." The policemen, including Duran, fired in rapid succession at Blasa and Tigwasan, who were standing unarmed in their yard, killing them instantly.

The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga convicted the accused of triple murder. While the other accused withdrew their appeals, Duran pursued his appeal, arguing lack of conspiracy and that he merely obeyed orders.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N appellant Duran is criminally liable for the death of the first victim, Basilan Laktayan.
2. W/N appellant Duran is criminally liable for the deaths of Blasa Dansalan and Tigwasan Molaong.
3. W/N the crime committed regarding Blasa and Tigwasan is Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Duran is not liable for the death of Basilan Laktayan. There was no conspiracy to kill Basilan; the group's original purpose was merely to bring the victims to the station. Duran cannot be held responsible for the sudden, distinct act of his superior, Sgt. Curambao, who shot Basilan without the others' prior agreement [1, 2].

2. **YES.** Duran is liable for the deaths of Blasa and Tigwasan. Witnesses testified that upon Curambao's order to "fire," the policemen, including Duran, fired at the remaining victims. Since Duran actually fired at them, it is immaterial whether a conspiracy existed, as his direct participation was established. His claim of insufficient proof was rejected because the defense admitted his testimony would only corroborate the other policemen who admitted firing [1, 3].

3. **NO.** The crime is **Homicide**, not Murder. First, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not alleged in the Information [2, 4]. Second, treachery cannot be appreciated against Duran personally because he did not deliberately employ means to ensure the killing without risk to himself; he merely fired upon the order of his superior [2, 4].

**Disposition:** The decision is **MODIFIED**. Appellant Duran is **ACQUITTED** regarding the death of Basilan Laktayan. He is found **GUILTY** of two (2) crimes of **Homicide** for the deaths of Blasa Dansalan and Tigwasan Molaong [5, 6].
