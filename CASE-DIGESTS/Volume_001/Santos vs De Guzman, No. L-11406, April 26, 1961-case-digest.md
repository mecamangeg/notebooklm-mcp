I. CAPTION
MARIANO J. SANTOS v. ALEJANDRO DE GUZMAN, G.R. No. L-11406, April 26, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santos filed a petition in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) to eject respondent tenant De Guzman from his landholding in Angono, Rizal, as the land was included in an approved homesite subdivision. De Guzman counterclaimed for expenses he incurred in leveling the land and constructing dikes (pilapil), and for indemnity regarding a portion of the land he was prevented from tilling in 1953 due to road construction by Santos.

The CAR rendered a decision on June 12, 1956, authorizing the ejectment but ordering Santos to pay De Guzman P276.00 for the improvements (leveling and dikes), deeming them "necessary expenses." The court also ordered further hearings to determine the harvest average for the 1953 indemnity claim. A supplemental decision was issued on September 17, 1956, awarding said indemnity. Santos filed a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period if counted from the supplemental decision, but the CAR denied it in an Order dated October 16, 1956, ruling that the June 12 decision was already final. Santos appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the tenant is entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred in leveling the land and constructing dikes.
2. W/N the period for appeal should be computed from the date of the original incomplete decision or the supplemental decision.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The expenses for leveling the land and constructing dikes are not "necessary expenses" (those made for the preservation of the property), but rather "useful expenses." Useful expenses are refundable only to a possessor in good faith. A tenant, whose possession is precarious, is not a possessor in good faith in relation to his landlord. Citing *Alburo v. Villanueva*, the Court held that the tenant's only right regarding such improvements is to remove them if possible without injury to the property. Consequently, the award of P276.00 was improper.

2. **YES.** The appeal period should be computed from the receipt of the supplemental decision. The original decision of June 12, 1956, was incomplete as it left the issue of indemnity for the 1953 dispossession unresolved and ordered further proceedings. To require separate appeals for the original and supplemental decisions would result in multiplicity of appeals. Since Santos filed his motion for reconsideration 12 days after the supplemental decision, his appeal was timely.

The decision of June 12, 1956, is **MODIFIED** (deleting the reimbursement award) and **AFFIRMED** in other respects; the supplemental decision is **AFFIRMED**; and the Order of October 16, 1956, is **REVERSED**.
