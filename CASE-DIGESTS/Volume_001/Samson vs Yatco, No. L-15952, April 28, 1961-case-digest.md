I. CAPTION
SYBIL SAMSON, represented by his mother CONSUELO ENRIQUEZ-SAMSON and CONSUELO ENRIQUEZ-SAMSON v. HON. NICASIO YATCO, ARSENIO SAMSON and DOROTEA ANGELES VDA. DE SAMSON, G.R. No. L-15952, April 28, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Consuelo Enriquez-Samson and respondent Arsenio Samson were married in 1953 but separated in 1954 due to maltreatment by Arsenio's mother. Arsenio failed to provide support for Consuelo and their minor child, Sybil [1, 2]. Consuelo filed a petition for support (Civil Case No. Q-2620) in the Court of First Instance of Rizal [3]. The trial court granted support *pendente lite* of P120.00 [2].

During the hearing on February 3, 1958, petitioners failed to appear. Their counsel moved for postponement, presenting a medical certificate stating Sybil was sick. Respondent Judge Yatco sent a municipal health officer to verify the child's condition, who reported that Sybil only had a slight fever and was walking [4]. Believing the court was misled, Judge Yatco dismissed the case *with prejudice* [5]. Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied, and their appeal was disallowed for being filed late [6]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for support *with prejudice* due to the petitioners' failure to appear.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the dismissal was a "grievous and crass error" amounting to excess of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion [7, 8]. The dismissal was based on the flimsy ground of the health officer's findings, which did not necessarily contradict the attending physician's certification of the child's serious condition days earlier [7]. Furthermore, the child's presence was not necessary for the hearing as counsel was ready to present other witnesses [7].

Crucially, the Court emphasized that the right to support cannot be renounced under **Article 301 of the Civil Code** [9]. If the order of dismissal *with prejudice* were allowed to stand, the petitioners would be unlawfully deprived of their right to present and future support, which the law protects against waiver [9].

The petition for certiorari is **GRANTED**, and the orders dismissing the case are annulled [9].
