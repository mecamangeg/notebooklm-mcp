**I. CAPTION**
**MAGDALENA C. DE BARRETTO, ET AL. v. JOSE G. VILLANUEVA, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-14938, December 29, 1962, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Rosario Cruzado sold her rights over a house and lot to Pura L. Villanueva for P19,000. Villanueva paid a down payment and executed a promissory note for the balance but failed to pay the remaining P12,000. Villanueva subsequently secured a clean title over the property and mortgaged it to Magdalena C. Barretto to secure a P30,000 loan, which was duly recorded.

Villanueva defaulted on both obligations. Cruzado filed a suit and obtained a judgment for the unpaid balance, annotated as a lien on the title. Barretto foreclosed on the mortgage, and the court ordered the sale of the property. Cruzado filed a motion claiming an "unpaid vendor's lien," arguing that under Articles 2242 and 2249 of the Civil Code, she should share *pro rata* in the foreclosure proceeds with the mortgagee. The lower court granted the motion and ordered the proceeds to be shared. Barretto appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N an unrecorded unpaid vendor's lien shares *pro rata* with a recorded mortgage in the proceeds of a foreclosure sale absent an insolvency proceeding.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration and reversed its original decision.

The Court ruled that the specific preferred credits enumerated in Article 2242 of the Civil Code (such as an unpaid vendor's lien) constitute liens within the purview of legal provisions governing insolvency. Therefore, for the *pro rata* sharing under Article 2249 to apply, there must be a general liquidation proceeding (e.g., insolvency, settlement of decedent's estate) where all preferred creditors are convened and their claims adjudicated.

In the absence of such a proceeding, the conflict must be decided under the Torrens system principle that a purchaser in good faith and for value takes registered land free from liens not recorded in the certificate of title. A recorded mortgage is superior to an unrecorded unpaid vendor's lien. The vendor's lien does not acquire the character of a statutory lien co-equal to the recorded mortgage outside of insolvency proceedings.

Furthermore, the Court found that Cruzado was not a true "vendor" as the property was actually sold to Villanueva by the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC), making the RFC the true vendor.

**DISPOSITION:** The judgment appealed from is reversed, and appellants Barretto are declared entitled to full satisfaction of their mortgaged credit out of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.
