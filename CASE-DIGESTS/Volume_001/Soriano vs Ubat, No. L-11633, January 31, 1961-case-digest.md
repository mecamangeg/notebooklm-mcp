I. CAPTION
**INTESTATE ESTATE OF FRANCISCO UBAT, deceased. JOSE L. SORIANO v. ATANASIA UBAT DE MONTES, ET AL., and PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK**, G.R. No. L-11633, January 31, 1961, Paras, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 7, 1936, Eduardo Ubat obtained a P400.00 loan from the Philippine National Bank (PNB), secured by a mortgage. The promissory note stipulated that the principal and interest were payable in ten (10) equal annual installments. It further contained an acceleration clause stating that upon failure to pay any amortization, "all the other amortizations shall then be and become due and payable."

Eduardo Ubat paid three installments before his death. His son, Francisco Ubat, inherited the property and subsequently incurred his own separate debt with PNB. Francisco died in 1954, and intestate proceedings were instituted by Jose L. Soriano. PNB filed claims against the estate for Francisco’s balance and for Eduardo’s unpaid installments due from 1939 to 1945.

The administratrix admitted Francisco's debt but opposed the claim regarding Eduardo’s debt, arguing it had prescribed. She contended that under the acceleration clause, the entire obligation became due upon default of the fourth installment in 1939, triggering the ten-year prescriptive period. The lower court ruled that all installments had prescribed except the tenth one due in 1945. PNB appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action to collect the unpaid installments on Eduardo Ubat's loan has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**PARTIALLY NO.** The Court modified the lower court's decision, ruling that only the fourth and fifth installments had prescribed.

The Court held that the promissory note was a divisible obligation, where each installment gave rise to a separate cause of action [1]. Under Article 1150 of the Civil Code, the prescriptive period counts from the day an action may be brought. The acceleration clause in the note was mandatory ("shall... become due"), meaning PNB's right to sue for the entire debt accrued when the fourth installment was not paid in 1939 [2, 3]. PNB did not waive this clause; thus, the statute of limitations began to run from that default.

However, the Court applied the **Moratorium Law**, which suspended obligations payable during the Japanese occupation and liberation. The Court found that the sixth installment fell due on October 7, 1942 (during the war), not 1941 as argued by the estate [4]. Consequently, the prescriptive period was tolled for the installments falling due during the moratorium. Therefore, only the fourth and fifth installments were barred by prescription. PNB was entitled to recover the remaining installments.

**Decision modified.** The administratrix is ordered to pay PNB the second claim, deducting only the amounts for the fourth and fifth installments.
