I. CAPTION
SMITH, BELL & CO., LTD. v. MANILA PORT SERVICE and MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY, INC., G.R. No. L-14711, April 22, 1961, Padilla, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-Appellee Smith, Bell & Co., Ltd. imported a "Crossley" diesel engine from London. Upon arrival in Manila in July 1957, the cargo was discharged into the custody of Defendant-Appellant Manila Port Service (MPS), the arrastre operator. During delivery, a flywheel fell from a forklift operated by MPS employees and broke because the equipment used was not strong enough to hold the weight. The flywheel was rendered a total loss. Smith, Bell & Co. filed a claim for the value of the damage (P2,027.88) plus expenses. MPS offered to pay only P500, invoking Section 15 of the Management Contract between MPS and the Bureau of Customs, which limits liability to P500 per package unless a higher value is specified and arrastre charges paid. The Court of First Instance of Manila ruled in favor of Smith, Bell & Co. for the full amount, holding that the Management Contract was not binding on the consignee who was not a signatory to it. MPS appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the provision in the Management Contract limiting the arrastre operator's liability to P500 per package is binding on a consignee who is not a party to the contract.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the limitation of liability is binding on the consignee. Citing *Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Line* and *Delgado Bros., Inc. v. Li Yao & Company*, the Court ruled that Section 15 of the Management Contract contains stipulations *pour autrui* (stipulations in favor of a third party). The contract is binding on the consignee who, by taking delivery of the cargo and availing of the arrastre services, effectively accepts the provisions of the Management Contract. Since the consignee did not specify a higher value for the cargo and pay the corresponding charges, the liability of the Manila Port Service is limited to P500 per package.

Judgment modified.
