I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. JUAN REGINALDO, ET AL. and PEDRO PADRON, G.R. No. L-15960, April 29, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
A complaint for Double Murder with Assault upon the Person of an Agent in Authority was filed against Juan Reginaldo, Carlos Dacuycuy, and Pedro Padron in the Justice of the Peace (JP) Court of Bacara, Ilocos Norte [1]. After conducting a preliminary investigation, the JP Court discharged Padron for lack of evidence to show his participation [1].

The records were remanded to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Ilocos Norte. The Provincial Fiscal, refusing to be bound by the JP’s dismissal, conducted his own preliminary investigation, found a *prima facie* case against Padron, and filed an Information charging him as an accomplice [2]. The CFI dismissed the information against Padron and denied the warrant for his arrest, ruling that under Republic Act No. 732 (as interpreted in *Villanueva v. Gonzales*), the Fiscal could not conduct a new investigation or include an accused already discharged by the JP Court [3]. The State appealed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Provincial Fiscal may validly conduct another preliminary investigation and file an information against an accused who was previously discharged by the Justice of the Peace.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that when the Justice of the Peace dismisses a charge after a preliminary investigation, the case stands as if no charge had been made [5]. Consequently, the Provincial Fiscal is not barred from conducting his own investigation of the same charge under Republic Act No. 1799 (amending R.A. 732) [5].

The Court clarified that the ruling in *Villanueva v. Gonzales*—which states the Fiscal *may* rely on the evidence presented in the JP court—applies only when the JP finds a *prima facie* case and elevates the records [6]. It does not prohibit the Fiscal from conducting a separate, independent investigation if the JP dismisses the charge [6]. The Fiscal is not bound by the findings of the Justice of the Peace when the latter dismisses the case [7].

The orders appealed from are reversed, and the case is remanded to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
