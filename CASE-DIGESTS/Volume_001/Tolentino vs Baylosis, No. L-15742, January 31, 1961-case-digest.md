I. CAPTION
MIGUEL TOLENTINO v. CIRILO P. BAYLOSIS, G.R. No. L-15742, January 31, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Miguel Tolentino and respondent Cirilo P. Baylosis were opposing counsels in a civil case involving land titles and damages. In a "Reply to Answer on Counterclaim" filed in that case, respondent Baylosis made several derogatory statements against Tolentino. Specifically, he alleged that the death of Tolentino's clients might be due to the "heavy expenses which they may have suffered from their leader and counsel," that Tolentino was "not of his usual mind" due to old age for asking exorbitant fees, and that he was a losing counsel who lacked legal knowledge. Tolentino filed a suit for damages, claiming these statements were libelous. The Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint. Tolentino appealed, arguing the statements were not privileged. It was also established that prior to these statements, Tolentino had filed a counterclaim attacking Baylosis, linking him to the "Huk" or "PKM" organization and cases of sedition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defamatory statements made by the respondent in his judicial pleadings are absolutely privileged.
2. W/N the petitioner is entitled to damages.

IV. RULING
1. **PARTIALLY**. Statements made in the course of judicial proceedings are privileged only if they are relevant, pertinent, or material to the cause in hand [1, 2]. The test of relevancy is liberal; matters must be "legitimately related" to the subject of inquiry [3]. The Court ruled that respondent’s attacks on petitioner’s professional standing were relevant to the issue of the propriety of the P10,000 attorney's fees claimed by Tolentino, and thus were privileged [4, 5]. However, the statements attributing the clients' deaths to "heavy expenses" caused by counsel and alleging Tolentino was "not of his usual mind" were conjectural, irrelevant to the issues, and therefore *not* privileged [5, 6].

2. **NO**. Although the respondent made unprivileged libelous imputations, the petitioner is not entitled to damages because he did not come to court with clean hands [7, 8]. The records showed that petitioner had previously libeled the respondent in a counterclaim by associating him with seditious organizations [9]. Since petitioner was the first to indulge in offensive personalities, and considering both parties used the proceedings to air personal rancor, the dismissal of the damage claim was proper [8, 10].

The judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.
