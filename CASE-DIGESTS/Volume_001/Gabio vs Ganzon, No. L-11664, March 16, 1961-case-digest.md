I. CAPTION
AMBROSIO GABIO, ET AL. v. RODOLFO GANZON, ET AL., G.R. No. L-11664, March 16, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Ambrosio Gabio, Igmedio Mesa, and Teopista Palma were temporary employees of the Iloilo City Police Force, holding positions as corporal and patrolman [1]. They were originally appointed between November 1945 and September 1946 [1-3]. All their appointments were authorized under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, which provided that the appointees would continue until replaced by an eligible [1-3]. On January 6, 1956, Respondent City Mayor Rodolfo Ganzon summarily dismissed the petitioners, citing their temporary status [4].

Petitioners filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo to declare the dismissal order void. They argued that under Republic Act No. 186, they had acquired civil service eligibility and permanent status because they had rendered continuous service for ten years by the time of their dismissal [5, 6]. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that while they may have become eligible after ten years of service, they were not automatically permanent without new appointments, and thus remained temporary employees subject to dismissal [6]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Republic Act No. 186 applies to temporary employees who had rendered less than ten years of continuous service at the time of the Act's effectivity on June 21, 1947.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that to be entitled to the benefits of Republic Act No. 186, a temporary employee must have rendered continuous service for not less than ten years *on or before* its effectivity on June 21, 1947 [7].

The Court explained that while Section 2 of the Act (covering general employees) is not as explicit as Section 1 (covering teachers, which requires service "to the present time"), the legislative intent was to limit the grant of eligibility to those who had *already* served ten continuous years at the time of the statute's enactment [8, 9]. This interpretation aligns with Administrative Order No. 41, which implemented the Act and required ten years of service on or before June 21, 1947 [7].

Since the petitioners were appointed in late 1945 and 1946, they did not have ten years of service to their credit when the Act became effective in 1947 [10]. Consequently, they did not acquire civil service eligibility or permanent status. They remained temporary employees under Section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, and the respondent Mayor had the authority to terminate their services [10].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [11].
