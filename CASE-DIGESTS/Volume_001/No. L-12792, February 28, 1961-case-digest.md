I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LA ORDEN DE PP. BENEDICTINOS DE FILIPINAS, G.R. No. L-12792, February 28, 1961, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
To solve traffic congestion on Legarda Street, the Government planned to extend Azcarraga Street (now C.M. Recto Avenue) from Mendiola Street to Sta. Mesa Rotonda. To implement this, the Government sought to expropriate approximately 6,000 square meters of property owned by La Orden de PP. Benedictinos de Filipinas, a religious corporation owning San Beda College. After failing to reach an agreement, the Government filed expropriation proceedings [1].

The trial court initially fixed a provisional value of P270,000 and authorized the Government to take possession [2]. However, La Orden filed a motion to dismiss instead of an answer, arguing that the property was already dedicated to public use (education), there was no necessity for the expropriation, and alternative routes were available [3]. On July 29, 1957, without receiving evidence from either party, the trial court dismissed the case, ruling that the expropriation was not of "extreme necessity" based partly on judicial notice [4, 5]. The Government appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court erred in dismissing the expropriation case for lack of necessity without receiving evidence.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that while private property may be expropriated for public use upon payment of just compensation, condemnation is justified only if it is for the public good and there is a genuine necessity of a public character [6]. Courts have the power to inquire into the legality of the exercise of eminent domain and to determine whether there is a genuine necessity therefor, citing *City of Manila v. Chinese Community* [6].

However, the Court ruled that the question of whether the opening of the Azcarraga extension was necessary to relieve traffic congestion was a question of fact. This determination depended on factors not present in the record and could not be resolved solely by the trial court taking judicial notice [7]. Therefore, the parties should have been given the opportunity to present evidence to establish or disprove the necessity of the project.

The Order of dismissal is SET ASIDE and the case is REMANDED to the lower court for further proceedings [8].
