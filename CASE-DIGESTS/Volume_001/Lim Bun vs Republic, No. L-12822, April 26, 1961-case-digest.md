I. CAPTION
LIM BUN v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-12822, April 26, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Lim Bun filed for naturalization in the Court of First Instance of Cebu. The Provincial Fiscal opposed the petition, but the trial court granted it [1]. The Republic appealed, challenging Lim Bun's language proficiency and moral character [1, 2]. During the trial, when asked to write the sentence "Good morning, sir, how are you?", Lim Bun wrote "Good morning, sir, who ras you ?", committing errors that made the sentence unintelligible [2]. Additionally, evidence (Exhibit G) showed that Lim Bun used the alias "Go Se Tam" in his 1951 Alien Certificate of Registration, alongside his baptismal name "Benjamin Lim Bun," without providing authority for the use of said alias [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner possesses the requisite working knowledge of English and Spanish.
2. W/N the petitioner conducted himself in an irreproachable manner despite his unauthorized use of an alias.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner failed to demonstrate a sufficient working knowledge of English and Spanish [2]. His inability to correctly write a simple dictated sentence in English demonstrated a clear deficiency, regardless of his ability to answer oral questions, which the Court surmised was the result of rehearsal [2, 4].
2. **NO.** The petitioner's use of the alias "Go Se Tam" in his official registration documents without the necessary authority violated Commonwealth Act No. 142 (Anti-Alias Law) [3]. This violation indicates that he has not conducted himself properly or in an irreproachable manner in his dealings with the government, thereby disqualifying him from acquiring Philippine citizenship [3].

The decision appealed from is **REVERSED** [5].
