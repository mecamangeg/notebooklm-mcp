I. CAPTION
SY ANG HOC alias MANUEL TE ANG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-12400, March 29, 1961, Paredes, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Sy Ang Hoc, a Chinese citizen born in 1933, arrived in the Philippines in 1937. He was a medical student at the University of Santo Tomas and claimed to be employed as a purchasing agent for his father’s business with a monthly salary of P150.00 (later increased to P180.00). He also claimed to own a house worth P5,500.00 situated on a rented lot. He filed a petition for naturalization, presenting character witnesses Mamerto Cabarroguis and Gerardo Miñosa. The Court of First Instance of Davao admitted him as a Filipino citizen. The Republic appealed, questioning the credibility of the character witnesses, the petitioner's financial capacity, and his compliance with jurisdictional requirements regarding the declaration of intention.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the failure to aver the filing of the declaration of intention in the petition is fatal to the application.
2. W/N the petitioner has a lucrative trade or occupation.
3. W/N the character witnesses presented were qualified.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 requires that the petition for naturalization must contain an averment that the petitioner has complied with the requirements of Section 5, which refers to the filing of a declaration of intention one year prior to the petition. The law specifically mandates that the declaration of intention must be made part of the petition. The Court held that this incorporation is jurisdictional, and failure to aver compliance or attach the declaration is a valid ground for denial [1, 2].

2. **NO.** The Court found that a salary of P150.00 to P180.00 a month is not a lucrative trade or occupation, particularly for a medical student who incurs significant expenses for tuition, board, and lodging. Furthermore, employment by a father in his own business is not convincing evidence of a lucrative trade, as it is possible the salary is merely an allowance. The Court also noted that the petitioner's acquisition of a house on a rented lot appeared to be solely for the purpose of meeting the property qualification [3-5].

3. **NO.** The qualification of witness Gerardo Miñosa was not established. The law requires that a character witness must not only be credible but must also have a good standing in the community, be honest, upright, and reputed to be trustworthy. No evidence was adduced to prove Miñosa possessed these qualifications [6].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision appealed from is **REVERSED** and the petition is **DENIED** [7].
