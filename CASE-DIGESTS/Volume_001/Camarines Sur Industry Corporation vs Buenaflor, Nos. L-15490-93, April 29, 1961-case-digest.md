I. CAPTION
CAMARINES SUR INDUSTRY CORPORATION v. JAIME T. BUENAFLOR, G.R. Nos. L-15490-93, April 29, 1961, Concepcion, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jaime T. Buenaflor filed applications with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate an ice plant and cold storage service in Sabang, Calabanga, Camarines Sur [1]. Petitioner Camarines Sur Industry Corporation opposed, claiming preference as the "pioneer operator" in the area, and filed its own competing applications [2]. However, Buenaflor moved to dismiss petitioner's applications because petitioner's corporate life had admittedly expired in November 1953, years prior to the filing [3]. In response, the stockholders organized a "new" corporation in October 1957 to acquire the assets of the old entity [3]. The PSC granted Buenaflor a certificate for a cold storage service and a one-ton ice plant, while granting the petitioner a certificate for a five-ton ice plant [4]. Petitioner appealed, arguing it should have been granted preference for the cold storage service as well [5]. In a related decision (G.R. Nos. L-14991-94), the Supreme Court had already reversed the grant of the five-ton ice plant to petitioner [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner can invoke the "prior operator" rule to oppose respondent's application.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that an old ice plant operator cannot invoke the "prior operator" rule if it has been functioning illegally because its franchise has already expired [7, 8]. Petitioner's corporate existence terminated in November 1953, and under the Corporation Law, it could not lawfully continue its business of selling ice thereafter [9]. Its continued operation from 1953 to 1957 was illegal, and the Court held that rewarding such illegality by acknowledging a preference would be anomalous [9]. Furthermore, the "new" corporation was not a valid continuation of the old one for this purpose and had not filed a proper application for the certificate [10, 11]. Consequently, petitioner had no standing or authority to claim the preference [11].

The decision of the Public Service Commission is **AFFIRMED** [12].
