I. CAPTION
DEMETRIO B. ENCARNACION v. JOSE L. BALTAZAR and UNION C. KAYANAN, G.R. No. L-16883, March 27, 1961, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
On December 18, 1958, the Provincial Fiscal of Pampanga filed an information for serious slander by deed (Art. 359, RPC) against petitioner Encarnacion with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pampanga [1]. The CFI assumed jurisdiction, issued a warrant of arrest, and granted bail [2]. On August 1, 1959, Republic Act No. 2613 took effect, amending the Judiciary Act of 1948 (RA 296) to grant Justices of the Peace (JP) in provincial capitals concurrent jurisdiction with the CFI over said offense [3, 4]. On August 17, 1959, the CFI remanded the case to the JP Court of San Fernando (presided by respondent Baltazar) for trial [5]. Petitioner moved to quash, arguing the JP Court lacked jurisdiction because the CFI had already acquired it to the exclusion of others [2, 6]. The JP Court denied the motion, ruling it had "special jurisdiction" by assignment [7]. Petitioner filed for certiorari [8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CFI could validly assign the case to the Justice of the Peace Court after RA 2613 established concurrent jurisdiction between them.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The assignment was erroneous and the JP Court acted without jurisdiction. Prior to RA 2613, the CFI had exclusive original jurisdiction over the offense but could assign cases to the JP Court, which would exercise delegated or special jurisdiction [9]. However, RA 2613 granted JP courts in provincial capitals *concurrent* jurisdiction with CFIs over the offense [4].

The Court applied the settled rule that "where several courts have concurrent jurisdiction of the same offense, the court which first acquires jurisdiction of the prosecution retains it to the exclusion of the others" [4]. Since the CFI acquired jurisdiction first (upon filing in 1958), it retained it. The Court held that to rule otherwise would lead to the absurd result of a court assigning the trial of a case to another court of concurrent or equal jurisdiction [10].

Petition granted. Respondent Justice of the Peace is directed to return the records to the CFI of Pampanga [11].
