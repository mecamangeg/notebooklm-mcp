I. CAPTION
BERNARDINO O. ALMEDA v. THE PROVINCIAL TREASURER OF SURIGAO, THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE, JOSE SERING AND JOSE RENDON, G.R. No. L-16148, January 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Bernardino O. Almeda, the Provincial Governor of Surigao, filed a petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction against the respondents. He sought to enjoin Board Members Jose Sering and Jose Rendon from holding sessions without his previous designation of a presiding officer during his absence. Additionally, he sought to prevent the Provincial Treasurer from implementing Resolutions Nos. 1661 to 1664, which were passed by said Board members on October 5, 1959. The Supreme Court initially granted a writ of preliminary injunction [1, 2]. However, before the case could be resolved on the merits, Almeda's term of office expired on December 31, 1959, and a new governor was elected and qualified [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition for prohibition has become moot and academic due to the expiration of the petitioner’s term of office.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that the action has become moot and academic. The petition was brought by Almeda solely in his official capacity as Provincial Governor [3]. Under Rule 3, Section 18 of the Rules of Court, when an officer ceases to hold office, the action may only be maintained by their successor if, within 30 days after taking office, it is satisfactorily shown that there is a substantial need to continue the action [3]. The failure of the incumbent governor to secure substitution evidenced that the issues raised had become moot [3].

Accordingly, the petition is **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction is dissolved [4].
