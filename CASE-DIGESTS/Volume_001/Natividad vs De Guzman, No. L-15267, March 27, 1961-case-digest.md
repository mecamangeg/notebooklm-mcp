I. CAPTION
DOMINGO NATIVIDAD v. PASTOR L. DE GUZMAN, Judge of Court of Agrarian Relations, 7th Regional District, Cebu and CLODUALDA C. MANUBAG, G.R. No. L-15267, March 27, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Domingo Natividad filed a petition for damages for unlawful ejectment against Rosendo Cabal (his landholder) and Clodualda C. Manubag (Cabal's daughter) [1]. Cabal had donated the land to Manubag but retained the usufruct (use and enjoyment) during his lifetime [1]. While the case was pending, Cabal died [1]. Natividad moved to dismiss the case against Cabal and proceed solely against Manubag as the successor-in-interest [1]. The Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) dismissed the case, ruling that under Rule 3, Section 17 of the Rules of Court, the action must be filed against the heirs of the deceased Cabal [1]. Natividad petitioned for certiorari, arguing that under tenancy laws, the obligations passed to the transferee and naked owner, Manubag [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for damages arising from a tenancy relationship proceeds against the transferee/naked owner upon the death of the usufructuary/landholder.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that the lower court abused its discretion in dismissing the case against the transferee [3]. Under **Section 9 of Republic Act No. 1199**, the sale or alienation of land does not extinguish the tenancy relationship, and the "purchaser or transferee shall assume the rights and obligations of the former landholder in relation to the tenant" [4]. The Court distinguished this from **Rule 3, Section 17 of the Rules of Court**, holding that the Rule applies to general obligations transmissible to heirs, but not to obligations specific to agrarian tenancy [5, 6]. Upon the death of the usufructuary (Cabal), the obligations to the tenant passed to the naked owner (Manubag), who is the successor or assignee [5, 6].

The petition is **GRANTED** and the order of dismissal is **SET ASIDE** [3].
