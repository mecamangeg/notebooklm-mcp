I. CAPTION
SILVINO LASTIMOZA and HONORATA GONZALES v. HON. RAMON BLANCO and NESTOR PAÑADA, G.R. No. L-14697, January 28, 1961, Gutierrez David, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Silvino Lastimoza and Honorata Gonzales were adjudicated owners of a parcel of land (Lot No. 14) by the Court of First Instance of Iloilo in Land Registration Case No. N-341 on September 22, 1956 [1]. After obtaining the Original Certificate of Title in 1957, they were placed in possession of the property on July 29, 1958, through a writ of possession which ejected the unlawful possessors, Perfecto Gallego and his family [1].

Subsequently, respondent Nestor Pañada filed a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR), claiming to be a tenant of the ousted Perfecto Gallego since the 1956-1957 agricultural year [2]. Pañada prayed to be maintained as a tenant on the land [2]. The CAR issued an interlocutory order supervising the harvest and denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, which argued lack of jurisdiction due to the absence of a tenancy relationship [2], [3]. Petitioners filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the tenant of a judicially ejected unlawful possessor can invoke security of tenure against the lawful owners, thereby vesting jurisdiction in the Court of Agrarian Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that where the supposed former landholder was an unlawful possessor and intruder judicially ejected from the holding, his tenant cannot invoke the security of tenure guaranteed by the Agricultural Tenancy Law (R.A. No. 1199) [4].

Section 9 of R.A. No. 1199, which provides that the sale or alienation of land does not extinguish tenancy relationships, assumes the existence of a *valid* tenancy relation and contemplates privity of contract or alienation of valid title/possession between the old landholder and the new [4], [5]. In this case, there was no privity between the intruder (Gallego) and the lawful owners (Petitioners) [5]. Under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 1199, a tenancy relationship can only be created with the consent of the true and lawful landholder (owner, lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor), not through the acts of a supposed landholder with no right to the land [5]. Security of tenure is a right guaranteed only to tenants *de jure* [5]. Since there was no tenancy relationship between the parties, the Court of Agrarian Relations lacked jurisdiction to entertain Pañada's petition [6].

The petition for a writ of prohibition is granted, the orders complained of are set aside, and the petition filed with the Agrarian Court by respondent Pañada is dismissed [6].
