I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANTONIO E. DALEON, G.R. No. L-15630, March 24, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Antonio E. Daleon was charged with the crime of malversation of public funds in the Court of First Instance of Quezon [1]. After trial, the lower court found him innocent, acquitted him, and further ordered his reinstatement and the payment of his salary during the period of his suspension from office [1]. The prosecution appealed the decision, specifically questioning the trial court's authority to order the payment of the accused's salary during his suspension [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court, in a criminal judgment of acquittal, has the power to order the payment of the accused's salary during the period of suspension.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that in a criminal action for malversation where the accused is acquitted, the trial court is without power to order the payment of salary during the period of suspension [2, 3]. The Court explained that the only issue joined by the plea of not guilty is whether or not the accused committed the crime charged; thus, the only judgment the court is legally authorized to render is either one of acquittal or of conviction with indemnity and accessory penalties [2, 4]. Relying on *People v. Mañago*, *Pueblo v. Lagutan*, and *Manila Railroad Co. v. Baltazar*, the Court clarified that while an acquitted officer may claim back salaries, the relief must be sought in a proper administrative or civil action, not in the same criminal case [2, 5, 6].

The judgment of the lower court was MODIFIED to eliminate the portion ordering the payment of Daleon's salary during his suspension [7].
