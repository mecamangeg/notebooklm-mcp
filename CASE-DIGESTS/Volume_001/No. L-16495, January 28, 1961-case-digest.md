I. CAPTION
MONICA PASTRANA BAMBAO, ET AL. v. VICTOR E. LEDNICKY, ET AL., G.R. No. L-16495, January 28, 1961, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs-appellants are the successors-in-interest of the Spouses Felix Pastrana and Tomasa Mendoza and one Marcelo, who originally owned fourteen (14) mining claims in Bontoc, Mountain Province, recorded in 1933 [1]. On February 17, 1937, the predecessors sold these claims to defendant Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company for P10,000.00 via a notarized deed of sale [1].

On May 28, 1958—twenty-one years later—plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Baguio City to recover the claims [1]. They alleged the sale was void because the vendors were members of non-Christian tribes and the deed lacked the approval of the Governor of Mountain Province, which they argued was required under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu [1, 2]. They also claimed fraud and misrepresentation by the defendants [1].

The defendants moved to dismiss based on prescription and laches [3]. The CFI dismissed the complaint on the ground of prescription [4]. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing the lower court erred in not accepting evidence on prescription and that the war interrupted the prescriptive period [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to recover the mining claims is barred by prescription.
2. W/N the deed of sale is void for lack of approval by the provincial governor under the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action is barred by prescription. The Court held that the action was filed in 1958, more than twenty-one years after the conveyance in 1937 [6]. Under Sections 40 and 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190), the prescriptive period for the recovery of real property or the acquisition of title via adverse possession is ten years [6, 7]. Even assuming the war interrupted the period (approx. 5 years), the defendants still held adverse possession for about sixteen years [5].

The Court rejected the argument that adverse possession does not apply to mining claims. Upon the perfection of the location of the claims in 1933 (prior to the Constitution), the claims became segregated from the public domain and beneficial ownership vested in the locator as a private right, which can be transferred by adverse possession [8]. Furthermore, the doctrine of laches is rigidly applied to mining claims due to the "sudden and violent fluctuations in value" of such property; plaintiffs' inaction for 21 years converted their claim into a stale demand [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The deed of sale is valid. The Court ruled that Sections 145 and 146 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, which require the Governor's approval for contracts involving non-Christian tribes, apply strictly to the specific territories defined in that Code (Mindanao and Sulu) [2]. The sale in question was executed in Mankayan, Mountain Province, which is outside the territorial application of those provisions [11]. Therefore, the lack of gubernatorial approval did not void the sale.

The order of dismissal is affirmed [10].
