I. CAPTION
GEORGE H. EVANS, petitioner, vs. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and NATALIA ARGUELLES VDA. DE NAVAL, respondents, G.R. No. L-17015, April 29, 1961, 1 SCRA 1342, Barrera, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Natalia Arguelles Vda. de Naval filed a death benefit claim against Dahican Lumber Company for the death of her husband, Fabian Naval. The company denied liability, arguing that Fabian was laid off on July 31, 1952, and the employer-employee relationship had ceased before his death on August 10, 1952. Subsequently, the company went into receivership, and petitioner George H. Evans was appointed receiver. Evans suggested that the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) hear the claim to determine its merits.

On November 4, 1955, the WCC referee issued an order requiring the parties to appear before the Public Defender in Daet "when summoned." However, hearings were conducted in January 1956 without notifying the petitioner. On April 25, 1956, the referee rendered a decision awarding compensation to the respondent widow. Neither the notice of hearing nor a copy of the decision was served on the petitioner. Evans only learned of the adverse decision three years later, on June 12, 1959, upon receiving a demand letter from the WCC. The WCC affirmed the decision, ruling that the petitioner failed to controvert the claim and could be sued without leave of the receivership court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the WCC proceedings were valid despite the lack of notice to the petitioner.
2. W/N the employer admitted liability by failing to submit a report of the employee's death.
3. W/N the receiver could be sued before the WCC without prior permission from the receivership court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The petitioner was clearly deprived of his day in court. The record established that from the 1955 order until the 1959 demand letter, the petitioner received no notice of the trial or the decision. Consequently, all proceedings had by the respondent Commission in connection with the case are null and void and without any legal effect for lack of due process.

2. **NO.** The employer was not bound to submit a report of death under Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act because the death occurred after the employer-employee relationship had already been severed. The company could not have known of the death, nor was it obligated to report it. Furthermore, the company seasonably controverted the claim by denying liability when the claim was first transmitted, stating the deceased was no longer an employee at the time of death.

3. **YES.** The petitioner is estopped from raising this defense as he himself suggested through counsel that the WCC hear the claim. Furthermore, under Section 7, Rule 61 of the Old Rules of Court, a receiver has the power to bring and defend actions in his own name as such, subject to the control of the court in which the action is pending.

The decision and resolution of the Workmen's Compensation Commission are SET ASIDE, and the case is REMANDED to the Commission for further proceedings.
