I. CAPTION
GENERAL BUS CORPORATION and HALCON BUS LINE, INC., substituted by MINDORO TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC. v. GREGORIO CUNANAN, G.R. No. L-16347, April 29, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

II. FACTS
On January 17, 1958, respondent Gregorio Cunanan filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate five TPU units on the Pinamalayan-Bongabong line in Oriental Mindoro. Petitioners General Bus Corporation and Halcon Bus Line, Inc. (later substituted by Mindoro Transportation Company, Inc.) opposed the application, arguing that they already maintained an hourly schedule with 17 trucks and that passenger volume did not warrant new service [1-3].

Cunanan presented evidence showing that passengers often waited one to two hours for petitioners' buses, were frequently left behind due to lack of accommodation, and suffered delays from engine trouble [1]. On November 9, 1958, the PSC granted Cunanan authority to operate three units, finding that public convenience would be promoted. The PSC noted from its own agents' reports that the petitioners' interval of trips was actually one hour or more, and that they often abandoned authorized trips due to insufficient equipment and road conditions [3, 4]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, disputing the PSC's findings of fact [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Public Service Commission properly granted the certificate of public convenience to the respondent.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Public Service Commission. The Court ruled that it will not disturb the Commission's findings of fact regarding public necessity and convenience if there is sufficient evidence to support them [4, 5].

In this case, ample evidence supported the PSC's conclusion. Witnesses testified that passengers had to wait up to two hours and were often not accommodated by the petitioners' buses. Furthermore, reports from the PSC's own agents rebutted the petitioners' claims of frequent service, revealing that petitioners operated fewer units than authorized and abandoned scheduled trips due to road conditions and equipment shortages [4, 6]. Citing *Ynchausti Steamship Co. v. Public Utility Commissioner* and similar cases, the Court held that the grant of three units to the applicant was amply supported by the evidence of public necessity [4].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [7].
