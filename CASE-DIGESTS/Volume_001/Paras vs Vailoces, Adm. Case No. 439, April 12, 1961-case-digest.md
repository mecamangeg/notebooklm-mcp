**I. CAPTION**
**LEDESMA DE JESUS-PARAS v. QUINCIANO VAILOCES**, Adm. Case No. 439, April 12, 1961, Bautista Angelo, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Quinciano Vailoces, a member of the bar and notary public, acknowledged the execution of a document on December 14, 1950, purporting to be the last will and testament of Tarcila Visitacion de Jesus [1]. When presented for probate in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Oriental, the will was found to be a forgery and probate was denied [1]. Subsequently, a criminal action for falsification of a public document was filed against Vailoces [1]. The CFI found him guilty, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty ranging from *prision correccional* to *prision mayor* [1]. After the judgment became final and Vailoces began serving his sentence, the petitioner instituted disbarment proceedings [1]. Vailoces contended that his conviction was based on insufficient evidence and that disbarment would constitute double jeopardy [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the respondent should be disbarred on the ground of conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.
2. W/N the disbarment proceeding constitutes double jeopardy.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** Under Section 27, Rule 138 (formerly Section 25, Rule 127) of the Rules of Court, a member of the bar may be removed if convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude [2]. The Court held that falsification of a public document is clearly contrary to justice, honesty, and good morals, and thus involves moral turpitude [2]. The Court emphasized that it cannot review the merits of a final judgment of conviction in a disbarment proceeding [3].

2. **NO.** The defense of double jeopardy is untenable because it only applies when an accused is prosecuted again for the same offense [4]. Disbarment does not partake of the nature of a criminal proceeding; rather, it is intended to protect the court and the public from the misconduct of officers of the court and to ensure the administration of justice is handled by competent and honorable individuals [4].

**Respondent is removed from his office as attorney and his name is erased from the roll of attorneys.**
