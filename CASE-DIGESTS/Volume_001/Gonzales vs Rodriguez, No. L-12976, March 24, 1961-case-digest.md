I. CAPTION
CESAR GONZALES v. JOSE V. RODRIGUEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-12976, March 24, 1961, Dizon, J. [1, 2]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cesar Gonzales was appointed as a patrolman of Cebu City on September 30, 1950, acting in that capacity until October 16, 1953 [3]. On that date, he was notified by the Acting City Mayor of the termination of his services because his position had been abolished and excluded from the city budget [3]. More than one year and seven months later, on May 19, 1955, Gonzales submitted a written request for reinstatement, which was denied [3]. He subsequently filed a petition for *mandamus* against the City Mayor and other officials to compel his reinstatement [2]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu dismissed the petition, prompting Gonzales to appeal to the Supreme Court [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioner's action for reinstatement is barred by abandonment of office due to the lapse of time. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court ruled that any person claiming a right to a position in the civil service must file his action for reinstatement within one year from his illegal removal from office [4]. Failure to do so results in the petitioner being considered as having abandoned the office [4]. Because Gonzales failed to file his action within the one-year prescriptive period, his claim is barred. The decision of the lower court dismissing the petition is affirmed [5].
