I. CAPTION
LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY and CHARLES B. FOSTER v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and LEONARDO ARCA, G.R. No. L-15171, April 29, 1961, Labrador, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Leonardo Arca was employed by petitioner Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company on July 22, 1953, as a clerk-typist [1]. The employment agreement stipulated that his service would continue until the completion of a specific assignment: the organization of the company's confidential files [1, 2]. On August 22, 1954, petitioners terminated Arca's services, stating they were "no longer needed" [1]. Arca filed a suit for damages, claiming the dismissal was a breach of contract and due to his union activities [1]. Petitioners defended the dismissal, citing "loss of confidence" and dishonesty, alleging Arca was caught "snooping" in the private papers of petitioner General Superintendent Foster, among other acts [3, 4].

The trial court dismissed the complaint, finding the discharge justified due to dishonesty and loss of confidence [4, 5]. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the trial court and ordered Arca's reinstatement with back wages, ruling that his acts—such as writing to the President regarding company store prices—were exercises of civic rights and that the "snooping" was part of his duty to reorganize files [6, 7]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent employee is entitled to reinstatement despite the employer's loss of confidence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that reinstatement is not proper when the employer has lost confidence in the employee [8, 9]. The Court reasoned that it would be "unfair and unjust to the employer to require it to continue employing the services of the person in whom the manager has lost confidence," especially since Arca was intended for a confidential position involving the company's files [9, 10]. The Court found that Arca's conduct rendered him unsuitable for the confidential work for which he was hired [10].

However, the Court ruled that the dismissal before the completion of the specific work assignment constituted a breach of the employment contract [8, 9]. While reinstatement was denied due to loss of confidence, the petitioners were held liable for the damages resulting from the breach [9]. The Court emphasized that if an employer makes a mistake in choosing a person for a position of trust, they may be relieved from continuing the employment but not from liability for damages caused by the breach of contract [9].

**Decision set aside; case remanded to the trial court for the determination of damages [11].**
