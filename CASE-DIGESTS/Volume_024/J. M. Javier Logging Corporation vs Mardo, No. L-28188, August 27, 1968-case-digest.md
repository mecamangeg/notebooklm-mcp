I. CAPTION
J. M. JAVIER LOGGING CORPORATION v. ATANACIO A. MARDO, et al., G.R. No. L-28188, August 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 13, 1966, Jose C. Solomon filed a claim for workman's compensation against petitioner J. M. Javier Logging Corporation. The Regional Office decided in favor of the claimant on July 28, 1967. A copy of the decision was sent by registered mail to petitioner's counsel on August 7, 1967, but no return card appeared on record. Another copy was sent directly to the petitioner corporation, which it received on August 9, 1967.

On August 25, 1967, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. Respondent Acting Chief Referee Mardo denied the motion, ruling that the 15-day period for appeal had expired, counting from the petitioner's direct receipt of the decision on August 9. Consequently, a writ of execution was issued. The Workmen's Compensation Commission en banc affirmed that the decision had become final. The petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, arguing that service upon the party itself was invalid as it was represented by counsel.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N service of a decision upon the party itself, instead of its counsel of record, is valid and effective to start the running of the period for appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that under **Rule 13, Section 2 of the Rules of Court**, if a party appears by an attorney, service must be made upon the attorney, unless service upon the party itself is ordered by the court. In *Notor v. Daza*, the Court ruled that "every written notice" in this rule includes notice of a decision.

Therefore, where a party appears by attorney, notice to the client is not notice in law (*Vivero v. Santos*; *Chainani v. Judge Tancinco*). This rule is founded on considerations of fair play, as a party engages counsel precisely because it is not competent to deal with legal intricacies. Furthermore, service on the client shortens the usable period for protecting the party's interests, as the client must still transmit the notice to its lawyer. Since the service upon the petitioner was invalid, the period to file a motion for reconsideration did not commence from the date of its receipt.

The petition is **GRANTED**. The writ of execution is annulled and set aside.
