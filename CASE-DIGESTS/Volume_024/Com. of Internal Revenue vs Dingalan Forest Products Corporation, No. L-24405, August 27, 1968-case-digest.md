**I. CAPTION**
**COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. DINGALAN FOREST PRODUCTS CORPORATION and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS**, G.R. No. L-24405, August 27, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
Dingalan Forest Products Corporation, a forest concessionaire, cut and removed forest products from its concession and paid the corresponding forest charges [1]. It subsequently sold these products to customers and paid P48,767.73 in percentage or sales taxes to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) [2]. Dingalan requested a refund, which the CIR denied. On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ordered a refund of P45,673.95 [3]. The CTA relied on the ruling in *Collector of Internal Revenue v. Pio Barretto & Sons* (1960), reasoning that forest charges are payments for timber sold by the Government to the concessionaire; thus, the "original sale" is the transfer from the Government to the concessionaire, and the subsequent sale by Dingalan to its customers was not subject to sales tax [3]. The CIR petitioned the Supreme Court to review the CTA decision [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the sales of forest products made by the concessionaire to its customers are considered "original sales" subject to percentage tax.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court reversed the CTA decision. The doctrine in *Pio Barretto*—that the Government "sells" timber to concessionaires—was explicitly revoked in *Cordero v. Conda* (1966) and *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Guerrero* (1967) [5]. Forest charges are internal revenue taxes, specifically taxes upon the privilege of cutting and carting away timber, and are not prices for a sale of timber by the Government [5]. Since the Government does not sell the forest products, the "original sale" contemplated in Section 189 of the Internal Revenue Code is the sale made by the concessionaire (Dingalan) to its customers [6]. Consequently, Dingalan is liable for the percentage tax on those sales.

The petition is granted, and the decision appealed from is **REVERSED**. The case is dismissed with costs against the respondent.
