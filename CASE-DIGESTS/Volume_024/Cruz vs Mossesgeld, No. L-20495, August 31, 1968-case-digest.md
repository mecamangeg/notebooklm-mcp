I. CAPTION
BELEN CRUZ v. LUIS M. SIMON DOMINGO MOSSESGELD, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20495, August 31, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On September 25, 1961, Belen Cruz (plaintiff-appellant) filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 3738) against Luis Mossesgeld, Spouses Salamanca, the Philippine National Bank (PNB), and Spouses Concepcion/Perez for the annulment of sale and titles regarding four lots in Cabanatuan City [1, 2]. Cruz alleged she purchased the lots in 1949, but Mossesgeld fraudulently sold them in 1955 to Raquel Salamanca, who later mortgaged them to PNB and sold portions to Angela Concepcion in 1961 [1, 3].

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of *res judicata* [4]. They pointed out that Cruz had previously filed Civil Case No. 2773 in 1958 against the same parties (excluding the Concepcions) involving the same subject matter [4]. That prior case was dismissed on February 10, 1961, for "failure of the parties to prosecute," and the order did not state that the dismissal was without prejudice [5]. The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissed the current complaint, sustaining the motion [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the prior case for failure to prosecute constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The dismissal of the prior case constitutes *res judicata* and bars the present action.

The Supreme Court ruled that a dismissal of a complaint for failure to prosecute, without any reservation by the trial court that the plaintiff has the right to file the complaint anew, acts as a dismissal "with prejudice" and has the effect of an adjudication upon the merits [7]. This is based on Section 3, Rule 30 of the old Rules of Court (now Section 3, Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Court) [7].

The Court found all elements of *res judicata* present: (a) there was a final judgment in the prior case; (b) the court had jurisdiction; (c) the judgment was on the merits; and (d) there was identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action [8, 9]. The addition of Spouses Concepcion/Perez as defendants in the new case did not negate the identity of parties, as they merely "stepped into the shoes" of the original defendant (Salamanca) as successors-in-interest after the judgment in the first case had become final [9].

The orders of the lower court are affirmed [10].
