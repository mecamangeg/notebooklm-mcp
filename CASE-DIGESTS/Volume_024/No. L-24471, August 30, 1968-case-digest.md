I. CAPTION
SILVERIO MARCHAN and PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS CO., INC. v. ARSENIO MENDOZA, LEONARDA ILAYA, and ZENAIDA MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-24471, August 30, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On February 22, 1954, at around 9:00 PM, respondents Arsenio Mendoza, his wife, and child boarded a Philippine Rabbit bus driven by petitioner Silverio Marchan in Malanday, Polo, Bulacan, bound for Manila [1], [2]. Marchan drove at a high speed and ignored a passenger's request to slow down. While attempting to overtake a parked truck to avoid an incoming vehicle, the bus skidded and fell into a ditch [2]. The accident caused multiple injuries to the respondents; Arsenio Mendoza suffered the most serious injuries, resulting in the permanent paralysis of his lower extremities [1]. Marchan was convicted of physical injuries through reckless imprudence in a criminal case [1]. Subsequently, respondents filed a civil suit for damages based on breach of contract of carriage and criminal negligence [1]. The trial court awarded P40,000.00 in compensatory damages, which the Court of Appeals affirmed, adding P30,000.00 in exemplary damages and P5,000.00 in attorney's fees [3]. Petitioners appealed, arguing there was no implied contract of carriage and questioning the award of damages [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the common carrier is liable for the injuries caused by its driver's negligence even if the driver allegedly acted beyond the scope of his authority.
2. W/N the award of P40,000.00 as compensatory damages is proper.
3. W/N the Court of Appeals erred in awarding exemplary damages even though they were not expressly prayed for in the complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that common carriers cannot escape responsibility for the death of or injuries to passengers through the negligence or willful acts of their employees, even if such employees acted beyond the scope of their authority or in violation of orders [4]. Under Article 1759 of the Civil Code, the liability of the carrier is "direct and immediate," not merely subsidiary [4]. Since it was undisputed that Marchan was at the steering wheel, the riding public is not expected to inquire into his authority before boarding [4].

2. **YES.** The Court found the award reasonable considering Arsenio Mendoza was only in his middle twenties when he lost the use of his limbs [5]. He was condemned to be a paralytic for the remainder of his life, leading a "maimed, well-nigh useless existence" [5]. The amount was within the discretion of the Court of Appeals, taking into account his age, expected life span, and earning capacity [5].

3. **YES.** Exemplary damages may be imposed by way of example or correction in addition to compensatory damages, depending on the discretion of the court [6]. They need not be proved or expressly pleaded because they are incidental to and dependent upon the award of compensatory damages [6]. The respondents' prayer for "such other relief and remedies that may be availed of" was sufficient to call upon the court's discretion to award punitive damages [7].

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION**, imposing legal interest on the compensatory and exemplary damages and attorney's fees [8], [9].
