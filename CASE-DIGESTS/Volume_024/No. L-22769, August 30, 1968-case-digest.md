I. CAPTION
JUAN ISBERTO v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Bureau of Public Highways) and WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-22769, August 30, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juan Isberto was employed as a Building Foreman in the District Engineer's Office of Pangasinan. He entered the service in 1951 in perfect health but began feeling back pains in September 1957 [1, 2]. His work required continuous traveling and hiking to supervise projects in different municipalities, exposing him to dust, dirt, and the elements, and causing him to miss meals [3, 4]. He was diagnosed with "Tuberculosis of the bones" or "Pott's disease" and went on sick leave from December 1957 to April 1958 [5, 6]. He filed a claim for compensation, which the Hearing Officer granted, awarding him P5,250.00 [6, 7]. However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) reversed the decision, denying the claim [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner's illness (Pott's disease) is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
2. W/N the respondent's failure to controvert the claim bars them from contesting the compensability.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the illness is compensable. Time and again, it has been established that once a disease is shown to have arisen in the course of employment, the law presumes it arose out of it (*Justiniano v. WCC*) [2]. The law does not require employment to be the sole factor in the growth or development of the illness; it is sufficient if the employment contributed, even in a small degree, to the development or acceleration of the disease (*Manila Railroad Co. v. Pineda*) [8]. Here, the petitioner's work exposed him to the elements and physical strain, which contributed to his condition [4].

2. **YES.** The Court ruled that the respondent failed to comply with Sections 37 and 45 of Act 3428 regarding the report of sickness and controversion [8]. The petitioner’s immediate supervisor knew of the illness and even visited him, yet the respondent failed to file a notice of controversion within the prescribed period. Consequently, the respondent waived its right to contest the claim [8, 9].

The decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission is **SET ASIDE**, and the respondent is ordered to pay the petitioner the sum of P5,250.00 [10].
