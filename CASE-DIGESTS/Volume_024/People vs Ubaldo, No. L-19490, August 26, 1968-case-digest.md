I. CAPTION
**PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. GORGONIO UBALDO, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-19490, August 26, 1968, Per Curiam.

II. FACTS
On April 24, 1958, in Tunga, Leyte, the accused (appellants Valentin Superable, Severo Caigoy, Vicente Calabia, Antonio Pacli, Crispin Villablanca, Jr., and Benjamin Pacli, along with others who later died or turned state witness) gathered at the house of Antonio Pacli. There, they planned to rob the store of Eng Wan and Antonio Pacli distributed firearms to the group. Upon arriving at the store that evening, they divided into three groups: one group entered the store to ransack it, while the others, including Superable, Villablanca, Calabia, and the Pacli brothers, positioned themselves as armed lookouts at nearby road corners.

During the robbery, the entry group took cash and jewelry. Policeman Margarito Cotoner, who entered the store, and Co Cui Hui, a Chinese woman, were shot and killed by the robbers. Another policeman, Marcial Glore, was shot and wounded by Superable while responding to the scene. The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted the accused of robbery in band with double homicide, frustrated homicide, less serious physical injuries, and direct assault, sentencing them to death. The accused appealed, relying primarily on the defense of alibi, claiming they were elsewhere (e.g., at work, at a party, or asleep) when the crime occurred.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defense of alibi can prevail over the positive identification of the accused.
2. W/N a conspiracy existed among the accused.
3. W/N all the accused are liable for the killings committed during the robbery, even those who acted only as lookouts.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and must be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses [1]. The alibis provided by the accused were supported only by relatives or friends and could not overcome the positive identification by the state witness (a co-conspirator) and the victims, specifically the surviving policeman and the store owner's brother [2], [3], [4].

2. **YES.** The precision characterizing the movements of the accused—meeting beforehand to plan, distributing arms, and dividing into specific groups for entry and lookout duties—strongly suggested a unity of purpose and design to expeditiously consummate the crime [5], [6].

3. **YES.** Where conspiracy is established, it is not necessary to pinpoint specifically who fired the fatal shots. All conspirators are liable for the acts of the others, irrespective of the fact that some limited themselves to robbery while others committed homicide [5]. The crime committed was robbery in band with double homicide. Under Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the penalty for members of a band is the maximum penalty (Death) even without the concurrence of aggravating circumstances [7], [8].

**Disposition:** The decision is AFFIRMED regarding the Death penalty for Valentin Superable, Severo Caigoy, Antonio Pacli, and Benjamin Pacli. The sentence is MODIFIED to *Reclusion Perpetua* for Vicente Calabia and Crispin Villablanca, Jr. due to the lack of necessary votes to impose the death penalty [9], [10].
