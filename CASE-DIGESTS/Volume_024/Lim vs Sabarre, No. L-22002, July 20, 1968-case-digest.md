I. CAPTION
CANUTO A. LIM, ET AL. v. TOMAS V. SABARRE, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22002, July 20, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Canuto A. Lim and Lorenza Alcoy (boat owners) and their crew were charged in the Justice of the Peace Court of Calbiga, Samar with violating Municipal Ordinance No. 20, which prohibited trawl fishing. Petitioners filed a Motion to Quash, arguing the ordinance was void because it had been disapproved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Respondent Justice of the Peace Tomas V. Sabarre denied the motion and set the case for trial.

Petitioners then filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Samar to restrain the trial and annul the ordinance. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling that the Justice of the Peace had jurisdiction to hear the case and that petitioners had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy via appeal from a judgment of conviction.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the denial of the motion to quash is a proper subject for a writ of prohibition or mandamus.

IV. RULING
**NO.** A writ of prohibition will not issue unless the respondent acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion; mandamus applies only to exact compliance with a clear legal duty [1]. The Supreme Court held that prohibition is not the proper remedy to review an order denying a motion to quash [1]. The sound general practice is to deny the motion or defer resolution until decision on the merits, unless the grounds are indubitable [2].

Here, the ground relied upon was not indubitable. Under Section 4 of Act No. 4003, ordinances have full force unless notice of disapproval is communicated to the municipal council within 30 days [3]. Petitioners failed to allege or prove when the ordinance was submitted or that the disapproval was communicated to the council; respondents explicitly averred no notice was received [3]. Thus, Respondent Sabarre did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion [4].

The Order of the CFI dismissing the complaint is affirmed [5].
