I. CAPTION
VICENTE S. DEL ROSARIO, CEFERINA LLAMAS VDA. DE DEL ROSARIO, TERESITA REYES and DIOSDADO LARRAZABAL v. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and THE PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), G.R. No. L-23133, July 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On July 13, 1967, the Supreme Court rendered a decision which the petitioners received on July 28, 1967 [1]. On August 22, 1967, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, followed by "Supplemental Arguments in Support of the Motion for Reconsideration" on September 2, 1967, praying that the decision be set aside [1]. The Court issued a resolution on September 8, 1967, denying the reconsideration prayed for in the supplemental arguments [2].

Entry of judgment was made on October 13, 1967 [2]. However, petitioners subsequently filed motions for reconsideration in April and June 1968, arguing that the entry of judgment was premature and void. They claimed their "basic" Motion for Reconsideration filed on August 22 had not yet been resolved, as the Court's September 8 resolution ostensibly only addressed the "Supplemental Arguments" [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the entry of judgment was premature and void on the ground that the basic Motion for Reconsideration remained unresolved.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court found no merit in the contention that the basic Motion for Reconsideration had not been resolved [3, 4]. The Supplemental Arguments filed by petitioners specifically prayed for the setting aside of the July 13, 1967 decision [1, 3]. When the Court issued its Resolution on September 8, 1967, it denied this prayer *inter alia* [2, 3]. Since petitioners' counsel received this denial on October 6, 1967, the decision had clearly become final and executory by the time the entry of judgment was made on October 13, 1967 [3]. Consequently, the subsequent motions for reconsideration could no longer be considered [5].

Motion denied [5].
