I. CAPTION
ROGER CHAVEZ v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES and THE WARDEN OF THE CITY JAIL OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-29169, August 19, 1968, 133 Phil. 661, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Roger Chavez was charged with qualified theft of a motor vehicle along with several co-accused. During the trial on July 23, 1963, the fiscal called Chavez as the first witness for the prosecution. Chavez's counsel objected, invoking the constitutional right against self-incrimination and stating the accused would not testify. The trial judge overruled the objection, ruling that the prosecution had the right to call the accused as a witness and that counsel could only object to specific incriminating questions. Under this compulsion, Chavez took the stand and gave testimony that the court later relied upon to convict him as a "self-confessed culprit."

Chavez appealed to the Court of Appeals, but the appeal was dismissed for failure to file a brief, making the judgment final. He was subsequently arrested and confined. Chavez then filed this petition for habeas corpus, arguing that the judgment of conviction was void because his constitutional right against self-incrimination was violated.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court violated the petitioner's right against self-incrimination by compelling him to testify as a prosecution witness.
2. W/N the writ of habeas corpus is available to annul a final judgment of conviction based on a violation of a constitutional right.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that compelling an accused to testify as a witness for the prosecution violates the constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination (Art. III, Sec. 1, No. 18, Philippine Constitution; now Art. III, Sec. 17, 1987 Constitution) and Rule 115 of the Rules of Court. The Court distinguished an accused from an ordinary witness: while an ordinary witness must take the stand and claim the privilege only when an incriminating question is asked, an accused may refuse to take the witness stand altogether. The Court held that the trial judge's directive effectively coerced the petitioner, and his subsequent testimony could not be deemed a waiver of the privilege because it was not voluntary.

2. **YES.** The Court held that a violation of the accused's fundamental constitutional right deprives the trial court of jurisdiction, rendering the subsequent judgment of conviction void. A void judgment is a nullity and may be challenged by collateral attack, such as through a petition for habeas corpus, even if the judgment has arguably become final. The writ of habeas corpus extends to all cases of illegal confinement where the detention is under a void judgment.

The petition was **GRANTED**, and the Warden was ordered to discharge Roger Chavez from custody unless held for another cause.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
**Castro, J. (Separate Opinion):**
Concurred with the ruling, emphasizing that the privilege against self-incrimination is a fundamental landmark in the struggle for human dignity. He noted that the trial court's action recreated the horrors of the Star Chamber. He cited *Fay v. Noia*, arguing that *habeas corpus* is the historic remedy to vindicate due process and provide redress for unconstitutional convictions, regardless of procedural defaults like failure to appeal.
