I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK v. TERESITA OSETE, JOSE CRESPO and ESTELITA CUYA, G.R. No. L-24997, July 18, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On January 30, 1963, petitioner Philippine National Bank (PNB) filed an action in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover a sum of money based on a judgment rendered on January 8, 1953 against respondents Teresita Osete, Jose Crespo, and Estelita Cuya [1]. The 1953 judgment had become final and executory on January 23, 1953 [2]. Crespo and Cuya pleaded prescription, but the Municipal Court ruled in favor of PNB [1].

Crespo appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila [3]. In the CFI, PNB sought to file an amended complaint alleging for the first time that the prescriptive period was interrupted by written demands and partial payments [3, 4]. The CFI denied the admission of the amended complaint and dismissed the case on the ground of prescription, as more than 10 years had elapsed since the judgment became final [2, 3]. PNB appealed, arguing that Article 1155 of the Civil Code regarding interruption of prescription should apply [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the action to enforce the judgment has prescribed.
2. W/N Article 1155 of the Civil Code, regarding interruption of prescription by written demand or acknowledgment, applies to actions to enforce or revive a judgment.
3. W/N the CFI erred in denying the admission of the amended complaint.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The action was commenced on January 30, 1963, which is more than ten years after the judgment became final and executory on January 23, 1953 [2]. Therefore, the action to enforce the judgment is barred by the statute of limitations.

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that Article 1155 of the New Civil Code refers to the tolling of the period of prescription of the *action to collect*, not to the *action to enforce or revive a judgment* [6, 7]. The Court reasoned that an extrajudicial demand indicates a creditor has not slept on their rights in an ordinary collection suit, but such demand is unnecessary for a judgment which is enforced by a writ of execution [7]. Furthermore, the alleged written demands were addressed to Cuya, not the appellant Crespo, and thus could not toll prescription as regards him [8].

3. **NO.** The CFI properly denied the amendment because it would substantially change the nature of the issue between the parties on appeal [9]. In the Municipal Court, the issue was merely the lapse of the 10-year period; the amended complaint sought to introduce a new issue regarding the *interruption* of that period based on facts (partial payments) not alleged in the lower court [9].

The order appealed from is affirmed [10].
