I. CAPTION
SURIGAO ELECTRIC CO., INC. and ARTURO LUMANLAN, SR. v. MUNICIPALITY OF SURIGAO and HON. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-22766, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 89, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Surigao Electric Co., Inc., a legislative franchise holder for an electric plant, transferred its rights to petitioner Arturo Lumanlan. Congress enacted Republic Act No. 2677 on June 18, 1960, amending the Public Service Act to exempt "government entities" from the requirement of obtaining a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate public services, though they remained subject to rate regulation [1].

The Municipality of Surigao submitted a tentative schedule of rates to the Public Service Commission (PSC) to maintain and operate an electric plant. On July 11, 1963, the PSC approved the rates, ruling that the municipality is a "government entity" under R.A. 2677 and thus did not need a CPC [2, 3]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that a municipality is not a government entity under the specific statute and that their legislative franchise rights were violated by the entry of the municipality as a competitor [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a municipality is considered a "government entity" exempt from obtaining a Certificate of Public Convenience under Republic Act No. 2677.
2. W/N the petitioner's legislative franchise precludes the municipality from operating a competing electric plant.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that a municipal corporation has a dual character: one governmental, acting as a branch of the state, and the other corporate or quasi-private [6]. Citing *Mendoza v. De Leon*, the Court emphasized that governmental affairs do not lose their character when delegated to municipal governments. To interpret "government entities" in R.A. 2677 as excluding municipalities would erode the law's meaning and intent. This interpretation aligns with the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264), which aimed to enlarge municipal power [7]. Thus, the Municipality of Surigao is an instrumentality of the National Government and is exempt from the CPC requirement [3, 4].

2. **NO.** A legislative franchise is not exclusive and cannot override the Constitution. Under Article XIV, Section 8 of the 1935 Constitution, no franchise shall be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by Congress [5]. This amendment may be implied from a later act of general applicability like R.A. 2677. Furthermore, relying on the American doctrine in *Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge*, the Court ruled that a franchise cannot defeat the proper exercise of police power [8]. The government cannot be disarmed of powers necessary to accomplish its ends, such as promoting community welfare by operating public services [9].

The orders of the Public Service Commission are **AFFIRMED** [10].
