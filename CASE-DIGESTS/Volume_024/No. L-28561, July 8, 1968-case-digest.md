I. CAPTION
BARNEY FRENCH v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS and TOMAS BAYAN, G.R. No. L-28561, July 8, 1968, 24 SCRA 23, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In the November 14, 1967 elections for Mayor of Polomolok, Southern Cotabato, petitioner Barney French (NP) and respondent Tomas Bayan (reelectionist) were candidates [1]. On November 27, 1967, the Board of Canvassers proclaimed French as Mayor, but on November 30, the original board reconvened without COMELEC supervision and proclaimed Bayan [2, 3]. The COMELEC annulled both proclamations and ordered a recanvass using the Municipal Treasurer's copies of the returns [4].

During the recanvass on January 2, 1968, anomalies were discovered: keys were not in the proper custody, a seal was missing, and the ballot box pin was loose [5, 6]. Crucially, the Treasurer's copies for Precincts 9, 10, and 11 showed an increased number of votes for Bayan compared to the COMELEC's copies, a discrepancy that did not exist during the first canvass [5, 7]. Despite these findings, the COMELEC issued resolutions on January 11 and 23, 1968, ordering the canvass to resume and stating that if discrepancies existed, the parties should seek "judicial relief" (judicial recount) [8, 9]. French filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the returns were tampered with and COMELEC copies should be used [10].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a judicial recount is the proper remedy when election returns have been tampered with after leaving the hands of the election inspectors.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion. The record conclusively showed that the discrepancies were not *bona fide* but the result of tampering committed *after* the first canvass to falsify the results in favor of Bayan [7, 11].

Citing *Espino v. Zaldivar* and *Ong v. Commission on Elections*, the Court ruled that the remedy of judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code applies only when differences result from contradictions among different returns as prepared and signed by the inspectors [12, 13]. It cannot be invoked where returns are tampered with after leaving the inspectors' hands, because "a falsified return or spurious return amounts to no return at all" [12, 14]. When the COMELEC finds patent tampering, it must strike down the fraudulent returns and order the canvass based on authentic copies—in this case, the COMELEC's own copies [9, 15].

**Petition GRANTED.** The COMELEC resolutions are set aside, and the Commission is ordered to direct the resumption of the canvass using the Commission on Elections' copies of the returns [16].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
None. (Concepcion, C.J., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles, JJ., concurred. Fernando, J., did not take part) [17].
