I. CAPTION
PROCESO VINLUAN, petitioner, vs. THE HON. JUSTICES OF THE COURT OF APPEALS — EDMUNDO S. PICCIO, ANTONIO CAÑIZARES and HERMOGENES CONCEPCION, JR. and JOSEFINA RAMOS, respondents., G.R. No. L-25029, August 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Josefina Ramos filed a complaint for legal separation and separation of property against her husband, petitioner Proceso Vinluan, in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan [1]. Pending the case, Ramos filed a petition for alimony *pendente lite* for herself and their five children [1]. Judge Eloy B. Bello denied the motion, ruling that it was premature to grant alimony since legal separation had not yet been decreed [2]. Ramos filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA) [2]. The CA granted the writ and ordered Vinluan to pay P1,000.00 monthly alimony [2]. Vinluan filed this petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing that Ramos had a remedy by appeal and that the amount was excessive [3]. During the pendency of this case, Vinluan died [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a petition for certiorari is the proper remedy against an order denying alimony *pendente lite*.
2. W/N the award of P1,000.00 monthly alimony was excessive.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The order denying a petition for alimony *pendente lite* is interlocutory [3, 5, 6]. While the plaintiff could have sought a review of the order by appeal, she would have had to wait until the rendition of the judgment on the merits [3, 5, 6]. Since judgment might not be forthcoming for months or years, and the plaintiff and her children needed immediate support, an appeal would not have been a speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law [3, 5, 6].

2. **YES.** The aggregate annual income of the conjugal properties was only P3,000.00, and Ramos merely prayed for a monthly allowance of P200.00 [4, 7, 8]. Therefore, the CA's award of P1,000.00 monthly is clearly excessive [4, 7, 8]. However, the petitioner's death mooted the case and the main action for legal separation [4].

Case dismissed [4].
