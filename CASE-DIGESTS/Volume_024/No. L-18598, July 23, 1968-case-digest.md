I. CAPTION
TAN GUAN v. HONS. MARIANO NABLE, AUGUSTO M. LUCIANO, ROMAN M. UMALI, JOSE ARAÑAS or COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. L-18598, July 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Tan Guan was a partner in Imperial Tobacco Company ("Imperial"), which was dissolved in 1951. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued two assessments against Imperial for specific taxes on cigarettes. The first assessment for P72,450 was made on January 21, 1953, based on 300 bobbins of cigarette paper Imperial allegedly sold to a fictitious entity, "Marikina Cigarette Factory." On February 9, 1953, Imperial's representative appealed this assessment to the CIR's conference staff. The CIR reiterated the demand on May 8, 1953. The second assessment for P128,800 was issued on March 20, 1958, covering 800 bobbins Imperial denied receiving but which were proven delivered by the seller. The government filed a civil action to collect these amounts on May 7, 1958. Tan Guan challenged the assessments before the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing that the action to collect the first assessment had prescribed (exceeding 5 years from January 21, 1953, to May 7, 1958) and questioning the factual basis of the tax liability. The CTA upheld the assessments.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the government's right to collect the P72,450 assessment has prescribed.
2. W/N the validity of the Revenue Regulation relied upon by the CIR can be raised for the first time on appeal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The action has not prescribed. The Court held that the running of the prescriptive period was interrupted on February 9, 1953, when the disputed assessment was appealed to the conference staff. The Commissioner reiterated the demand on May 8, 1953. Consequently, from May 8, 1953, to the commencement of the civil action on May 7, 1958, less than five years had elapsed [1, 2]. Furthermore, the Court noted that the five-year prescriptive period applies only when a return is filed. Since Imperial did not file a return, the applicable prescriptive period is ten years pursuant to Section 332(a) of the Tax Code [3, 4].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the validity of Section 10 of Revenue Regulations No. V-7 cannot be assailed for the first time on appeal. This issue was not raised in the Court of Tax Appeals and therefore cannot be entertained by the Supreme Court [3, 5]. Regarding the factual questions, the Court affirmed the CTA's findings that the sale to "Marikina" was fictitious and that the receipt of the 800 bobbins was supported by substantial evidence [6, 7].

The petition was denied, and the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals was affirmed [5].
