I. CAPTION
ANTONIO MA. CUI and MERCEDES CUI DE RAMAS v. COURT OF APPEALS and JOSE MA. CUI, G.R. No. L-24072, July 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Antonio Ma. Cui and Mercedes Cui de Ramas co-owned three lots in Cebu City with their father, Don Mariano Cui. In 1947, they executed an agreement assigning 900 square meters of Lot No. 2319 to Don Mariano. Don Mariano collected rentals from a building occupied by Lim brothers on the lot. Meanwhile, petitioners collected rentals from a 69-square-meter portion of the same lot leased to Marcelino Godinez.

In 1960, during the intestate proceedings for Don Mariano, respondent Jose Ma. Cui filed a motion to compel petitioners to turn over to the estate the rentals they collected from Godinez from 1947 to 1959, totaling P21,300. The Court of First Instance (CFI) denied the motion, ruling that the parties had agreed in open court that rentals from the 69-square-meter portion would only accrue to the estate starting August 1960. Jose Cui appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA did not decide the merits but ordered the case remanded to the CFI to identify and delimit the 69-square-meter and 100-square-meter portions of the lot and for accounting. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the remand was erroneous.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case to the lower court for further proceedings instead of deciding the case on the merits.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that the order of remand was premature and unnecessary. The Court of Appeals failed to resolve the pivotal issues raised on appeal: (1) whether the parties effectively agreed that the disputed rentals prior to August 1960 belonged to petitioners, and (2) whether the 1947 agreement limited Don Mariano’s share to the area occupied by the Lim building, thereby excluding the 69-square-meter portion. If either were true, the lower court’s denial of the motion to turn over rentals would be correct.

Furthermore, the CA’s directive to delimit the respective lots was unnecessary because the record showed no disagreement between the parties regarding the identity and location of the 69-square-meter lot assigned to the estate and the 100-square-meter lot assigned to petitioners. Citing *De la Cruz v. Sosing*, the Court reiterated that while CA factual findings are usually binding, the Supreme Court retains the power to rectify findings plainly premised on a misapprehension of fact. The petition was granted, the CA decision was set aside, and the records were remanded to the Court of Appeals for a decision on the merits.
