I. CAPTION
ALFONSO LACSON v. CARMEN SAN JOSE-LACSON and THE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-23482, L-23767, and L-24259, August 30, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Alfonso Lacson and Carmen San Jose-Lacson were married in 1953 and had four children. In January 1963, Carmen left the conjugal home in Bacolod to reside in Manila. She initially filed a complaint for custody and support in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (JDRC) [1]. However, the parties subsequently reached an amicable settlement and filed a joint petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental for the dissolution of their conjugal partnership and separation of property [2].

The compromise agreement provided for the separation of property and stipulated that the custody of the two elder children (then under seven years old) would go to Alfonso, while the two younger children would remain with Carmen [3]. The CFI approved this agreement in a judgment [4]. Carmen later sought to be relieved of the custody agreement, arguing she signed it only to gain immediate custody of the younger children, and sought custody of all four. The JDRC dismissed her case on grounds of *res judicata* and *lis pendens* due to the CFI judgment [5]. The CFI ordered the execution of the compromise judgment regarding custody [6]. On certiorari, the Court of Appeals (CA) declared the compromise judgment null and void insofar as it awarded custody of the two children under seven to the father [7].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the compromise agreement regarding the dissolution of the conjugal partnership and separation of property is valid.
2. W/N the compromise agreement awarding custody of children under seven years of age to the father is valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The compromise agreement regarding property is valid. The Civil Code allows for the separation of property and dissolution of the conjugal partnership through a compromise agreement, provided judicial sanction is secured beforehand [8]. Article 191 explicitly permits the husband and wife to agree upon the dissolution of the conjugal partnership subject to judicial approval [9]. Since the spouses obtained judicial approval and no creditors were prejudiced, the arrangement is valid, especially considering the spouses had been separated in fact [10].

2. **NO.** The agreement awarding custody of children under seven years old to the father is void. Article 363 of the Civil Code mandatorily provides that "No mother shall be separated from her child under seven years of age, unless the court finds compelling reasons for such measure" [11]. This provision is grounded in the rationale that a mother should not be deprived of a child of tender age [12]. The Court held that the compromise agreement violated this mandatory law and failed to present any "compelling reason" to justify separating the mother from her children under seven [13]. Furthermore, the welfare of the child should not depend solely on the parents' agreement; the court must hear evidence to determine custody in the child's best interest [14].

ACCORDINGLY, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the Court of First Instance for further proceedings [15].
