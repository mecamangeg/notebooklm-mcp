I. CAPTION
THE CITY OF NAGA v. COURT OF APPEALS and SAN MIGUEL BREWERY, G.R. No. L-24954, August 14, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 15, 1954, the Municipal Board of Naga City enacted Ordinance No. 141, imposing a "municipal tax" of 1/48 of a centavo for every bottle of beverage corked or capped by establishments within the city [1, 2]. San Miguel Brewery (SMB), which operates a plant in Naga, paid this tax. Subsequently, following the enactment of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264), the city passed Ordinance No. 234 in 1961, imposing a tax on SMB's business based on its corking machine capacity [1, 3]. SMB claimed it was being subjected to double taxation and filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to annul Ordinance No. 141 and refund payments made [3, 4]. The CFI ruled in favor of SMB, declaring Ordinance No. 141 inapplicable and ordering a refund of amounts paid under protest [5]. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, relying on the doctrine in *Medina v. City of Baguio* [6]. The City of Naga petitioned for review, arguing that Ordinance No. 141 was valid under Section 15(kk) of its Charter (R.A. No. 305), which empowers it to "regulate" businesses and impose "license fees" [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Ordinance No. 141 is valid under the City's charter authority to "regulate" businesses and impose license fees.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the authority to "regulate" and "impose a license fee" under Section 15(kk) of the City Charter involves the grant of **police power**, which is the authority to enact rules for the promotion of the general welfare [7]. This is distinct from the power of **taxation**, the purpose of which is to raise funds for the general operation of the government [7]. Ordinance No. 141 acts as a tax on specific articles, which the city was not authorized to impose under its charter or the law in force at the time of the ordinance's enactment in 1954 [7, 8]. The subsequent approval of the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. No. 2264) in 1959 did not cure the infirmity of the ordinance because the Act does not have retroactive effect [8]. The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed [9].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
None. (Sanchez, J., took no part) [9].
