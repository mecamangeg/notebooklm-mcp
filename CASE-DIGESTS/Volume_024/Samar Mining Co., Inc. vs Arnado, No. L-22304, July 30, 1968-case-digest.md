I. CAPTION
SAMAR MINING CO., INC. v. FRANCISCO P. ARNADO, POMPEYO V. TAN and RUFINO ABUYEN, G.R. No. L-22304, July 30, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Rufino Abuyen, a foreman for Samar Mining Co., Inc., filed a claim for workman's compensation in 1956 for tuberculosis contracted during employment. In 1958, Pompeyo V. Tan, a Labor Attorney in Regional Office No. VI of the Department of Labor, rendered a decision ordering the company to pay Abuyen compensation and medical expenses.

Samar Mining challenged the decision, first in the CFI of Manila (dismissed for wrong venue), and subsequently in the CFI of Cebu via a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The company argued that Tan, being a Labor Attorney and not a regularly appointed Hearing Officer, lacked jurisdiction to decide the claim, and that Regional Administrator Francisco Arnado could not delegate such authority.

During the proceedings in CFI Cebu, the court reopened the case after the submission of memoranda to admit "Exhibit 1," an office order showing Arnado had explicitly designated Tan as the Hearing Officer for Abuyen's case. The CFI dismissed the petition, ruling Tan had authority. Samar Mining appealed, questioning the validity of the designation and the lower court's reopening of the case.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Regional Administrator may validly designate a Labor Attorney to act as a Hearing Officer to decide a controverted workman's compensation claim.
2. W/N the trial court abused its discretion in reopening the case to receive evidence of such designation.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Plan No. 20-A and Executive Order No. 218, as well as Rule 21 of the Rules of Procedure of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, a Regional Administrator has the authority to designate an employee, such as a Labor Attorney, to act as a Hearing Officer. The Supreme Court held that while controverted claims are generally heard by regularly appointed Hearing Officers, they may also be heard by "any other employee duly designated by the Regional Administrator to act as hearing officer" [1]. The record established that Respondent Tan was a qualified member of the Bar and was duly designated by Regional Administrator Arnado via an office order to try the specific case of Abuyen [2].

2. **NO.** Trial courts possess the discretionary power to reopen a case, either before or after the rendition of judgment, to introduce additional evidence to dispel doubts on material points. This power is controlled only by the paramount interest of justice [3]. The Supreme Court found no abuse of discretion, noting that the reopening clarified the material issue of Tan's designation.

The Court affirmed the lower court's decision and, noting that the petitioner used the litigation to delay compensation to a poor tuberculosis patient for twelve years, assessed treble costs jointly and severally against the petitioner and its counsel [4, 5].
