I. CAPTION
Adela Ongsiaco Vda. de Clemeña v. Agustin Engracio Clemeña, et al., G.R. No. L-24845, August 22, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Adela Ongsiaco Vda. de Clemeña, the surviving spouse and administratrix of the estate of the late Engracio Clemeña, filed a petition for the settlement of his estate. Respondent Agustin Engracio Clemeña opposed the petition, claiming to be the decedent's illegitimate (not natural) child [1, 2]. Adela objected to Agustin's intervention, arguing that he had no legal interest because he was not recognized by the decedent. She contended that Agustin's action to establish illegitimate paternity was barred since he was already past the age of majority (born in 1928, over 36 years old) when the alleged father died in 1964 [2]. The trial court overruled the objection and allowed Agustin to present evidence of filiation, citing the absence of settled jurisprudence on whether illegitimate (not natural) paternity may be investigated after the death of the alleged parent [3]. Adela filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N an illegitimate (not natural) child may bring an action to establish paternity after the death of the alleged father, when the claimant was already of age at the time of the father's death.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the action to establish paternity of illegitimate children who are not natural (spurious children) is subject to the same limitations prescribed by Article 285 of the Civil Code for natural children [5].

Under Article 285, the action for recognition of natural children may be brought only during the lifetime of the presumed parents, unless the parent died during the claimant's minority or a previously unknown recognition document is discovered [6]. Although the Civil Code is silent on the duration of the action for illegitimate (not natural) children, the Court applied the same time limit for the following reasons:
1.  **Identity of Action:** Both actions seek to establish a generative link. Since the nature and basis are identical, the same time limit should apply [7].
2.  **Fairness and Justice:** The alleged parent should have a personal opportunity to be heard. Allowing post-mortem suits facilitates blackmail and scandal against the legitimate family, who cannot explain circumstances known only to the deceased [8-10].
3.  **Gradation of Rights:** The Civil Code grants the greatest rights to legitimate children and fewer rights to illegitimate ones. It would be illogical to allow spurious children (who have fewer rights than natural children) to bring actions anytime during their lifetime (like legitimates under Art. 268), while natural children are limited to the parent's lifetime [11-13].

The ruling of the trial court was set aside, and the respondent was declared without legal interest in the estate [14].
