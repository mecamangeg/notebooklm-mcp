I. CAPTION
MAXIMA C. LOPEZ v. MANUEL B. CASACLANG, Adm. Case No. 549, August 26, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Maxima Lopez charged respondent Atty. Manuel Casaclang with malpractice on three counts. First, Lopez alleged Casaclang improperly notarized a deed transferring her rights over a PHHC lot to Casaclang’s parents in the absence of the signatories (Lopez and her witnesses), although she admitted the signatures were genuine [1, 2]. Second, Casaclang allegedly notarized a falsified general power of attorney purportedly executed by one Teofila Banigued; the signature "Teofila Banigued" was actually written by Teofila’s aunt, Alejandra, with Teofila’s consent because Teofila was ill, but the document did not disclose this agency [3, 4]. Third, Casaclang allegedly prepared an affidavit containing a false birth date for Lopez's daughter; however, Casaclang proved the data was supplied by Lopez herself [5]. The Solicitor General investigated and recommended dismissal of charges but with an admonition [2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the respondent is guilty of culpable malpractice warranting disbarment or suspension for his acts in notarizing the documents.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court held that the penalty of disbarment or suspension is not warranted [4].

Regarding the first count, the Court ruled that mere preponderance of evidence is insufficient to overcome the import of a notary’s certification that a grantor acknowledged a document before him; clear, strong, and convincing evidence is required [6]. Furthermore, citing *Ramirez v. Ner*, the Court held that where signatures are genuine, notarizing a document in the absence of the affiant suggests a "lack of caution" rather than "culpable malpractice," and is not serious enough to warrant disbarment [7, 8].

Regarding the second count, the Court found the respondent guilty only of "laxity and carelessness" for notarizing a power of attorney known to him to have been signed by an agent (Alejandra) for the principal (Teofila) without such fact appearing on the face of the document, even if the authority was verified [4].

Regarding the third count, respondent was not at fault as he relied on the complainant's information [5].

Respondent Manuel B. Casaclang was **REPRIMANDED** and warned to be more careful in the performance of his notarial duties [4].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
