**I. CAPTION**
ARTURO SERIÑA v. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BUKIDNON and ERNESTO VILLALON, G.R. No. L-28511, August 22, 1968.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Arturo Seriña filed an original petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction and mandamus against the Court of First Instance of Bukidnon and private respondent Ernesto Villalon [1]. The case arose from an election dispute involving the application of Sections 142 and 162 of the Election Code [2]. The central controversy concerned whether the lower court could distinguish between material and immaterial omissions regarding compliance with these mandatory statutory provisions [2]. During the proceedings before the Supreme Court, the matter in issue was rendered moot and academic [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the Supreme Court may exercise its supervisory power over the inferior tribunal in this case.
2. W/N courts may distinguish between material and immaterial omissions when applying mandatory provisions of the Election Code.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that where the matter in issue has been rendered moot and academic, there is no occasion for the exercise of the supervisory power of the Supreme Court over inferior tribunals [2, 3].

2. **NO.** The Court held that inferior tribunals must obey the Election Code. When provisions, such as Sections 142 and 162, are couched in mandatory form, no court has the power to distinguish between material and immaterial omissions. "What the law decrees must be obeyed. It is as peremptory and as simple as that" [2, 3]. 

(Note: The specific disposition (e.g., "Petition Dismissed") is not explicitly quoted in the provided sources, but the ruling on mootness implies the petition was not granted on the merits.)
