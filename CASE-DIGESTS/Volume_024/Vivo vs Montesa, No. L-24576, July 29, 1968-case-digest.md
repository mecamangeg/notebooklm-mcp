**I. CAPTION**
**MARTINIANO P. VIVO, as Acting Commissioner of Immigration, et al. v. HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA, as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XIX, JOSE CALACDAY, et al.**, G.R. No. L-24576, July 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
Private respondents (the Calacdays) arrived in the Philippines in 1959 and were admitted as Filipino citizens by the Board of Special Inquiry. In 1963, Isaac Calacday, their alleged father, confessed to immigration officials that they were not his sons, although he later retracted. Based on this, Petitioner Commissioner Vivo issued warrants of arrest against respondents to show cause why they should not be deported for entering via false statements. One respondent was arrested while the others remained at large.

Respondents filed a petition with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to restrain their arrest and deportation, claiming Filipino citizenship. Judge Montesa issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the arrest and detention, and ordered the release of the detained respondent upon filing a bond. Petitioner filed this action for certiorari and prohibition, arguing the lower court lacked jurisdiction to restrain deportation proceedings.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction to restrain the deportation proceedings based on a claim of citizenship.
2. W/N the Commissioner of Immigration has the power to issue warrants of arrest against aliens for the purpose of preliminary investigation.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The proceedings are within the jurisdiction of immigration authorities under Sections 29 and 37 of the Philippine Immigration Act (C.A. No. 613) [1]. This jurisdiction is not divested by a mere claim of citizenship when there is reliable evidence to the contrary [1]. The immigration authorities must be given the opportunity to determine the issue of citizenship before the courts may interfere in the exercise of judicial review [1]. Since the Board of Commissioners had not yet rendered a decision, there was nothing for the courts to review [2].

2. **NO.** The issuance of warrants of arrest by the Commissioner solely for investigation purposes, before a final order of deportation is issued, violates the Bill of Rights [3]. Under the 1935 Constitution, the power to determine probable cause for warrants of arrest is limited exclusively to judges [4]. Administrative arrests are valid only to carry out a *final* order of deportation or to effect compliance with a contempt order, but not for preliminary administrative investigations [5, 6]. To ensure appearance at hearings, a cautionary bond is sufficient [7].

**Disposition:** The writ is GRANTED; the CFI order is SET ASIDE and the proceedings ordered discontinued. However, the warrants of arrest issued by the Commissioner are declared NULL AND VOID, without prejudice to requiring respondents to furnish bonds to guarantee their appearance.
