I. CAPTION
CRESENCIA ANTONEL and ISIDORO DIONISIO v. LAND TENURE ADMINISTRATION now LAND AUTHORITY and LORENZO CABRERA, G.R. No. L-24924, July 31, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Cresencia Antonel and Isidoro Dionisio occupied a 125.7-square-meter lot (Lot 26) of the Nuestra Señora de Guia Estate in Tondo, Manila, since 1939. Under Commonwealth Act (C.A.) 539, which authorized the government to acquire private lands for resale to bona fide tenants, Antonel applied to purchase the lot in 1950. The Director of Lands executed an "Agreement to Sell" in her favor in 1951.

In 1954, respondent Lorenzo Cabrera protested, claiming a preferential right. Although Cabrera occupied an adjacent road-lot, his house protruded 7.8 square meters into Lot 26. The Land Tenure Administration (LTA) eventually modified the Director of Lands' decision, ordering the division of the small lot into two: 68.7 sq.m. for Antonel and 57 sq.m. for Cabrera. The Office of the President affirmed this, citing "equal rights to occupancy." Antonel filed a complaint to annul these orders, but the Court of First Instance dismissed it, ruling that the contract was not final and no law was violated.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Antonel has the exclusive preferential right to purchase the entire lot to the exclusion of Cabrera.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision. Antonel established her preferential right over the entire lot for several reasons: (1) she occupied the lot in 1939, a year ahead of Cabrera’s predecessor; (2) the 1950 sketch plan showed she solely occupied Lot 26 while Cabrera occupied the adjacent road-lot; (3) she paid rentals since 1947, while Cabrera paid none for the disputed lot; and (4) she validly applied for and secured an "Agreement to Sell" years before Cabrera protested.

Furthermore, the Court held that dividing a 125.7-square-meter lot into two smaller portions defeats the purpose of C.A. 539. Citing *Grande v. Santos*, the Court reasoned that a lot of such small area is "barely enough for a single family" and subdividing it would lead to friction and conflict, which the law seeks to avert. The policy of the law is to sell the land to the person whose house stands thereon to afford them a home.

The judgment of the lower court was reversed, the LTA orders and the award to Cabrera were annulled, and Antonel was adjudged entitled to purchase the entire 125.7-square-meter lot.
