I. CAPTION
CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY v. MUNICIPALITY OF NAGA, CEBU, ET AL., G.R. Nos. 24116-17, August 22, 1968, 24 SCRA 708, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Cebu Portland Cement Company was assessed a total of P204,300.00 for municipal license taxes and penalties for the years 1960 and 1961 by respondent Municipality of Naga, Cebu [1]. Upon petitioner's failure to pay despite demands, the Municipal Treasurer exercised the remedy of distraint under Section 2304 of the Revised Administrative Code. On July 6, 1961, the Treasurer notified the petitioner's Plant Manager of the distraint of 100,000 bags of Apo cement and posted a notice of sale scheduled for July 27, 1961 [2-4].

The sale did not proceed on the original date due to petitioner's requests for deferment [5]. On January 16, 1962, the Treasurer informed the petitioner of the re-advertisement of the sale. A new notice was issued on January 19, 1962, fixing the auction for January 30, 1962 [6]. The sale took place on that date. Petitioner filed actions to test the validity of the distraint and the subsequent auction sale. The Court of First Instance of Cebu rendered a joint decision upholding the validity of the municipality's actions [1]. Petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the distraint of the petitioner's property was valid under the Revised Administrative Code.
2. W/N the auction sale was valid regarding the notice period and the date of sale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The distraint was valid. The Court ruled that Section 2304 of the Revised Administrative Code clearly empowers the municipal treasurer to "seize and distrain any personal property" of a person who fails to pay municipal taxes or revenue at the time required [9, 10]. Since petitioner indisputably failed to pay the tax, the Treasurer's power came into play. The Court emphasized that where the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation, only application [10].

2. **YES.** The auction sale was valid. Regarding the notice period, the Court rejected the claim that the sale violated the law for occurring less than twenty days after notice. Computing from the first notice on July 6, 1961, to the sale on January 30, 1962, more than twenty days had elapsed; the delay was attributed to petitioner's own requests for deferment [5]. Regarding the date of sale, the lower court found as a fact that the notice fixed January 30, 1962, and the sale was held on that same day, contrary to petitioner's claim of a discrepancy [6]. Since petitioner appealed directly to the Supreme Court, it is deemed to have waived the right to dispute the lower court's findings of fact [8].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed in toto [11].
