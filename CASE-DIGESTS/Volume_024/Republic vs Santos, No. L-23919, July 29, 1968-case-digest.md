I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. HON. GUILLERMO S. SANTOS and CHUA SIU TING, G.R. No. L-23919, July 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Chua Siu Ting obtained a favorable decision in his naturalization case on September 16, 1961 [1]. On July 8, 1964, he filed a petition for a final hearing preparatory to oath-taking, which respondent Judge Santos granted in an order dated November 4, 1964 [1]. The Solicitor General received the order on November 6, 1964, and filed a notice of appeal and record on appeal within the reglementary period [2]. However, on December 12, 1964, Judge Santos refused to give due course to the appeal, sustaining Chua's verbal opposition that the government failed to file an opposition to the motion for oath-taking [2]. The Republic filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus to compel the judge to allow the appeal [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the government is barred from appealing an order allowing oath-taking due to its failure to file an opposition to the motion for oath-taking.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the mere failure of the government to file an opposition to the motion for oath-taking does not constitute a waiver precluding an appeal [4]. Citizenship is a privilege that subjects the applicant to exacting scrutiny at any stage of the proceedings, whether during the original petition or the oath-taking stage under Republic Act No. 530 [5]. It is the applicant's duty to affirmatively establish all legal requirements, and the court *motu proprio* may deny the application if requirements are lacking, regardless of government objection [4]. The Court emphasized that for the government, "it is almost never too late" to question an applicant's qualifications [4, 6]. Citing *Yay Chin v. Republic* and *Lim v. Republic*, the Court reiterated that the government's right to appeal is essential and cannot be rendered nugatory [4, 7].

Petition granted. The order refusing the appeal is set aside, and the respondent Judge is directed to approve the record on appeal [7].
