**I. CAPTION**
ITOGON-SUYOC MINES, INC. v. SAÑGILO-ITOGON WORKERS' UNION, G.R. No. L-24189, August 30, 1968, Sanchez, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. dismissed members of respondent Sañgilo-Itogon Workers' Union ("Sangilo"). In response, Sangilo staged a strike on May 28, 1958. On June 2, 1958, the company filed an injunction suit, and the strike effectively ended. On July 12, 1960—over two years later—Sangilo filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) demanding reinstatement and back wages for 107 dismissed members.

Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing: (1) Sangilo lacked capacity to sue because the Department of Labor cancelled its registration permit on March 31, 1960; (2) the suit violated the rule against splitting a cause of action because a prior ULP case (Case 50-ULP-Pang) involving two other employees had already been decided; and (3) the respondents were guilty of laches for the two-year delay in filing. The CIR ruled in favor of 15 employees who testified, ordering their reinstatement with back wages. Petitioner appealed.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the union has legal capacity to sue despite the cancellation of its registration permit.
2. W/N the action is barred by the rule against splitting a cause of action.
3. W/N the respondents’ claim for reinstatement is barred by laches.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** A registered labor union enjoys the right to sue as long as there is no final order cancelling its permit. Even if the permit is lost during the pendency of the case, the union may continue as a party to represent its members, subject to the understanding that the decision is binding on those who have not withdrawn (*Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union v. CIR*). Furthermore, the real parties in interest are the dismissed employees, and the error in the union's capacity, if any, is technical and does not affect substantial rights [1-3].

2. **NO.** The rule against splitting a cause of action applies only when actions are between the same parties. The previous ULP case involved only two laborers (Baldo and Manaois), while the present case involves 107 different employees. Each employee has a separate and distinct cause of action arising from their particular dismissal (*A. Soriano y Cia. v. Jose*). While they may be joined by the union, the causes of action remain distinct [4-6].

3. **NO.** Laches does not apply. While there was a delay of two years, the laborers belong to the lower economic stratum and cannot be expected to possess the foresight of those with high formal education (*Carillo v. Allied Workers' Association*). They relied on their union leaders to act. Moreover, the doctrine of stale demand requires that the defendant not be responsible for the delay; here, the Petitioner contributed to the delay by filing an injunction suit regarding the legality of the strike, which the union waited to resolve before filing the ULP complaint [7-11].

The Supreme Court **AFFIRMED** the judgment of the CIR, with instructions to deduct earnings obtained from other employment from the back wages.
