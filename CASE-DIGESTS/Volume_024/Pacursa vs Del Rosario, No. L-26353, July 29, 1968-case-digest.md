I. CAPTION
PERLA C. PACURSA v. SIMEON DEL ROSARIO and the HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-26353, July 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On February 24, 1957, Francisco del Rosario and members of his vaudeville troupe died when their vessel caught fire in Jolo [1]. Respondent Simeon del Rosario, Francisco's father, filed a suit (Civil Case 2419-P) against Equitable Insurance & Casualty Co., Inc. on September 6, 1963, to collect proceeds from a Master Accident Policy covering the troupe [2].

On December 7, 1965—over eight years after the accident—petitioner Perla Pacursa, claiming to be the heir of two deceased troupe members, filed a motion to intervene "in her behalf and for others similarly situated" [2]. However, the defendant insurance company completed the presentation of its evidence and trial ended on December 8, 1965 [3]. The trial court denied the motion on December 27, 1965, ruling that since the hearing had terminated, intervention was barred under Rule 12, Section 2 of the Rules of Court [3]. Pacursa filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the motion for intervention filed after the parties had concluded the presentation of evidence should be allowed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition on three grounds:

First, the petitioner is guilty of **laches**. She waited over eight years from the date of the accident and two years after the respondent commenced his suit before filing for intervention. Under the policy, actions were to be filed within a limited period. Failing to assert her rights within a reasonable time constitutes inexcusable delay [5].

Second, allowing intervention would cause **undue delay and prejudice** to the original parties. The intervention would require reopening the case to prove that the specific troupe members survived the beneficiary, necessitating new evidence and retarding the disposition of the case [6, 7].

Third, under **Section 2, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court**, intervention is permitted only "before or during a trial" [8]. The Court defined "trial" in a restricted sense as "the period for the introduction of evidence by both parties" [9]. Since the defendant had closed its evidence on December 8, 1965—before the motion was heard—the trial had already terminated, rendering the lower court powerless to grant intervention [9]. Furthermore, judgment had already been rendered on the merits, and intervention is merely ancillary to existing litigation; it cannot be granted once the court has lost jurisdiction over the principal case [10].

Petition dismissed [11].
