I. CAPTION
WILLIAM C. PFLEIDER v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Represented by the Land Authority), ET AL., No. L-24990, July 3, 1968, Sanchez, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee William C. Pfleider obtained a favorable decision from the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental in Civil Case No. 206 [2]. The defendants-appellants, the Republic of the Philippines (represented by the Land Authority) and Jose G. Espino, appealed this decision to the Supreme Court [1, 2]. After the parties filed their briefs and the case was submitted for decision, they decided to settle the dispute amicably and submitted a Compromise Agreement to the Court on June 19, 1968 [2]. Under the agreement, Pfleider waived his rights under the lower court's decision, rendering it unenforceable, while the Republic waived its rights and interest in the property arising from the Deed of Absolute Sale sought to be enforced in the action [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N judgment should be rendered based on the compromise agreement submitted by the parties. [4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court approved the compromise agreement and rendered judgment in accordance with its terms [5]. The Court found the agreement valid, noting that the parties, assisted by their respective counsel, arrived at a mutual settlement where the plaintiff-appellee waived his rights under the appealed decision in exchange for the defendants-appellants' waiver of their rights under the Deed of Absolute Sale [2, 3]. The agreement also specified that the Republic's waiver did not prevent the government from acquiring the property in the future for land reform purposes under existing legislation [3]. The judgment constitutes an obligation based on the compromise which supersedes the previous judgment on the merits [5].

Disposition: The compromise agreement is approved and judgment is rendered in accordance therewith [5].
