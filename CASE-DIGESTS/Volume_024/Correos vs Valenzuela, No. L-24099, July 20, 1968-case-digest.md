I. CAPTION
CLOTILDE CORREOS, ET AL. v. LADISLAO VALENZUELA Y PEREZ and EMILIO DIZON, G.R. No. L-24099, July 20, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On June 20, 1962, Exequiel Correos alighted from a jeepney when another jeepney, driven by Ladislao Valenzuela and owned by Emilio Dizon, bumped the rear of the first vehicle, pinning Exequiel between them [1]. He died from his injuries on July 5, 1962 [1]. His heirs filed an action for damages [2]. The defendants filed an answer but failed to appear on the day set for trial [2]. Consequently, the trial court allowed the plaintiffs to present their evidence before the Deputy Clerk of Court appointed as Commissioner [2].

Defendants filed a motion to set aside the order, alleging their counsel was suddenly ill and had advised them not to appear [2]. However, the motion was not verified and was not accompanied by affidavits of merit [2]. The trial court denied the motion and rendered judgment ordering Valenzuela to pay damages, with Dizon subsidiarily liable [3], [2]. Defendants appealed, challenging the validity of the proceedings before the Commissioner and the denial of their motion [3].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the presentation of evidence before a Commissioner due to defendants' non-appearance was valid.
2. W/N the motion for relief from judgment was properly denied due to the lack of affidavits of merit.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The proceedings before the Commissioner appointed by the lower court for the presentation of plaintiffs' evidence, upon the failure of defendants to appear, were valid and in accordance with court practice followed in default and similar cases [4], [5]. The Court ruled that the procedural rules invoked by the appellants regarding trials refer to contentious cases where both parties are available and ready to go to trial [4], [5].

2. **YES.** The Court held that the motion for relief from judgment was properly denied because it was not supported by affidavits of merit [6]. It is insufficient to merely allege in the motion that the movant has a "good and meritorious defense," as this is a mere conclusion and expression of opinion [6]. The rules require such motions to be supported by affidavits, depositions, or sworn statements proving not only the grounds relied upon (e.g., excusable negligence) but also the merits of the movant's case [7], [8]. This ensures the court can determine if reopening the case would serve a useful purpose or be a useless gesture [7], [8].

Decision affirmed [8].
