I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. CONSORCIO PELAGO Y BEKILLA**, G.R. No. L-24884, August 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 896, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On December 20, 1964, in Ozamiz City, Braulio Torres died from a stab wound in the abdomen inflicted by the accused, Consorcio Pelago. The prosecution’s lone eyewitness, Alfredo Metillo (the victim's brother-in-law), testified that while he, the accused, and the victim were standing in a triangle engaged in ordinary conversation, Pelago suddenly stabbed Torres while the latter had his arms crossed in front of him. The defense presented a different version through witness Honorato Capa, claiming that Torres attempted to strangle Pelago, prompting the accused to stab him in self-defense. The Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental rejected the plea of self-defense, finding the location of the wound consistent with the prosecution's theory, and convicted Pelago of murder.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the accused acted in self-defense.
2. W/N the killing was attended by treachery, qualifying the crime to murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's rejection of self-defense. The physical evidence showed the stab wound pierced the victim's left arm and penetrated the abdomen, which aligns with the testimony that the victim had his arms crossed, rather than the defense's claim of a strangulation struggle. Additionally, the Court noted that the accused’s conduct—fleeing the scene and throwing away the weapon—was "not the behaviour of one who killed another in self-defense."

2. **NO.** Under Article 13, subsection 16 of the Revised Penal Code, treachery applies only when the culprit employs means consciously adopted to insure the crime's commission without risk to himself. The Court held that mere suddenness of an attack does not constitute *alevosia* unless the aggressor consciously adopted the mode of attack. Given that the parties were in "ordinary conversation" with no prior altercation, and the evidence did not positively prove the accused reflected on the means of execution, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused. Citing *United States v. Namit*, the Court ruled the crime committed was Homicide, not Murder.

**The decision was MODIFIED.** The accused was found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of *prisión mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusión temporal*.
