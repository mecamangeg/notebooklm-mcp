**I. CAPTION**
**CANDELARIO ALMENDRAS, TIMOTEO T. OMAY, ET AL. v. AMADO DEL ROSARIO, ET AL.**, G.R. No. L-20158, July 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioners Almendras, Omay, and 173 others were appointed as officials and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System by the City Mayor of Cebu on July 1, 1961, and subsequent dates [1]. The respondent Commissioner of Civil Service refused to attest to and approve these appointments, contending that the proper appointing power was the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, not the City Mayor [1]. Consequently, petitioners filed an action for mandamus in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu to compel the Commissioner to approve their appointments and to order the City Treasurer to pay their salaries [1]. The CFI ruled in favor of the petitioners, declaring the City Mayor vested with the power to appoint and ordering the payment of salaries [2]. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court [2].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the City Mayor of Cebu has the power to appoint the officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The power to appoint officers and employees of the Osmeña Waterworks System is lodged in the Secretary of Public Works and Communications [3].

The Supreme Court applied the ruling in *Duterte v. Moreno* (G.R. No. L-15142), which involved the exact same issue [4]. The Court rejected the reliance on Section 1916 of the Revised Administrative Code, holding that it applies only to waterworks owned by provinces and municipalities, not chartered cities like Cebu [5, 6]. Furthermore, the Mayor's appointing power under Section 21 of the Cebu City Charter applies only when the appointment is "not otherwise provided for by law" [6]. Under Commonwealth Act 424 and Section 79(D) of the Revised Administrative Code, personnel in engineering districts (including City Engineers who supervise waterworks) are appointed by the Department Head (Secretary of Public Works) upon recommendation of the Bureau Chief [7, 8]. Additionally, Act 2009, which created the Osmeña Waterworks System, gives the Director of Public Works exclusive charge and control over the system [8].

Consequently, the decision was **REVERSED** insofar as it declared the Mayor had appointing power. However, the Court **AFFIRMED** the order to pay the salaries of the petitioners for services actually rendered from the date of their appointment until the decision becomes final, based on equitable grounds and prior jurisprudence regarding payment of back salaries [9].
