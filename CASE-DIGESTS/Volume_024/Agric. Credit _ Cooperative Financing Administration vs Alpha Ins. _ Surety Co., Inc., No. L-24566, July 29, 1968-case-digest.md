**I. CAPTION**
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT & COOPERATIVE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION (ACCFA) v. ALPHA INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., G.R. No. L-24566, July 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

**II. FACTS**
On February 14, 1958, Alpha Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. issued a fidelity bond to guarantee the Asingan FACOMA against loss from the dishonesty of its Secretary-Treasurer, Ricardo Ladines. The rights to this bond were assigned to ACCFA. Ladines subsequently misappropriated funds, prompting ACCFA to notify Alpha Insurance and file a proof of loss on October 10, 1958. Despite demands, Alpha Insurance refused to pay.

On May 30, 1960, ACCFA filed a suit against Alpha Insurance. Alpha Insurance moved to dismiss the complaint, citing Condition 8 of the bond, which stipulated that no action shall be maintained unless commenced "within one year from the time of making claim for the loss." The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action was filed beyond the contractual one-year period from the filing of the claim. ACCFA appealed to the Supreme Court. [1-5]

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the stipulation in the fidelity bond limiting the period for filing an action to one year from the making of the claim is valid. [6]

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the stipulation is void. A fidelity bond is in the nature of a contract of insurance and is subject to Section 61-A of the Insurance Act (Act No. 2427), which invalidates any stipulation limiting the time for commencing an action to less than one year from the time the *cause of action accrues*. [7, 8]

The Court explained that a cause of action does not accrue until the party obligated refuses, expressly or impliedly, to comply with its duty. Therefore, the period for instituting an action must be reckoned from the insurer's *refusal* to pay, not from the filing of the claim of loss. Condition 8 of the bond, by computing the period from the filing of the claim, effectively limits the period to less than one year from the accrual of the cause of action, contradicting the public policy expressed in Section 61-A. Consequently, Condition 8 is null and void, and the action may be brought within the statutory period of limitation for written contracts under Article 1144 of the New Civil Code. [8-10]

The appealed order granting the motion to dismiss is **REVERSED** and set aside, and the records are remanded to the Court of First Instance. [11]
