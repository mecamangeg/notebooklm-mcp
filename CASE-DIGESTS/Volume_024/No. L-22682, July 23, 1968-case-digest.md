I. CAPTION
GORGONIO PABILING v. ISIDORO PARINACIO, DIRECTOR OF LANDS, and SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, G.R. No. L-22682, July 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Gorgonio Pabiling filed a sales application for a tract of land in Isabela in 1932. In 1947, a conflict arose with Crisanto Parinacio (predecessor of respondent Isidoro Parinacio), who claimed rights over the same land. The parties executed a joint affidavit/amicable settlement in 1947 before a Land Inspector, where Pabiling relinquished rights to the area occupied by Parinacio [1]. Parinacio’s homestead application was subsequently approved. In 1953, Pabiling protested, alleging the settlement was obtained through deceit and that he did not understand it [2, 3].

The Director of Lands decided in favor of Pabiling. Parinacio appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (Secretary). Pabiling argued the appeal was filed out of time because the notice of the Director's decision was mailed to Parinacio earlier [4]. However, the notice was addressed to "c/o Santiago Parinacio" (a non-existent person) at a wrong address, and Crisanto was already dead at the time, facts known to the Bureau [5]. The Secretary reversed the Director’s decision, upholding the 1947 settlement based on the Land Inspector’s testimony and Parinacio's continuous occupation [6, 7].

Pabiling filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Isabela to annul the Secretary’s decision [8]. During trial, Pabiling failed to appear, and his motion for postponement was denied [9]. The CFI dismissed the petition. Pabiling appealed to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to the Supreme Court on questions of law [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trial court erred in denying the petitioner's motion for postponement due to his absence.
2. W/N the appeal from the Director of Lands to the Secretary was perfected on time despite the notice of decision being returned unclaimed.
3. W/N the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources gravely abused his discretion in reversing the factual findings of the Director of Lands.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Petitioner's failure to appear was unexplained and unjustified, and no effort was made to show his testimony would change the result [10]. Moreover, in a certiorari action reviewing an administrative decision, the court is limited to the evidence presented before the administrative official. A judicial review of executive decisions does not import a trial *de novo* but determines if findings are supported by evidence and free from fraud (*Lovina v. Moreno*) [11].

2. **YES.** (The appeal was valid). The notice of the Director's decision relied upon by petitioner to claim the appeal period had lapsed was ineffective. It was sent to a deceased person at a wrong address, despite the Bureau knowing of the death and the correct address [5]. Furthermore, since the party was represented by counsel, notice should have been sent to the counsel, not the client [12]. There was no proof the decision was received significantly earlier than the filing of the appeal.

3. **NO.** The Secretary has direct control over the Director of Lands, and the Director’s decisions must yield to the Secretary’s [13]. The Secretary validly weighed the evidence, giving more credit to the Land Inspector’s testimony regarding the 1947 settlement than to petitioner’s denial [14]. Even if the Secretary erred in appreciating the veracity of witnesses, such error does not constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction warranting a writ of certiorari (*Aureus v. Sec. of Agri. & Nat. Resources*) [14].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
