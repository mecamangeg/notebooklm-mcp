I. CAPTION
AMBROCIO LACUNA v. BENJAMIN H. ABES, G.R. No. L-28613, August 27, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Benjamin Abes was convicted of counterfeiting treasury warrants and sentenced to *prision mayor*. He was released in 1959 on a conditional pardon. In the 1967 elections, Abes ran for Mayor of Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija, despite the Election Registration Board denying his application to register as a voter. Abes won the election and was proclaimed on November 16, 1967. Petitioner Ambrocio Lacuna, who placed second, filed a petition for *quo warranto* in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Nueva Ecija, arguing Abes was ineligible due to his conviction and non-registration as a voter.

On December 7, 1967, while the case was pending, the President granted Abes an absolute and unconditional pardon, restoring his full civil and political rights. The CFI dismissed the *quo warranto* petition, ruling that the pardon cured Abes' ineligibility. Lacuna appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that Abes was disqualified "at the time of the election" and the subsequent pardon could not retroact to cure this defect.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a plenary pardon granted after the election but before the date fixed for assuming office removes the disqualification of a winning candidate.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision. While Abes was indeed disqualified at the time of the election due to the accessory penalty of "perpetual special disqualification for the exercise of the right of suffrage" (Art. 32, Revised Penal Code) [1], the subsequent absolute pardon removed this disability.

The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Pelobello v. Palatino* (72 Phil. 441) and *Cristobal v. Labrador* (71 Phil. 34), holding that the pardoning power should not be unnecessarily limited or impaired by legislative action or restrictive judicial interpretation [2]. An absolute pardon blots out the crime and removes all disabilities resulting from the conviction [2]. Since the pardon was granted before the date fixed by law for assuming office, it effectively restored Abes' eligibility, enabling him to assume the position in deference to the popular will [3].

Regarding Abes' non-registration as a voter, the Court ruled that registration is not a qualification for a candidate under Section 2174 of the Revised Administrative Code, but merely a step towards voting, citing *Rocha v. Cordis* (103 Phil. 327) [4].

**Decision affirmed.**
