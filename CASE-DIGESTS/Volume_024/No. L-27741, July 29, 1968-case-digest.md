I. CAPTION
R.B. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, LIMITED and RAY N. KITTILSTVEDT v. HON. MANUEL LOPEZ ENAGE and EASTERN TIMBER CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27741, July 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Ray Kittilstvedt held a non-transferable timber license which expired on June 30, 1959 [1]. On December 22, 1959, five months after its expiration, he assigned the license to respondent Eastern Timber Corporation (Eastern) in exchange for shares of stock [1]. This transfer violated Forestry Administrative Order No. 21, which prohibits transfers within three years of issuance and requires government approval [2, 3]. Kittilstvedt later renewed the license in his own name and transferred it to petitioner R.B. Industrial Development Company (Industrial) in 1965 [4]. Eastern filed a complaint with the Bureau of Forestry but withdrew it, subsequently filing Civil Case 1087 in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Agusan for specific performance and nullification of the transfer to Industrial [5, 6]. The CFI denied petitioners' motion to dismiss and issued a preliminary injunction [7, 8]. Petitioners filed for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Eastern has a cause of action to enforce the 1959 deed of assignment.
2. W/N the CFI has jurisdiction to adjudicate the cancellation and issuance of timber licenses.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Eastern has no cause of action because the assignment was illegal and void. The Court held that the license had already expired at the time of transfer and was explicitly non-transferable [9]. Furthermore, the transfer violated Forestry Administrative Order No. 21, which prohibits the conveyance of licenses within three years of issuance and without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [2, 3]. Under the principle *ex dolo malo non oritur actio*, a party to an illegal contract cannot seek relief in court [9]. Even if valid, the transfer would be ineffective without administrative approval [10].

2. **NO.** The Bureau of Forestry has exclusive jurisdiction over the management of public forests and the granting of licenses under Section 1816 of the Revised Administrative Code [11, 12]. The Court applied the doctrine of primacy of administrative jurisdiction, stating that where the law confines the power to determine particular questions to an administrative office, its jurisdiction prevails over the courts [12]. Eastern effectively bypassed administrative remedies by withdrawing its complaint from the Bureau, preventing the CFI from taking cognizance of the case [12].

Petition granted. The writ of preliminary injunction is made permanent, and the respondent Judge is directed to dismiss Civil Case 1087 [13].
