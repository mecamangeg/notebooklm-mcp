I. CAPTION
ANTONIO M. PEREZ, as Judicial Guardian of BENIGNO, ANGELA and ANTONIO, all surnamed PEREZ y TUASON v. J. ANTONIO ARANETA, as Trustee of Minors, G.R. No. L-18414, July 15, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Antonio M. Perez, judicial guardian of his children (the minors), sought to remove Respondent J. Antonio Araneta as trustee. Perez filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Rizal alleging seven charges against Araneta, including: (1) withholding allowances to coerce approval of sales; (2) making improper and speculative investments in companies like Ramie Textiles and Lepanto Consolidated Mining; (3) non-cooperation; and (4) self-dealing regarding the sale of trust property to Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd., in which Araneta held shares [1-6].

The lower court examined each charge and dismissed the petition on October 31, 1960, finding the accusations unsubstantiated. Specifically, it found that delays in payments were due to insufficient funds, the investments were sound, and the trustee's interest in Insular Life was negligible (100 shares), negating self-dealing [1, 3, 5, 7]. Perez appealed the order directly to the Supreme Court [1, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court can review the findings of fact made by the lower court in a direct appeal.
2. W/N the trustee should be removed for alleged mismanagement, conflict of interest, and lack of cooperation.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** When a party appeals directly to the Supreme Court, he is deemed to have waived the right to dispute any finding of fact made by the trial court [8, 9]. The appellant is limited to disputing the correctness of the law applied. Consonant with time-honored tradition, the Supreme Court holds trial judges better situated to make conclusions on questions of fact and will not disturb such rulings when supported by evidence [9, 10].

2. **NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's absolving of the trustee. The paramount consideration in guardianship is the welfare of the minor beneficiaries [11, 12]. The Court held that the trustor relied fully upon the trustee's judgment and discretion, which should not be disturbed except upon clear proof of fraud, bad faith, or transactions manifestly prejudicial to the minors' interests [12, 13]. The evidence showed no failure by Araneta to live up to his responsibilities. While there was "absence of goodwill" and "clashes of temperament" between the guardian and trustee, this did not justify removal absent proof that the minors' well-being was subordinated to the trustee's personal interest [12, 14].

The order of the lower court is affirmed [13].
