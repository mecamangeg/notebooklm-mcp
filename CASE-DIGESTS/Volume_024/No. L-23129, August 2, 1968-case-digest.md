I. CAPTION
ISIDRA FARAON and LUCIA DE MESA v. TOMAS PRIELA, G.R. No. L-23129, August 2, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On September 10, 1960, a Cadillac owned by appellants Faraon and De Mesa got stuck on railroad tracks in Muntinlupa. A train operated by appellee Priela approached; despite appellant De Mesa signaling for it to stop, the train hit and destroyed the car. Priela was charged with damage to property through reckless imprudence. The Court of First Instance (CFI) acquitted Priela, finding the incident was a "freak accident" and explicitly declaring he was not negligent. The CFI credited evidence that embankments obstructed the view until the train was 75 meters away, while the stopping distance required was 300 meters. Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court solely on the civil aspect of the case.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants can recover civil damages from the accused despite his acquittal based on a finding of no negligence.

IV. RULING
**NO.** Under Rule 111, Section 3(c) of the Rules of Court, the extinction of the penal action does not carry with it the extinction of the civil action, *unless* the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist.

In this case, the lower court's final judgment not only acquitted Priela but explicitly declared that the collision was not due to any negligence on his part. Since the appellants' civil action is predicated upon this alleged negligence—which the court found did not exist—the acquittal in the criminal action necessarily carries with it the extinction of the civil responsibility (*Tan v. Standard Vacuum Oil Co.*; *De Soriano v. Albornoz*). The Supreme Court affirmed the decision.
