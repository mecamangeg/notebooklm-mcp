I. CAPTION
HIDPION P. DEL ROSARIO and AMADO SAÑEZ v. ABELARDO SUBIDO, MIGUEL YUVIENCO, DOMINADOR CAMERINO and JOSE MENDOZA, G.R. No. L-23934, July 25, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Del Rosario and Sañez were appointed by then-Mayor Ilano of Imus, Cavite, as Chief of Police and Police Lieutenant, respectively, in October 1963 [1], [2]. Both appointments were designated as "permanent" by the Mayor, but petitioners only possessed civil service eligibility for "patrolman," not for the specific positions of Chief of Police or Police Lieutenant [2]. The Civil Service Commissioner (respondent Subido) attested Del Rosario’s appointment only as "provisional" under Section 24(c) of Republic Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959) due to lack of appropriate eligibility, while Sañez’s appointment was returned without approval for lacking requirements [1], [3].

In January 1964, the new Mayor, respondent Camerino, terminated petitioners' services due to lack of appropriate civil service eligibility and confidence, offering them positions as patrolmen instead [3]. Petitioners refused and filed a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Cavite [4]. The trial court dismissed the petition, ruling that their appointments were provisional and thus terminable [5]. Petitioners appealed directly to the Supreme Court on questions of law [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners' civil service eligibility for "patrolman" qualifies them for permanent appointments as Chief of Police or Police Lieutenant.
2. W/N the termination of petitioners' provisional appointments was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under the Civil Service Act of 1959 (R.A. 2260), positions in the competitive service require qualification in an *appropriate* examination [6]. The Commissioner of Civil Service has prescribed special examinations for Chiefs of Police distinct from those for patrolmen [6]. Although Section 2266 of the Revised Administrative Code mentions only one examination for the police service, this must be interpreted in harmony with R.A. 2260, which requires appropriate eligibility for the specific position [7], [8]. Consequently, possessing only "patrolman" eligibility does not qualify a person for permanent appointment as Police Lieutenant or Chief of Police, justifying the Commissioner’s attestation of the appointment as merely provisional [8], [9].

2. **YES.** A provisional appointment allows a non-eligible appointee to hold office only until an eligible is available, and in no case shall it extend beyond thirty (30) days from receipt by the appointing officer of the certification of eligibles [9]. The Civil Service Commission certified the availability of Chief of Police eligibles in January 1964 [10]. Therefore, Del Rosario's right to hold office expired, at the latest, thirty days after the Mayor received said certification [11]. Regarding Sañez, his appointment was never attested or approved by the Commissioner, leaving him with no cause of action [11].

The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed.
