**I. CAPTION**
THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS v. THE COURT OF APPEALS and ANITA U. LORENZANA, G.R. No. L-21059, July 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Respondent Anita U. Lorenzana, a successful bidder for a structure on a San Lazaro Estate lot, obtained a building permit from the City Engineer of Manila on August 25, 1959, to construct a three-storey building [1, 2]. When construction was well-advanced, the City Engineer, acting on representations by the Bureau of Lands regarding a conflict with other lease applicants, ordered the suspension of the construction and threatened to revoke the permit [2]. Lorenzana filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to enjoin the City Engineer from enforcing the suspension [2]. The Director of Lands intervened, arguing the suspension should remain until the conflicting lease rights were resolved [2]. The CFI ruled in favor of Lorenzana, maintaining the injunction [3]. The Director of Lands appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), but the City Engineer did not appeal [3]. The CA affirmed the decision, ruling that the judgment had become final against the City Engineer and that the case was moot as the building was already finished [3, 4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Director of Lands can successfully insist on the suspension of the building permit despite the City Engineer's failure to appeal.

**IV. RULING**
**NO.** The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals [5]. The Court held that whether or not to insist on the suspension of the building permit was a matter primarily addressed to the discretion of the City Engineer [5]. The City Engineer’s failure to appeal demonstrated that he was agreeable to the maintenance of the permit [5]. Consequently, the judgment of the trial court became final as to the City Engineer, the effect of which was as if he himself had set aside the suspension order [5]. Furthermore, the case had become moot because the construction of the building was already finished [6]. Any question regarding the demolition of the building or the right to lease the lot must be threshed out in a separate action, not in this case which concerns only the building permit [6].

**V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS**
None. (Justices Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred in the main decision) [7].
