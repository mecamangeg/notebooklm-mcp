I. CAPTION
SAURA IMPORT & EXPORT CO., INC. and RAMON E. SAURA v. JUDGE ARSENIO SOLIDUM, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF DAVAO and CHINA BANKING CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-24514, July 31, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1953, petitioners purchased two parcels of land from the Board of Liquidators under Republic Act No. 477. In 1961, respondent China Banking Corporation filed a collection suit against petitioners for unpaid debts related to importation financing. A writ of preliminary attachment was issued and levied upon said lands. Petitioners initially moved to discharge the attachment but later withdrew the motion. In July 1962, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement approved by the trial court, wherein petitioners admitted liability, the bank granted a reduced amount and extended payment term, and the parties stipulated that the attachment on the lands would remain in full force as security.

When petitioners failed to pay within the stipulated two-year period, the court issued a writ of execution in 1964. Petitioners then filed a motion to lift the attachment/levy, invoking for the first time Section 8 of R.A. No. 477, which prohibits lands acquired under the Act from being liable for debts contracted within ten years from the issuance of the title. The trial court denied the motion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the statutory exemption under Section 8 of R.A. No. 477 binds the respondent bank despite the absence of such annotation on the certificate of title.
2. W/N the petitioners are estopped from challenging the validity of the attachment and levy.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The prohibition in Section 8 of R.A. No. 477 is not a "lien, claim or right" arising under law which, under Section 39 of Act 496 (Land Registration Act), binds third parties without registration [1]. While the titles contained an annotation regarding the restriction on alienation, there was no annotation regarding the exemption from liability for pre-existing debts. The respondent bank cannot be presumed to know the specific origin of the lands (acquisition under R.A. 477) without proper registration to affect third persons [2].

2. **YES.** Petitioners are estopped from raising the illegality of the levy. Under Articles 1431 and 1433 of the Civil Code and Section 68(a), Rule 123 of the Rules of Court, petitioners' conduct rendered them conclusive on the matter [3]. They concealed the origin of the land and voluntarily offered it as security in the Compromise Agreement to obtain benefits, such as the reduction of debt and extension of time [4]-[5]. A party is precluded from repudiating an obligation voluntarily assumed after accepting benefits therefrom. Furthermore, the attachment was embodied in a final judgment based on the compromise; to set it aside would improperly alter a final judgment [6].

Petition denied; injunction dissolved.
