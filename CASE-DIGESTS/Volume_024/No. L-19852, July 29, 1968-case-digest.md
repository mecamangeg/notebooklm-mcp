I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MANSUETO JAMERO, RODRIGO HONORIO LOPEZ, JULIAN PABICON and JOEL BINGCANG, G.R. No. L-19852, July 29, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On July 19, 1958, Atty. Ernesto Piccio, a councilor and lawyer, was killed in Tinampaan, Cadiz, Negros Occidental. The prosecution established that the killing was politically motivated and orchestrated by appellant Rodrigo Honorio Lopez and his group, who held grievances against the victim. Meetings to plot the murder occurred between February and July 1958.

On the day of the killing, Piccio gave a ride in his jeep to appellants Mansueto Jamero and Julian Pabicon, and conspirator-turned-state-witness Inocencio Retirado. Lopez followed in a separate car to provide signals. At a designated spot, Jamero asked to stop to urinate. Appellant Joel Bingcang then appeared from behind a tree, distracting Piccio. Pabicon struck the victim with a jack, and Jamero stabbed him multiple times. Retirado fled and later surrendered.

During trial, the prosecution moved to discharge Retirado as a state witness. The defense opposed, arguing Retirado had a prior conviction for malicious mischief (alleging moral turpitude) and was one of the most guilty. The trial court granted the discharge and subsequently convicted the four appellants of murder, sentencing them to death.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the discharge of the state witness was proper despite allegations of a prior conviction involving moral turpitude and being equally guilty.
2. W/N the guilt of the appellants was proven beyond reasonable doubt despite defenses of alibi and attacks on witness credibility.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the crime of malicious mischief does not necessarily involve moral turpitude. In the absence of evidence showing the gravity, nature, or value of the property destroyed, the Court cannot presume moral turpitude [Moore v. State]. Furthermore, Retirado was not the "most guilty" as he played a minor role (lookout), did not inflict injuries, and voluntarily surrendered. Even if a discharged witness lacks some qualifications under Rule 119, Section 9, their testimony is not automatically discarded, and an error in discharge is not a reversible error [People v. Castaneda].

2. **YES.** The Court affirmed the findings of the trial court.
   - **Credibility:** Minor inconsistencies in Retirado’s testimony regarding dates and details did not destroy his credibility but rather indicated good faith. His testimony was corroborated by other competent witnesses.
   - **Conspiracy:** Lopez was liable as a principal by induction. Bingcang was liable as a conspirator for waiting at the scene and distracting the victim, even if he did not physically attack him, as the act of one is the act of all.
   - **Alibi:** The defense of alibi (Jamero and Pabicon claiming to be in Manila; Bingcang claiming to be in an Iloilo jail) was rejected. Positive identification by credible witnesses prevails over alibi. Specifically regarding Bingcang, the police blotter presented was inadmissible because the signature of the custodian was not authenticated. While judicial notice applies to the incumbency of public officers, it does not presume the genuineness of a signature on a document without a seal [People v. Teorino].

   The judgment was **AFFIRMED**, but the death sentence was reduced to **life imprisonment** for lack of necessary votes.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Concepcion, C.J., concurs in the result.
