I. CAPTION
CONCORDIA T. ARONG v. CONRADA SENO, MOISES BINGHAY and JOSE C. BORROMEO, G.R. No. L-25295, August 14, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On August 17, 1959, spouses Conrada Seno and Moises Binghay (Respondents) filed a foreclosure suit (Case No. R-6279) against spouses Salome Ceniza and Nicasio Tunacao. The Tunacaos filed their answer with a counterclaim. On November 17, 1963, after the respondents had begun presenting their evidence, Salome Ceniza died. Her heirs, including petitioner Concordia T. Arong, were ordered to substitute her as defendants.

On April 21, 1965, Arong filed a motion to admit an amended answer, which asserted the defense of usury—a defense not previously alleged in the original answer of her deceased mother. Respondent Judge Borromeo denied the motion. Arong filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that as the real debtor and accommodation party, she had a right to defend herself and set up compulsory counterclaims regarding payments made.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the admission of the amended answer filed after the trial had commenced.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, ruling that the respondent Judge did not abuse his discretion. The Court held that since the petitioner was merely a substitute for the deceased original defendant, and the trial had already begun with the presentation of the plaintiffs' evidence, the answer could be amended only with leave of court.

Under **Section 3, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court**, the court may refuse an amendment "if it appears to the court... that the... defense is substantially altered." The Court found that introducing the defense of **usury**, which was not present in the original answer, constituted a substantial alteration of the defense. Furthermore, the Court noted that the petitioner could still prove her alleged payments under the original answer's averment that the deceased was merely an accommodation party, to show that the amount due is less than what is claimed.

The petition was **DISMISSED**, and the writ of preliminary injunction was dissolved.
