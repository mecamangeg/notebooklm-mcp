I. CAPTION
REGAL MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION and CELESTINO BAYLON v. HON. ANDRES REYES and PHILIPPINE METAL FOUNDRIES, INC., G.R. No. L-24388, July 29, 1968, 24 SCRA 352, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union and respondent Philippine Metal Foundries, Inc. (Company) had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) containing "no strike" and grievance clauses. On October 3, 1963, the Company dismissed petitioner Celestino Baylon, the Union president. In response, the Union declared a strike on October 5 and picketed the Company's premises.

On October 7, the Company filed a petition for injunction with damages against the Union in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal (presided by respondent Judge Reyes), alleging the strike was illegal and involved violence. Shortly thereafter, both parties filed separate Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges against each other in the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR): the Union charging illegal dismissal of Baylon (Case 3932-ULP), and the Company charging violation of the CBA and illegal strike (Case 3941-ULP).

Despite the pending ULP cases, the CFI proceeded with the civil case. On September 28, 1964, after the petitioners were declared in default for failure to appear at pre-trial, the CFI rendered a decision declaring the strike illegal, terminating the employment status of the Union officers and members, and ordering them to pay over P60,000 in damages. The petitioners filed a petition for certiorari with prohibition, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction due to the pending labor dispute in the CIR.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance (CFI) has jurisdiction over a petition for injunction and damages arising from a labor dispute when Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) cases involving the same issues are pending before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance acted without jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court held that the petition for injunction, on its very face, presented for resolution a ULP charge—specifically asking for the strike to be declared illegal and the strikers to be adjudged as having lost their employee status. These matters fall within the **exclusive competence** of the CIR. The Court reiterated the doctrine that when the issue involved in the main case is **interwoven** with a ULP case pending in the CIR, the main case does not come under the jurisdiction of the regular courts, even if it involves allegations of violence, intimidation, and coercion (*SMB Box Factory Workers Union v. Victoriano*).

Furthermore, the CFI's award of damages was improper. The right to damages depends on the evidence to be adduced in the ULP cases pending in the CIR. To allow the CFI to decide on damages while the ULP case is pending would sanction **split jurisdiction**, which is "obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice" (*Associated Labor Union v. Gomez*).

The Petition is **GRANTED**. The decision of the respondent CFI dated September 28, 1964, and its subsequent orders are annulled and set aside. The lower court is ordered to refrain from proceeding with the civil case until the CIR renders final judgment in the ULP cases.
