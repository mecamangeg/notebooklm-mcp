I. CAPTION
CITY OF MANILA v. TARLAC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, MANILA LODGE NO. 761, and ARMY AND NAVY CLUB OF MANILA, G.R. Nos. L-24557, L-24469, & L-24481, July 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
In 1911 and 1918, the City of Manila (City) sold reclaimed parcels of land to Manila Lodge No. 761 (BPOE) and the Army and Navy Club (ANC), respectively. The deeds of sale contained a stipulation reserving the City's right to repurchase the lots "for public purposes only" at any time after 50 years, at the *original price* plus the value of improvements [1-3]. These conditions were annotated on the Torrens titles [3].

In 1963, BPOE and ANC filed petitions to cancel these annotations, arguing that the repurchase clause was a *pacto de retro* sale limited to 10 years under the old Civil Code [4, 5]. The City Fiscal opined the City had no cause of action, so the City did not oppose the petitions. Consequently, the lower court issued an order in 1963 granting the cancellation, which was effectively a judgment by consent [5, 6]. Subsequently, BPOE sold its land to Tarlac Development Corporation (Tarlac) [7].

In 1964, the City filed petitions to reannotate the deleted entries. The lower court granted the petitions [7]. Tarlac, BPOE, and ANC appealed, arguing the 1963 order of cancellation was *res judicata* [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the 1963 court order cancelling the repurchase annotations constitutes *res judicata*.
2. W/N the City officials had the power to consent to the deletion of the City's right to repurchase.
3. W/N the Land Registration Court had jurisdiction to order reannotation under Section 112 of Act 496 despite the lack of unanimity among parties.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The 1963 order is null and void and does not constitute *res judicata* [8]. It was a judgment by consent where municipal officials assumed obligations not authorized by law. An agreement by officials to validate an invalid contract or waive municipal rights cannot be cured by a court judgment [8, 9]. Since the City officials lacked the power to consent to the deletion, the judgment based on that consent is void and not binding [9].

2. **NO.** The City officials lacked the authority to waive the repurchase stipulation. The Court held that the right to reacquire the property "for public purposes" is essentially the power of **eminent domain**, which is inalienable, imprescriptible, and exists regardless of stipulation [10]. Furthermore, the stipulation allowed the City to repurchase at the *original price*, not the current market value. Deleting this entry effectively "donated" the difference in value to the private entities, a prejudice to taxpayers that officials had no power to commit [11].

3. **YES.** While Section 112 of the Land Registration Act generally requires unanimity, the Land Registration Court may hear and determine issues if the parties acquiesce to submitting the controversy for determination on the merits [12, 13]. Here, the parties extensively argued the merits regarding the City's title and the nature of the contract [13].

**Orders affirmed.** The reannotation is ordered, subject to Tarlac Development Corporation's right to initiate a separate action to clarify its rights as a purchaser [14].
