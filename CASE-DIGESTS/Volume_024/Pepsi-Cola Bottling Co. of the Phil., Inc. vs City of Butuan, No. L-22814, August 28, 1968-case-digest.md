I. CAPTION
PEPSI-COLA BOTTLING CO. OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. v. CITY OF BUTUAN, MEMBERS OF THE MUNICIPAL BOARD, THE CITY MAYOR and THE CITY TREASURER, G.R. No. L-22814, August 28, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., a domestic corporation, sought to recover taxes paid under protest to the City of Butuan and to annul Municipal Ordinance No. 110, as amended by Ordinance No. 122. The ordinance imposed a tax of P0.10 per case of 24 bottles of soft drinks upon "any agent and/or consignee" of any dealer engaged in selling such drinks. It defined a "consignee or agent" as one who receives no less than 1,000 cases per month for resale. The tax was computed based on the "cargo manifest or bill of lading" showing the number of cases *received* within the month. Pepsi-Cola, which bottles its products in Cebu and ships them to its Butuan warehouse for distribution, argued that the ordinance was discriminatory, excessive, and an unauthorized import tax. The Court of First Instance of Agusan dismissed the complaint, ruling in favor of the City. Pepsi-Cola appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the ordinance constitutes an invalid import tax.
2. W/N the ordinance violates the constitutional requirement of uniformity of taxation (equal protection).

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The ordinance is invalid because it partakes of the nature of an import duty, which is beyond the authority of local governments to impose under Section 2(i) of Republic Act No. 2264. The tax is levied only upon agents or consignees and is based on the cargo manifest or bill of lading of goods "received," rather than sold. This indicates a clear intent to limit the tax to products brought into the City from the outside [1].

2. **YES.** The ordinance is discriminatory and violates the uniformity required by the Constitution. It imposes the tax only on sales by "agents or consignees" (who inherently deal with outside producers), while sales by local dealers acting on their own—regardless of volume—are exempt. This classification is unreasonable as it is not based on substantial distinctions germane to the purpose of the ordinance [2]-[3]. While double taxation is not constitutionally forbidden and the rate was not found to be excessive, the discriminatory nature and the character of the levy as an import tax render it void [4]-[2].

**Decision reversed.** The Ordinance is annulled, and the City of Butuan is ordered to refund the amounts collected from the petitioner [5].
