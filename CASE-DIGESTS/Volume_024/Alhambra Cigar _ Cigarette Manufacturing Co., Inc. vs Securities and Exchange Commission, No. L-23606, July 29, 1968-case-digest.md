I. CAPTION
ALHAMBRA CIGAR & CIGARETTE MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC. v. SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION, G.R. No. L-23606, July 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Alhambra Cigar & Cigarette Manufacturing Company, Inc. was incorporated on January 15, 1912, with a corporate term of 50 years. Its term expired on January 15, 1962, and it ceased transacting business and entered the three-year statutory liquidation period [1]. On June 20, 1963, Republic Act No. 3531 was enacted, amending Section 18 of the Corporation Law to empower private corporations to extend their corporate life [2].

On July 15, 1963, within the liquidation period, Alhambra’s board resolved to amend its articles of incorporation to extend its life for another 50 years, which was approved by stockholders on August 26, 1963 [3]. Alhambra filed the amended articles with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC denied the filing, ruling that R.A. 3531 could not be availed of because Alhambra’s term had already expired [4]. Alhambra appealed, arguing that it could extend its life because it was still in the process of liquidation [5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N a corporation may extend its corporate life by amending its articles of incorporation during the three-year statutory liquidation period when its original term of existence has already expired.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that a corporation cannot extend its life by amendment of its articles of incorporation effected during the three-year statutory period for liquidation when its original term has already expired [6].

The Court held that the privilege to extend corporate life under R.A. 3531 must be exercised before the expiry of the term fixed in the articles of incorporation [7]. Under Section 77 of the Corporation Law, the continuance of a dissolved corporation for three years is solely for the purpose of closing its affairs and "no other"; it is specifically enjoined from continuing the business for which it was established [8]. Since liquidation is necessary precisely because corporate life has ended, the juridical personality to do business cannot be extended during this period [8].

Furthermore, the Court distinguished "extension" from "renewal." To extend a charter is to increase the time of an existing one, while to renew is to revive a charter that has expired [9]. Philippine law (Section 18, Corporation Law) limits itself to "extension" and does not authorize "renewal" [9]. The Court also applied the *pari materia* rule, noting that Republic Act 1932 (amending the Insurance Act) explicitly requires extension "on or before the expiration" of the term, and R.A. 3531 should be read in the same light [10].

The ruling and order of the Securities and Exchange Commission are affirmed [11].
