I. CAPTION
JOSE P. STA. ANA v. FLORENTINO MALIWAT and TIBURCIO S. EVALLE, in his capacity as Director of Patents, G.R. No. L-23023, August 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 1018, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Florentino Maliwat filed an application on June 21, 1962, for the registration of the trademark "FLORMANN" used on shirts, pants, jackets, and shoes, claiming first use on July 6, 1955 [1]. Petitioner Jose P. Sta. Ana subsequently filed an application on September 18, 1962, for the tradename "FLORMEN SHOE MANUFACTURERS" used on shoes, claiming first use on April 8, 1959 [1].

Finding confusing similarity between "FLORMANN" and "FLORMEN," the Director of Patents declared an interference [2]. During the proceedings, the parties' counsel stipulated that Maliwat had used "FLORMANN" on men's wear since 1953 and on shoes since January 1962, while Sta. Ana used "FLORMEN" on shoes since April 1959 [3]. Based on this, the Director declared Maliwat the senior party and prior adopter, denying Sta. Ana's application [2]. Sta. Ana appealed, alleging that the stipulation regarding Maliwat's 1953 use was false and intercalated by the stenographer, and arguing that his use on shoes should prevail as Maliwat only used the mark on shoes in 1962 [4], [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is bound by the stipulation of facts made by counsel during the trial.
2. W/N the respondent's prior use of the trademark on clothing extends protection to its use on shoes.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that admissions made by parties in the pleadings or in the course of trial do not require proof and cannot be contradicted unless shown to have been made through palpable mistake, pursuant to Section 2, Rule 129 of the Revised Rules of Court [6]. The petitioner failed to substantiate the charge that the stipulation was intercalated, and the presumption that the stenographer regularly performed her duty stands [7]. Since the integrity of the record was intact and the stipulation was not shown to be a palpable mistake, the petitioner is bound by the admission that Maliwat established use since 1953, which is earlier than Sta. Ana's use in 1959 [8].

2. **YES.** Modern law recognizes that trademark protection extends to cases where the junior appropriator's use is likely to lead to a confusion of source, or forestall the normal potential expansion of the owner's business, even if the goods are not identical [9]. The Court cited jurisprudence establishing that manufacturers of men's clothing are entitled to protection against the use of their mark on related goods like hats or ladies' shoes [10]. Under Republic Act No. 166, Section 4(d), goods do not need to possess the same descriptive properties to bar registration; the controlling factor is the likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception [11], [12]. Since the marks "FLORMANN" and "FLORMEN" are admittedly confusingly similar, and shoes and clothing are related goods, Maliwat as the prior adopter has the better right [12].

The appealed decision is affirmed [13].
