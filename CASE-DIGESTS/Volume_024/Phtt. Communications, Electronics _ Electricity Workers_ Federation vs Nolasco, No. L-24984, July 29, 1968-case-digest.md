I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONICS & ELECTRICITY WORKERS' FEDERATION (PCWF) and ELIGIO GALVEZ v. THE HON. JUDGE RAMON O. NOLASCO, AVEGON, INCORPORATED, and JOAQUIN L. GONZALES, G.R. No. L-24984, July 29, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Union (PCWF) filed a petition for certification election with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR). Subsequently, respondent Avegon, Inc. laid off 70 employees, including 27 union members, allegedly due to business depression. The Union filed Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges with the CIR regarding these dismissals and staged a strike and picket at the company premises.

Avegon filed a complaint for damages with a prayer for preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Nolasco. Avegon alleged the strike was illegal and employed force and intimidation. The Union moved to dismiss, arguing the CFI lacked jurisdiction as the case involved a labor dispute cognizable by the CIR. Judge Nolasco denied the motion and issued a writ of preliminary injunction without hearing witnesses in open court or finding facts as required by the Industrial Peace Act. The Union filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the subject matter.
2. W/N the writ of preliminary injunction was validly issued.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court of First Instance lacks jurisdiction. The complaint alleged facts—a strike protesting the dismissal of union members—that clearly constitute a labor dispute involving unfair labor practices. The Court held that the criterion for CIR jurisdiction is "whether the acts complained of in the petition for injunction arose out of, or are connected or interwoven with, the unfair labor practice case" [1]. Since the strike and picketing arose from the ULP charges filed in the CIR, the matter falls within the CIR's exclusive competence. The claim for damages does not confer jurisdiction on the CFI because it is interwoven with the legality of the strike, which must be litigated in the ULP case [2].

2. **NO.** The writ of preliminary injunction is void for failure to comply with the strict requirements of Section 9(d) of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875). The trial court failed to: (1) hear the testimony of witnesses in open court; (2) make specific findings of fact regarding unlawful acts and substantial injury; (3) notify the chief public official charged with protecting the complainant's property; and (4) verify if the complainant exerted every reasonable effort to settle the dispute [3, 4]. Failure to comply with even one of these requirements suffices to deny the writ (*Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Toledo*) [4].

Petition granted. The CFI is directed to dismiss Civil Case No. 60864.
