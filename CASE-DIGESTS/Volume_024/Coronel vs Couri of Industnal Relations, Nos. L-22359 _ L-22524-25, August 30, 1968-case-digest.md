I. CAPTION
MATEO CORONEL, SANTIAGO SALVADOR and VICENTE BERTULANO v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and COLUMBIAN ROPE EMPLOYEES AND LABORERS ASSOCIATION, G.R. Nos. L-22359 & L-22524-25, August 30, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Union filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges against Columbian Rope Company (Columbian) and petitioners (Coronel, Salvador, and Bertulano), alleging violation of a return-to-work agreement following a strike. The CIR Trial Judge ruled in favor of the Union, ordering "respondents" to reinstate the workers with backwages. Columbian and petitioners filed separate motions for reconsideration. The CIR *en banc* granted Columbian's motion, ruling that no employer-employee relationship existed between the company and the strikers, and that petitioners were the actual employers as "independent contractors." The CIR *en banc* did not explicitly rule on petitioners' motion. Petitioners did not appeal, and the judgment became final as to them. After the Supreme Court denied the Union's appeal to hold Columbian liable, the Union sought execution of the judgment against petitioners. Petitioners opposed, arguing the *en banc* resolution set aside the judgment and that the Union was estopped.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N petitioners are liable for unfair labor practice under the CIR judgment.
2. W/N the Union is estopped from enforcing the judgment against petitioners after previously arguing Columbian was the employer.
3. W/N the order of reinstatement and backwages can be executed against petitioners.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR *en banc* resolution only modified the Trial Judge's decision by absolving Columbian; it impliedly denied petitioners' motion. Although petitioners were independent contractors, they are liable because they participated in the ULP. They were present when the company manager refused to readmit the strikers and "gave a sign" for them to get out, thereby acquiescing in and approving the act [1].

2. **NO.** Estoppel is not favored in law, especially when it excludes the truth of a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Union, by enforcing the judgment against petitioners, was merely bowing to the inevitable judicial authority of the previous Supreme Court decision which ruled that Columbian was not the employer [2, 3].

3. **NO (as to Reinstatement); YES (as to Backwages).** Reinstatement refers to restoration to a state from which one has been removed (*San Miguel Brewery v. Santos*). Here, reinstatement is impossible because the jobs were with Columbian, which has been absolved of liability. Petitioners cannot compel Columbian to accept the workers [4, 5]. However, to promote social justice, petitioners must pay backwages to the laborers for the wrong done to them.

The petition is GRANTED in part (declaring the reinstatement order void) and DENIED in part (affirming the order for backwages).
