I. CAPTION
VICENTE ARRIETA v. MALAYAN SAWMILL COMPANY, MASINLOC SAWMILL COMPANY, SEE KIONG and ONG LIAN KUAY, G.R. No. L-24140, July 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Vicente Arrieta filed a complaint against defendants Malayan Sawmill Company, et al., to collect a sum of money and compel compliance with a log delivery contract. On May 2, 1964, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement, which the trial court approved and rendered judgment upon on the same day.

Shortly thereafter, Arrieta filed a motion to set aside the decision, alleging that the defendants violated a simultaneous unwritten "gentleman's agreement"—omitted from the written compromise to avoid Anti-Dummy Act liability—wherein defendants undertook to immediately haul the logs to prevent deterioration. Arrieta claimed his consent was secured through fraud as defendants had no intention to comply. The trial court granted the motion, set aside the judgment on compromise, and set the case for trial on the merits. Defendants appealed, arguing the judgment on compromise was immediately final, executory, and *res judicata*.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the order setting aside the judgment on compromise and setting the case for trial is appealable.
2. W/N a judgment based on a compromise agreement may be set aside for fraud or non-compliance.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that the order is **interlocutory** and not appealable. Since the original judgment was set aside and the case was set for trial on the merits, there is "no decision or order disposing finally of the case." An interlocutory order leaves something to be done in the trial court and cannot be the subject of an appeal until a final judgment is rendered [1].

2. **YES.** While a decision rendered in pursuance of a compromise agreement is final and executory upon rendition, it may be set aside and the case reinstated to its *status quo ante* when the agreement is tainted with fraud, mistake, or duress, or when one of the parties fails or refuses to comply with it [2]. The Court found that the defendants impliedly admitted the existence and violation of the unwritten "gentleman's agreement" by failing to deny the allegations, and the trial judge confirmed the same [2, 3]. Consequently, the principle of *res judicata* does not apply because the decision upon which it relies was validly set aside and was assailed on the ground of fraud [2].

**Order affirmed.**
