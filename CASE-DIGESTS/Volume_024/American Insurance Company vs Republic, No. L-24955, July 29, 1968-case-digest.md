I. CAPTION
AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES and BUREAU OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24955, July 29, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
American Insurance Company filed a suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 60551) to recover the value of cargoes consigned to the San Miguel Corporation. The cargoes were allegedly lost in 1964 while in the possession of the Bureau of Customs, which was operating the "arrastre" service [1]. The trial court issued an order dismissing the case, prompting American Insurance Company to appeal to the Supreme Court [1, 2].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Republic of the Philippines and the Bureau of Customs are immune from suit regarding their operation of the arrastre service.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the dismissal, reiterating the doctrine settled in *Mobil Philippines Exploration, Inc. vs. Customs Arrastre Service* (1966) and subsequent jurisprudence [3]. The Court held that the Bureau of Customs Arrastre Service performs a necessary incident to the primary governmental function of assessing and collecting lawful taxes and revenues [3]. As such, neither the Bureau nor the Republic can be sued for these operations without the State's consent due to the doctrine of immunity from suit [3, 4]. The claimant's proper remedy is to file a claim with the Auditor General under Commonwealth Act No. 327 [4, 5].

The appealed order of dismissal is AFFIRMED [5].
