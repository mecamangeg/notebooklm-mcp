I. CAPTION
BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC. v. HON. JOSE R. QUERUBIN, JULIO & JULIANA DE LA RAMA, and NAPOLEON GONZAGA, G.R. No. L-29223, August 30, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Julio and Juliana de la Rama and Napoleon Gonzaga (Landowners) own parcels of land traversed by railway tracks used by petitioner Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. (Central) to haul sugar cane. The tracks were constructed under 1920 and 1936 milling contracts, which granted the Central a right of way. These contracts expired on September 30, 1965. On December 29, 1967, the Landowners filed a complaint for injunction to restrain the Central from using the tracks, alleging that the continued use after the contract expiration caused them irreparable injury. The Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental issued an *ex parte* preliminary injunction.

The Central moved to lift the injunction, arguing, among others, that the right of way was a conveyance in fee simple or a donation; that the 45-year period had not truly expired due to war years; and that under Article 448 of the Civil Code, it was a builder in good faith entitled to payment for improvements. The trial court denied the motion to lift the injunction. The Central filed this petition for certiorari, alleging grave abuse of discretion.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Central is entitled to a compulsory legal easement or continued use of the railway tracks after the expiration of the milling contracts.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the Central is not entitled to the use of the tracks. The Court relied on its recent decision in *Angela Estate, et al. v. CFI of Negros Occidental* (G.R. No. L-27084, July 31, 1968), which involved a similar factual setting and identical legal issues raised by the same Central. In that case, the Court resolved all issues against Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., ruling that the expiration of the milling contracts terminated the contractual right of way. Furthermore, the Central failed to demonstrate that the statutory preconditions required by **Articles 649 and 650 of the New Civil Code** for the grant of a legal easement actually existed. Consequently, the respondent court acted correctly in issuing the injunction and refusing to lift it.

The petition is **DISMISSED**.
