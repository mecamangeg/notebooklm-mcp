I. CAPTION
MERCEDES RUTH COBB-PEREZ and DAMASO P. PEREZ v. HON. GREGORIO LANTIN, RICARDO P. HERMOSO and the CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, G.R. No. L-22320, July 29, 1968, 24 SCRA 291, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
In a decision promulgated on May 22, 1968, the Supreme Court assessed treble costs against petitioners Mercedes Ruth Cobb-Perez and Damaso Perez, explicitly ordering that these be paid by their counsels. Attys. Crispin D. Baizas and A. N. Bolinao, counsels for the petitioners, filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration. While submitting to the judgment on the merits, they sought reconsideration regarding the adverse reflection on their professional conduct and the condemnation to pay the costs.

The record revealed a "protracted litigation" involving Civil Case No. 39407 (CFI Manila). Petitioners, assisted by counsel, resorted to a series of "quixotic maneuvers" to thwart the execution of a simple money judgment which had been final for over eight years. These tactics included: (1) attacking the execution piecemeal, causing six postponements of the sale; (2) filing Civil Case 7532 in CFI Rizal to enjoin the execution ordered by CFI Manila, a court of coordinate jurisdiction; (3) simultaneously filing a motion to lift the writ in the main case (CFI Manila) on the same grounds; (4) filing another injunction suit (Civil Case 55292) in CFI Manila Branch XXII to restrain Branch VII; and (5) making unfulfilled promises to replace levied stocks with cash dividends.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the counsels for the petitioners should be held liable for treble costs for employing dilatory tactics.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court denied the motion and affirmed the imposition of treble costs, modifying the decision to hold Attys. Crispin D. Baizas and A.N. Bolinao, Jr. jointly and severally liable.

The Court held that it is the duty of counsel to advise their client on the merit or lack of merit of the case. If a client's cause is defenseless, it is the lawyer's bounden duty to advise the client to acquiesce rather than traverse the incontrovertible [1, 2]. A lawyer must resist the whims and caprices of the client and temper their propensity to litigate [1, 2]. The lawyer's oath to uphold the cause of justice is superior to the duty to the client [1-3].

The Court found that the counsels actively participated in a strategy to foil the lawful execution of a judgment. They filed injunctions in courts lacking jurisdiction, violating the settled doctrine that courts have no power to restrain acts outside their territorial jurisdiction (*Acosta v. Alvendia*) or interfere with the decree of a court of concurrent jurisdiction (*Cabigao v. Del Rosario*) [4-6]. Counsel's insistence despite the patent futility of the client's position cannot be countenanced [3].

Accordingly, the Motion for Partial Reconsideration was denied, and the decision was modified to specify the liability of the counsels [7].
