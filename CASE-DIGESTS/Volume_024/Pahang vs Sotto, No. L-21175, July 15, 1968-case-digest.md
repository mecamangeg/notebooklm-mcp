I. CAPTION
PASCUALA SOTTO PAHANG v. FILEMON SOTTO, now deceased, substituted by Marcelo Sotto, G.R. No. L-21175, July 15, 1968, 24 SCRA 89, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff-appellee Pascuala Sotto Pahang was born in 1913 to Remedios Duterte and defendant-appellant Filemon Sotto, who were both single and free to marry at the time of her conception [1, 2]. Filemon treated Pascuala as his child, giving her the name "Pascuala" (after his mother) and his surname "Sotto," paying for her nursemaid, education, and board, and allowing her family to live on his properties rent-free [1, 3, 4]. Filemon's wife, Carmen Rallos, also treated Pascuala affectionately as a daughter [4, 5]. In 1960, Pascuala filed a suit for compulsory recognition [6]. Filemon answered the complaint but was subsequently declared incompetent and placed under guardianship; he died while the case was pending appeal in the Supreme Court and was substituted by his administrator [7, 8]. The Court of First Instance of Cebu ruled in favor of Pascuala, declaring her an acknowledged natural child [9]. The defendant appealed, raising issues of fact, laches, and improper prosecution against guardians [10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the plaintiff established continuous possession of the status of an acknowledged natural child.
2. W/N the action for recognition is barred by laches.
3. W/N the proceedings were invalid because they were prosecuted against the defendant's guardians rather than the defendant personally.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Article 269 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff is a natural child because her parents had no impediment to marry at the time of her conception [2]. Furthermore, under Article 283, the father is obliged to recognize the child when she is in continuous possession of the status of a child by the direct acts of the father or his family [11]. The evidence is overwhelming that Filemon treated her as his daughter continuously, including paying for her and her children's education and presenting her to friends and relatives as his child [4, 12].

2. **NO.** Article 285 of the Civil Code expressly provides that the action for recognition may be brought during the lifetime of the presumed parents [13]. An action for recognition, if brought during the lifetime of the parent, is imprescriptible because the status of persons is outside the commerce of man and cannot be acquired or lost by prescription [13]. Consequently, laches is no defense in an action for recognition filed during the parent's lifetime [14, 15].

3. **NO.** The requirement to bring the action during the parent's lifetime is to ensure they are heard [8]. Filemon Sotto had this opportunity: he was served, filed an answer, and was represented by counsel throughout the trial even after being declared incompetent [8]. Even if prosecuting the case against the guardians was an error, it was harmless and did not prejudice the defendant's substantial rights [16].

Judgment affirmed [16].
