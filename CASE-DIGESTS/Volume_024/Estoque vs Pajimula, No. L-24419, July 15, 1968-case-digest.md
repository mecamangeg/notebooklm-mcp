I. CAPTION
LEONORA ESTOQUE v. ELENA M. PAJIMULA, assisted by her husband CIRIACO PAJIMULA, G.R. No. L-24419, July 15, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Lot No. 802 of the Rosario Cadastre was originally owned by the late spouses Rosendo Perez and Fortunata Bernal, survived by their children Crispina, Lorenzo, and Ricardo. On October 28, 1951, Crispina Perez sold her 1/3 right and participation to petitioner Leonora Estoque. The deed of sale specified that the object sold was the "southeastern third portion" of Lot 802 with an area of 840 sq. m.

The following day, October 29, 1951, Crispina acquired the remaining shares of her co-heirs (Lorenzo and the heirs of Ricardo) via an extrajudicial settlement, making her the sole owner of the entire Lot 802. Years later, on December 30, 1959, Crispina sold the remaining 2/3 "western portion" of the lot to respondent Elena Pajimula.

Estoque filed a complaint for legal redemption against Pajimula, arguing that the initial sale to her by a co-owner (Crispina) only conveyed an undivided share, making her a co-owner of the whole lot. She claimed that when Crispina sold the rest to Pajimula, she had a right to redeem under Article 1620 of the Civil Code. The Court of First Instance of La Union dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, ruling that the lots were distinct and segregated, hence no co-ownership existed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Estoque is a co-owner entitled to exercise the right of legal redemption against Pajimula.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Estoque never became a co-owner of Pajimula.

The deed of sale to Estoque clearly specified the object sold as the **southeastern third portion** of Lot 802. While the sale of a specific portion by a co-owner might have been initially ineffective for lack of authority, the transaction was validated and became fully effective when the vendor, Crispina, became the sole owner of Lot 802 the very next day.

The Court applied **Article 1434 of the Civil Code**, which states: "When a person who is not the owner of a thing sells or alienates and delivers it, and later the seller or grantor acquires title thereto, such title passes by operation of law to the buyer or grantee." Consequently, Estoque became the actual owner of the southeastern third on October 29, 1951. Since Estoque owned the southeastern third and Pajimula owned the western two-thirds, their respective portions were distinct and separate. Without co-ownership, the right of legal redemption under Article 1620 does not apply.

The order of dismissal is affirmed.
