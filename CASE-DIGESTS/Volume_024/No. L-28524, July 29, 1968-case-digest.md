I. CAPTION
ERNESTO NAVARRO, et al. v. HON. TITO V. TIZON, THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, et al., G.R. No. L-28524, July 29, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Following the November 14, 1967 elections in Orion, Bataan, the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) initially proclaimed Gabriel Manrique (Liberal Party) as Mayor. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) nullified this proclamation due to the illegal constitution of the Board and ordered a reconstitution. The reconstituted MBC, chaired by petitioner Ernesto Navarro, suspended the canvass for mayor and councilors after observing erasures, superimpositions, and illegible entries in the election returns (specifically the copies intended for the Municipal Treasurer). Navarro filed a petition for judicial recount under Section 163 of the Revised Election Code with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bataan (Judge Tizon), alleging these irregularities.

Meanwhile, COMELEC relieved Navarro for failing to complete the canvass and appointed a new chairman. The MBC continued the canvass using COMELEC’s authentic photostatic copies to verify the returns, leading to a second proclamation of Manrique. The CFI dismissed the petition for judicial recount, finding that the alleged discrepancies were merely innocuous corrections (e.g., retracing light entries, alphabetizing names) that matched the COMELEC's copies. Petitioners filed a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court challenging the CFI's refusal to order a recount and the validity of the COMELEC's transfer of the canvass venue to Manila and the subsequent proclamation.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N a judicial recount is proper based on erasures and superimpositions appearing on only one copy of the election returns.
2. W/N the Commission on Elections acted within its authority in transferring the venue of the canvass and substituting recalcitrant board members.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** A judicial recount is a special remedy available only in specific circumstances. Under Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code, a judicial recount is proper only "in case of contradictions or discrepancies between the copies or 'other authentic copies' of the statement or return from an election precinct," or when the return is clearly falsified on its face. The "other authentic copies" refer to the four specific copies required by law (for the ballot box, municipal treasurer, provincial treasurer, and COMELEC).

The Court held that erasures or superimpositions on one copy (the Municipal Treasurer's copy) do not, by themselves, justify a recount if they are susceptible of a reasonable explanation and do not contradict the other authentic copies. Here, the respondent Judge correctly compared the questioned returns with the authentic photostatic copies from the COMELEC and found no discrepancies affecting the result. The erasures were merely corrections to make entries legible or to correct the alphabetical listing of candidates. Allegations of fraud indicated by such erasures must be ventilated in an election protest, not in a summary proceeding for judicial recount [1-8].

2. **YES.** The COMELEC is the body vested by the Constitution with the power to insure free and orderly elections. The Court ruled that the COMELEC did not abuse its discretion in ordering the transfer of the canvass to Manila due to the tense situation in Orion [9]. Furthermore, the suspension and substitution of the petitioners (recalcitrant board members) were justified because they refused to sign the proclamation and unnecessarily delayed the completion of the canvass in defiance of COMELEC orders [10-13].

Petitions dismissed.
