I. CAPTION
KAPISANAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA MANILA RAILROAD COMPANY v. HERNANDEZ, G.R. No. L-19791, August 14, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Hernandez, et al. challenged the validity of the Union’s (Kapisanan) collection of increased monthly dues. The Supreme Court initially remanded the case to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to allow respondents to cross-examine union officers regarding a certification alleging the regularity of the resolutions authorizing the increase. Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration, waiving their right to cross-examine and verify the facts to avoid delay. They argued that even assuming the resolutions were genuine, Resolution No. 1, which increased dues from P2.00 to P5.00, was void. Section 1, Article VI of the Union's Constitution fixed the dues at P2.00. Section 6, Article X required a 2/3 vote of the convention delegates to amend the Constitution. It was admitted that Resolution No. 1 was passed by only a mere majority of the convention members.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the increase in union dues via Resolution No. 1 was validly enacted.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The increase in dues from P2.00 to P5.00 constitutes an amendment to the Union's Constitution and By-laws. Under the Union's own organic law (Section 6, Article X), any amendment to the Constitution requires the approval of 2/3 of the convention delegates [1]. Since Resolution No. 1 was passed by only a mere majority, it failed to meet the required vote and was illegally enacted [2]. Consequently, the Court granted the Motion for Reconsideration in part, affirming the CIR en banc resolution which ordered the Union to stop the P5.00 collection and to refund the additional fees collected from members [3].
