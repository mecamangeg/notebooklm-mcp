I. CAPTION
FLORENCIO REYES and ANGEL REYES v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. Nos. L-24020-21, July 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On October 31, 1950, petitioners Florencio and Angel Reyes (father and son) purchased a lot and building known as the Gibbs Building for P835,000.00. They paid a down payment of P375,000.00, shared equally, and assumed a mortgage obligation of P460,000.00 [1, 2]. The building was leased to various tenants, and its administration was entrusted to an administrator who collected rents, kept books, negotiated leases, and made repairs [1, 2]. Petitioners divided the net income from the operation equally [2].

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed petitioners for income tax, surcharges, and compromise penalties for the years 1951 to 1956, treating them as a corporation/partnership [3]. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), arguing they were mere co-owners who intended to eventually house their respective enterprises in the building and divide it after 10 years [4-6]. The CTA affirmed the CIR's theory that they formed a partnership subject to corporate tax but reduced the liability by eliminating surcharges [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N petitioners established a partnership subject to income tax on corporations under the National Internal Revenue Code.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court affirmed the CTA's decision, applying the doctrine in *Evangelista v. Collector of Internal Revenue* [8, 9]. Under Section 24 and Section 84(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code, the term "corporation" includes partnerships "no matter how created or organized," excluding only duly registered general copartnerships [6, 10]. Legal personality is not a requirement for an entity to be taxed as a corporation under the Code [11].

The Court found the essential elements of a partnership were present: (a) an agreement to contribute money to a common fund, and (b) an intent to divide the profits [12]. The petitioners created a common fund not just for one transaction but for a series of transactions (leasing) managed by an administrator for over 10 years [13]. Although petitioners claimed an intent to divide the property, no division occurred even after 15 years, and the building continued to be leased to third parties for profit [5, 14]. These facts established their intent to engage in business for monetary gain, subjecting them to corporate income tax [11, 12].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is AFFIRMED [15].
