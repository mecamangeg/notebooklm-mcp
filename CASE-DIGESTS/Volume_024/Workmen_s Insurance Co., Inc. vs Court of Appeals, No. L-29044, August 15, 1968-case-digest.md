I. CAPTION
WORKMEN'S INSURANCE CO., INC. v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, CARMEN BAUTISTA, and PRIMO ZUÑIGA, G.R. No. L-29044, August 15, 1968, Fernando, J. [1]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Workmen's Insurance Co., Inc. filed a petition for review by certiorari of a decision rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 37848-R). While the petition was pending before the Supreme Court, the petitioner and private respondents Carmen Bautista and Primo Zuñiga submitted a Compromise Agreement. Under this agreement, the petitioner agreed to pay the respondents a total sum of P12,000.00 (P9,000.00 for principal and P3,000.00 for attorney's fees), which the respondents acknowledged receiving via checks. The respondents waived their right to collect interest, and both parties agreed that the Compromise Agreement would set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals. [1-3]

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Compromise Agreement submitted by the parties should be approved to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals. [2, 4]

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court approved the Compromise Agreement. Although the Court noted that the agreement was "awkwardly drafted," as the parties failed to correctly designate themselves and their capacities in the petition, it found no legal objection to its approval. The Court held that a duly approved compromise agreement may have the effect of setting aside a decision of the Court of Appeals. Since the rights of the parties are governed by the compromise and the respondents acknowledged receipt of the payment, leaving nothing further to be complied with, judgment was entered in accordance with the agreement.
