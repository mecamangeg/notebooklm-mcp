I. CAPTION
HOC HUAT TRADING v. HON. GUILLERMO S. SANTOS, THE CITY SHERIFF OF MANILA, et al., G.R. No. L-22663, July 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Loreto Gremio, a laborer, filed a claim for workmen's compensation against petitioner Hoc Huat Trading. On October 7, 1963, the Regional Office Hearing Officer rendered a decision awarding Gremio P765.35. Petitioner's counsel received notice of the award on October 14, 1963, but failed to file a petition for review within the 15-day statutory period, which expired on October 29, 1963.

On December 12, 1963, Gremio filed a case with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila, presided by respondent Judge Santos, for the enforcement of the award. Petitioner opposed, invoking Rule 38 (Relief from Judgment), alleging that the failure to appeal was due to the "oversight" of counsel who, for "reasons unknown," failed to inform the client of the decision. Simultaneously, petitioner filed a late motion for reconsideration with the Regional Office. Judge Santos issued a decree enforcing the award. Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari, arguing the Judge committed grave abuse of discretion as the award was not final due to the pending review at the Regional Office.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the award of the Hearing Officer had become final and executory despite the subsequent filing of a petition for review.
2. W/N the "oversight" of counsel constitutes excusable negligence under Rule 38 sufficient to set aside the award.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Under Section 49 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428), an award becomes final unless a petition for review is filed within 15 days after notice to the parties. Here, the period expired on October 29, 1963, without any action from the petitioner. Consequently, under Section 51 of the same Act, the court is commanded to render a decree or judgment in accordance with a decision from which no petition for review has been taken within the time allowed.

2. **NO.** The Court held that the "oversight" of counsel in failing to communicate the award to the client for "reasons unknown" does not constitute "fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence" required for relief under Rule 38. Rather, it is neglect that should be discouraged and condemned (citing *Echevarri v. Velasco* and *Valeriano v. Kerr*). Furthermore, the Court noted that the spirit of the Workmen's Compensation Act, which aims for the expeditious disposal of claims to assist incapacitated laborers, is incompatible with the delays resulting from the application of Rule 38.

Petition dismissed.
