I. CAPTION
GREGORIA PALANCA v. THE AMERICAN FOOD MANUFACTURING COMPANY and TIBURCIO EVALLE, G.R. No. L-22822, August 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On May 14, 1958, Gregoria Palanca applied to register the trademark "LION and representation" for food seasoning. The American Food Manufacturing Company opposed, claiming prior use since 1953. On June 14, 1961, the Director of Patents rendered a decision rejecting Palanca's application, finding the opposer was the prior user. Palanca's counsel, Atty. Medel, received a copy of the decision on June 16, 1961, but failed to notify Palanca or file an appeal within the reglementary period, resulting in the judgment becoming final.

On December 14, 1961, Palanca filed a petition to set aside the judgment under Section 2, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. She alleged fraud and negligence by her former counsel for keeping her ignorant of the proceedings and the adverse decision, which prevented her from appealing or presenting newly discovered evidence. She also claimed the respondent used falsified evidence regarding prior use. The Director of Patents denied the petition, ruling that no extrinsic fraud existed. Palanca appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the fraud or negligence of the petitioner's own counsel constitutes sufficient ground to set aside a final judgment.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that under Section 2 of Rule 38, a judgment may be set aside for fraud only if the fraud is **extrinsic or collateral**. Extrinsic fraud refers to fraudulent acts committed by the **successful party** (the opponent) outside the trial which prevent the defeated party from fully presenting their side of the case (e.g., keeping a party away from court).

In this case, the acts complained of—failure to file a memorandum, keeping the client ignorant of the proceedings, and failure to notify the client of the adverse decision—were committed by Palanca's own counsel, not by the respondent. The Court reiterated the rule that "negligence, mistake or fraud of one's own attorney is not a ground for granting a new trial" (*O'Quinn v. Tate*). A client is bound by the mistakes of their counsel in procedural matters, and notice to counsel is considered notice to the client (*Duran v. Pagarigan*). Furthermore, Palanca's claim that the respondent presented falsified evidence constitutes **intrinsic fraud**, which is not a ground to annul a judgment.

The appeal is **DISMISSED**, and the resolution of the Director of Patents is **AFFIRMED**.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS (if any)
