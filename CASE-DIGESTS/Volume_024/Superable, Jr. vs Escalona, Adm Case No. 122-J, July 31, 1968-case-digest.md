I. CAPTION
NICOLAS A. SUPERABLE, JR. v. HON. GODOFREDO ESCALONA, Adm. Case No. 122-J, July 31, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Complainant Nicolas A. Superable, Jr., City Judge of Tacloban City, filed an administrative complaint against respondent Judge Godofredo Escalona, Presiding Judge of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, Branch I [1]. Superable charged Escalona with: (1) inefficiency and falsification of public documents, alleging the judge held sessions for only one hour a day and failed to decide cases within 90 days (specifically Civil Case No. 3636), yet falsified service certificates to collect his salary [2]; and (2) serious misconduct, alleging Escalona allowed himself to be pressured by Congressman Marcelino R. Veloso to recommend a severe reprimand against Superable in a separate administrative investigation (Adm. Case No. 26) [3].

In his defense, Judge Escalona, who retired on January 12, 1968, denied the charges. He presented certifications from the Leyte Bar Association and the Clerk of Court proving he held regular sessions and that his case disposition output was comparable to other branches [4]. He attributed the delay in Civil Case No. 3636 to valid leaves of absence and lack of personnel [4, 5]. Both the respondent and Congressman Veloso denied the alleged pressure or influence [5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the respondent Judge is guilty of inefficiency and falsification of public documents.
2. W/N the respondent Judge is guilty of serious misconduct due to partiality or external influence.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found the charge of inefficiency unsustainable. Evidence showed the respondent's case output (disposing of 224, 291, and 188 cases in consecutive fiscal years) compared favorably with other branches of the Court of First Instance in his district [6]. The delay in Civil Case No. 3636 was satisfactorily explained by his sick and vacation leaves, and the charge of falsification was deemed a mere presumption without factual basis [7].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that the charge of serious misconduct could not be entertained. The alleged pressure by the Congressman was vehemently denied by the parties and witnesses [7]. Even assuming the respondent made findings of fact not supported by evidence in the investigation of the complainant, such would merely constitute an error of judgment. Absent proof that the actuation was due to an intention to violate the law or disregard well-known rules, it does not constitute serious misconduct (In re Impeachment of Horilleno, 43 Phil. 212) [7]. The Court noted that charges of partiality are to be expected from disgruntled lawyers or respondents in administrative cases (In re Impeachment of Flordeliza, 44 Phil. 608) [7].

The complaint was **DISMISSED** [8].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Concepcion (C.J.), J.B.L. Reyes, Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Angeles, and Fernando concurred. Justice Castro took no part [8].
