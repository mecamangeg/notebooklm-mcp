I. CAPTION
**THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. SIMPLICIO S. GERVACIO, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21965, August 30, 1968, Per Curiam.**

II. FACTS
On August 30, 1963, in Quezon City, accused Simplicio Gervacio (the houseboy) and Atanacio Mocorro conspired to rob the house of Dr. Vicente Obando. Armed with a sledgehammer, they brutally killed Dr. Obando, his wife Esperanza, his mother-in-law Candida Umali, and the housemaid Maria Magpantay. They ransacked the house and took money, jewelry, and a pistol. The crime was witnessed by 9-year-old Luzviminda Obando, whom the accused took with them when they fled to Leyte. Gervacio eventually surrendered to the Mayor of Biliran twelve days later, while Mocorro was arrested.

The Court of First Instance of Rizal convicted both accused of Robbery with Quadruple Homicide and sentenced them to death. Gervacio pleaded guilty but invoked the mitigating circumstances of passion and obfuscation (claiming he was scolded and unpaid) and voluntary surrender. Mocorro pleaded not guilty, claiming he acted under the exempting circumstance of uncontrollable fear because Gervacio held a gun.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Mocorro acted under the exempting circumstance of uncontrollable fear.
2. W/N Gervacio is entitled to the mitigating circumstances of passion and obfuscation and voluntary surrender.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstances of disregard of age and sex, and abuse of superior strength, should be considered independently of treachery.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Fear or duress, to be a valid defense, must be based on real, imminent, or reasonable fear for one's life or limb. The Court found that the fear harbored by Mocorro was merely imaginary, as there was no evidence that Gervacio ever pointed the gun at him to secure his cooperation. Mocorro was a willing participant who struck victims with the sledgehammer without compulsion.

2. **NO.** Regarding **passion and obfuscation**, the act producing such condition must not be far removed from the commission of the crime by a considerable length of time (*People v. Alanguilang*). Gervacio failed to prove that the alleged scolding or non-payment of wages occurred recently enough to prevent him from recovering his normal equanimity. Regarding **voluntary surrender**, it must be spontaneous and show an intent to submit unconditionally (*People v. Sakam*). Gervacio fled to Leyte and only surrendered after 12 days when his escape seemed impossible, not to save authorities trouble or acknowledge guilt.

3. **YES.** Where the aggravating circumstance of treachery is already considered, the circumstances of disregard of age and sex, and advantage taken of superior strength, are deemed included and should not be considered independently (*People v. Limaco*). However, even without these, the remaining aggravating circumstances (treachery, evident premeditation, dwelling) against Gervacio were not offset by his lone mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty.

**Decision affirmed.** The death penalty is imposed on both accused.
