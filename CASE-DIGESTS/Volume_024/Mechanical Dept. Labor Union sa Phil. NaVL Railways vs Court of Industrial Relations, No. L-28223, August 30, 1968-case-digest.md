I. CAPTION
MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT LABOR UNION SA PHILIPPINE NATIONAL RAILWAYS v. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS and SAMAHAN NG MGA MANGGAGAWA SA CALOOCAN SHOPS, G.R. No. L-28223, August 30, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On February 13, 1965, respondent union "Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Caloocan Shops" (Samahan) petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) to be recognized as a separate bargaining unit for the workers of the Caloocan Shops of the Philippine National Railways (PNR). Petitioner Mechanical Department Labor Union (MDLU), the existing exclusive bargaining agent for the PNR Mechanical Department, opposed the petition, arguing it already had a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with management and that Samahan was composed mainly of supervisors.

The CIR found that while the Caloocan Shops were part of the Mechanical Department, its workers performed major repairs involving heavy equipment and machineries, distinct from the minor repairs performed by other workers in the Manila sheds. Citing the history of PNR bargaining units being split into smaller groups (e.g., engine crew, train crew) and the "Globe doctrine," the CIR ordered a plebiscite to determine if the Caloocan Shops workers desired to be separated from the MDLU. MDLU appealed, questioning the applicability of the Globe doctrine.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the CIR correctly applied the "Globe doctrine" in ordering a plebiscite to determine the proper bargaining unit for the Caloocan Shops workers.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CIR's order. Under the "Globe doctrine" (*Globe Machine & Stamping Co.*, 3 NLRB 294), bargaining units may be formed through the separation of new units from existing ones whenever plebiscites show the workers' desire to have their own representatives.

The Court held that the appeal was technically premature, as the plebiscite results were not yet known. Nevertheless, on the merits, the Court found no grave abuse of discretion. The CIR's factual findings established that the Caloocan Shops workers had a distinct community of interest and required special skills for major repairs using heavy equipment. Furthermore, under Republic Act No. 875, the CIR has discretion in determining the representation of employee groups (*Manila Paper Mills Employees & Workers' Association v. C.I.R.*). The Court also ruled that the existing CBAs, having been in existence for over two years, did not bar the determination of a new bargaining representative (*PLDT Employees' Union v. PLDT*).

Petition denied. Order affirmed.
