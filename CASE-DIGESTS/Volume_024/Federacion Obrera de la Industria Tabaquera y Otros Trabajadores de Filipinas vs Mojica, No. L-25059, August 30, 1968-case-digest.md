I. CAPTION
**FEDERACION OBRERA DE LA INDUSTRIA TABAQUERA Y OTROS TRABAJADORES DE FILIPINAS (FOITAF) v. THE HON. ANGEL MOJICA and LIWAYWAY GAWGAW AND COFFEE REPACKING**, G.R. No. L-25059, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 936, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
On July 12, 1965, respondent Liwayway Gawgaw and Coffee Repacking filed a complaint for damages with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction against petitioner Federacion Obrera de la Industria Tabaquera (FOITAF) before the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Pasay City, presided by respondent Judge Angel Mojica [1]. Judge Mojica granted the preliminary injunction on July 16, 1965 [1]. FOITAF filed a motion to dismiss and to quash the writ, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because the dispute involved unfair labor practices (ULP), citing two pending ULP cases (Nos. 502-ULP and 3972-ULP) before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [2]. Liwayway opposed, arguing that the pending matters were merely "charges" under preliminary investigation by CIR prosecutors and not actual "cases" before the CIR [3]. On August 28, 1965, Judge Mojica denied the motion to dismiss, asserting jurisdiction based on the averments in the complaint [2, 4]. FOITAF filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction to issue an injunction in a labor dispute involving unfair labor practice charges pending before the Court of Industrial Relations.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court of First Instance has no jurisdiction. Unfair labor practice cases fall within the exclusive competence of the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) [5, 6]. The Supreme Court held that even if no unfair labor practice suit has been formally filed in the CIR, the CFI still lacks jurisdiction to issue a restraining order if it is shown that the labor dispute arose out of unfair labor practices [7, 8].

The Court rejected the respondent's argument distinguishing between an unfair labor practice "charge" and a "complaint." Citing *Philippine Communications, Electronics & Electricity Workers' Association v. Nolasco*, the Court ruled that CIR jurisdiction remains even if only a charge exists, rendering such distinction irrelevant [9, 10]. The admission that the acts complained of constituted unfair labor practices was fatal to the respondent Judge's assumption of jurisdiction [3, 8].

**Petition GRANTED.** The orders of the respondent Judge are annulled, and he is ordered to desist from taking further action in the civil case [11, 12].
