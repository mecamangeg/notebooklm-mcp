I. CAPTION
LUZON STEVEDORING CORPORATION v. SALVADOR CELORIO and COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, G.R. No. L-22542, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 521, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Salvador Celorio, an engineer for petitioner Luzon Stevedoring Corporation since 1948, went on sick leave in March 1956. Upon recovery in April 1956, he sought to return to work, but petitioner refused to reinstate him. On May 23, 1956, Celorio filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila for reinstatement, overtime pay, and night differential. The CFI dismissed the case on October 7, 1958, ruling that jurisdiction belonged to the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR).

On October 13, 1958, Celorio filed a petition with the CIR involving the same causes of action. Petitioner moved to dismiss, alleging lack of jurisdiction and prescription. The CIR denied the motion and, after trial, rendered a decision granting overtime pay, night differential, and ordering reinstatement with back wages. Petitioner appealed, arguing the CIR lacked jurisdiction over the money claims, that the claims had prescribed, and that it could not order reinstatement without a finding of Unfair Labor Practice (ULP).

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the CIR has jurisdiction over the case.
2. W/N the CIR has the authority to order reinstatement and back wages absent a finding of Unfair Labor Practice.
3. W/N the money claims under the Eight-Hour Labor Law have prescribed.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The CIR has jurisdiction. Under the doctrine in *Campos v. Manila Railroad Co.*, the CIR acquires jurisdiction if (a) there is an employer-employee relationship or a prayer for reinstatement, and (b) the controversy involves a ULP, a certified case, or arises under the Eight-Hour Labor Law or Minimum Wage Law [1]. Here, Celorio’s petition contained a prayer for reinstatement and a claim for overtime compensation under the Eight-Hour Labor Law [2]. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint, and the prayer for reinstatement was found to be genuine, not a sham [3].

2. **NO.** The CIR cannot order reinstatement and back wages where the dismissal, although unjust, does not involve Unfair Labor Practice or a case certified by the President [4]. Following *National Labor Union v. Insular-Yebana*, the CIR’s authority to reinstate is confined to instances of arbitration and conciliation under CA 103 [4]. Under RA 1052 (Termination Pay Law), as amended by RA 1787, an employer may dismiss an employee without cause by serving notice or paying termination pay. Since Celorio was dismissed without just cause and without notice, he is entitled to **separation pay**, not reinstatement [5], [6].

3. **NO.** The claims have not prescribed. Section 7-A of CA 444 (Eight-Hour Labor Law), added by RA 1993, requires actions to be commenced within three years but provides a saving clause for "actions already commenced" before its effectivity [7]. Celorio filed his complaint with the CFI on May 23, 1956, before RA 1993 took effect [8]. Although the CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, the filing of the action interrupted the prescriptive period and satisfied the saving clause, consistent with the ruling in *A.L. Ammen Trans. Co. v. Borja* regarding the liberal construction of labor statutes [9], [10].

**Disposition:** Decision MODIFIED. The order for reinstatement and back wages is SET ASIDE; petitioner is ordered to pay respondent Celorio separation pay. The awards for overtime and night differential pay are AFFIRMED.
