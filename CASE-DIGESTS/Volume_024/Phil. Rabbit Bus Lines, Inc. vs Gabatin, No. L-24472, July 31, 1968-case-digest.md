I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE RABBIT BUS LINES, INC. v. GABATIN, G.R. No. L-24472, July 31, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Prospero Gabatin applied for a certificate of public convenience with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to operate an auto-truck service on the line Caoayan, Ilocos Sur to Grace Park, Caloocan City using six units [1]. He presented evidence, including testimony from the Municipal Mayor of Caoayan, that residents had to travel to Vigan to take buses, which were often fully loaded coming from Laoag, leaving passengers with no accommodation [2], [3]. Petitioner Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. opposed the application, arguing there was no need for the service, that existing operators were sufficient, and that Gabatin was not financially capable [4]. The PSC granted Gabatin's application, finding that a direct service would ease transportation problems and that Gabatin was financially capable [3], [5]. Petitioner appealed, challenging the sufficiency of evidence and invoking the "prior operator rule" [6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Supreme Court should disturb the PSC's findings of fact regarding public necessity and the applicant's financial capacity.
2. W/N the "prior operator rule" bars the grant of the certificate to the applicant.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court held that the findings and conclusions of fact by the PSC, after weighing conflicting evidence, are binding on the Supreme Court and will not be disturbed unless they appear not to be reasonably supported by evidence [7]. The record showed testimonies supporting the need for direct service from Caoayan [2], [3]. Regarding financial capacity, the Court cited *Sorita v. Public Service Commission*, stating that this is a factual determination that cannot be interfered with unless patently unsupported by evidence [8].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that while prior operators deserve protection from unnecessary competition, nobody has an exclusive right to secure a franchise [9]. The grant of a certificate should be guided primarily by public service and interest [9]. The evidence established that petitioner's buses passing through Vigan were usually full and did not serve the specific direct route applied for by Gabatin [3].

**WHEREFORE**, the decision of the Public Service Commission is affirmed. [10]
