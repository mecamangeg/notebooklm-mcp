I. CAPTION
THE RECEIVER FOR NORTH NEGROS SUGAR COMPANY, INC. v. PEDRO V. YBAÑEZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-22183, August 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On August 31, 1937, Cesar V. Ybañez died after the car he was riding in collided with a train owned by North Negros Sugar Co., Inc. at a railroad intersection in Manapla, Occidental Negros. The train operator and brakeman were acquitted in the subsequent criminal case for reckless imprudence. On May 15, 1940, Cesar’s brother and sister, Pedro and Rosario Ybañez (respondents), filed a civil action for damages based on *culpa aquiliana* against the company and its employees. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision, holding the company liable and awarding, among others, P5,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as attorney's fees. The company, substituted by its Receiver, appealed to the Supreme Court, questioning only the awards for moral damages and attorney's fees.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the brother of the deceased is entitled to moral damages for death caused by *quasi-delict*.
2. W/N the award of attorney's fees is proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that under Article 2206 of the New Civil Code, moral damages for death caused by *quasi-delict* are recoverable only by the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants, and ascendants of the deceased. Although the accident occurred in 1937 under the regime of the Old Civil Code (which theoretically allowed a broader scope of beneficiaries), the Court applied the New Civil Code because it provides a "less severe sanction" by limiting the persons entitled to such damages. Since the petitioner's liability is reduced under the New Code, this retroactivity favors the defendant. Consequently, the respondent, being merely a brother of the victim, is excluded from recovering moral damages (*Heirs of Gervacio Gonzales v. Alegarbes*).

2. **NO.** The civil action was instituted on May 15, 1940, prior to the effectivity of the New Civil Code. The Court held that Article 2208 of the New Civil Code, which allows for attorney's fees in certain instances, is not applicable to cases filed before the Code took effect (*Bureau of Lands v. Samia*). Instead, the jurisprudence prevailing at the time of the action, specifically *Tan Ti v. Alvear*, established that attorney's fees are not a proper element of damages. Furthermore, the petitioner did not act in gross bad faith in resisting the claim, as its employees had been acquitted in the criminal case.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is **MODIFIED** by deleting the awards for moral damages and attorney's fees.
