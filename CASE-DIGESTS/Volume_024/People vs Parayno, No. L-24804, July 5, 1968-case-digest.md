I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. MARCIANO PARAYNO and JOSE PARAYNO, G.R. No. L-24804, July 5, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On September 1, 1956, in San Carlos, Pangasinan, nine-year-old Rodrigo Fernandez and his cousins were gathering fruits from a tree near a river. The accused, Marciano Parayno (61 years old) and his son Jose, arrived and shouted at the boys, prompting them to flee. The cousins swam across the river, but Rodrigo, who could not swim, was left behind. Marciano caught up to Rodrigo and struck him with a piece of wood, hitting his neck. Prosecution witnesses testified at trial that upon Jose's suggestion to make it look like drowning, both accused rolled Rodrigo's body into the river, where he died. The autopsy revealed a neck injury and signs of asphyxia by drowning. The Court of First Instance of Pangasinan convicted both accused of Murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Jose Parayno is guilty of the crime charged.
2. W/N the crime committed by Marciano Parayno is Murder.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Jose Parayno is acquitted on reasonable doubt. The Court found that in the initial affidavits and preliminary investigation, the prosecution witnesses (the victim's father and cousins) only implicated Marciano and made no mention of Jose's participation or the act of rolling the body into the river [1]. This material detail only appeared during the trial, suggesting it was an afterthought [2]. Where inculpatory facts are capable of two explanations, one consistent with innocence, the evidence fails the test of moral certainty required for conviction [3].

2. **NO.** Marciano Parayno is guilty only of **Homicide**. The Court ruled that **evident premeditation** was not present as there was no evidence Marciano conceived the thought to kill or had time to reflect on his actions [4]. **Abuse of superior strength** was also ruled out despite the age difference (61 vs. 9) under the peculiar circumstances of the case [5]. Although the evidence regarding the intentional rolling of the body was doubtful, Marciano remains criminally liable for the consequences of his unlawful act of beating the child, which proximately led to the victim falling into the water and drowning [3].

Judgment is modified. Jose Parayno is acquitted. Marciano Parayno is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of *reclusion temporal*.
