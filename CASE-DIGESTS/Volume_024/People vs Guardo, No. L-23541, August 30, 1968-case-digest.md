I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ANGELITO GUARDO, CATALINO GIPAL and MAXILIANO GIPAL, G.R. No. L-23541, August 30, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
The victim, Apolinario Edradan, and appellant Maxiliano Gipal had a history of quarrels, leading Maxiliano to file a slight physical injuries case against Edradan which was subsequently dismissed [1, 2]. On the evening of December 9, 1963, appellant Catalino Gipal and a companion invited Edradan to meet Maxiliano at a place called Riverside [2]. However, before reaching the location, the group assaulted Edradan at Gonzales Street [3]. Prosecution witnesses testified that Maxiliano hit the victim with a paddle on the neck, Catalino stabbed him with a small bolo on the arm, and appellant Angelito Guardo stabbed him multiple times in the chest [3, 4]. Edradan died from the wounds [3].

The Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte convicted Guardo, Catalino, and Maxiliano of murder, sentencing Guardo to life imprisonment and the Gipals to indeterminate sentences [5, 6]. The appellants appealed, challenging the credibility of witnesses and arguing that Guardo was the sole author of the crime [7, 8].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appellants conspired to commit the murder of Edradan.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court held that conspiracy was duly proven by the coordinated acts of the accused. The conspiracy was evident when Catalino invited the victim to a specific location upon Maxiliano's direction, and the group subsequently launched a simultaneous assault using different weapons [9, 10]. The Court rejected Guardo's admission that he was the sole killer, ruling it was merely an attempt to save his co-appellants [11, 12]. This claim was physically belied by the presence of multiple wounds on the victim caused by different types of weapons (paddle and bolos), consistent with the participation of multiple attackers [10-12].

Furthermore, the motive was well-established by the prior quarrels and the dismissed court case between Maxiliano and the victim [1, 8]. The inconsistencies in witness testimony cited by the appellants were deemed insufficient to weaken the prosecution's case [9, 10].

The decision of the lower court is **AFFIRMED with modification** [13, 14].
