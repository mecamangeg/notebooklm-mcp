I. CAPTION
ANGELA ESTATE, INC., and FERNANDO F. GONZAGA, INC. v. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, BACOLOD-MURCIA MILLING CO., INC., and THE BACOLOD-MURCIA SUGAR FARMERS CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-27084, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 500, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners Angela Estate, Inc. and Fernando F. Gonzaga, Inc. (Landowners) own Hacienda Helvetia. Respondent Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. (Central) operates a sugar mill. In 1936, the Landowners' predecessors entered into amended milling contracts with the Central, granting the Central a right of way for railroad tracks over the Hacienda for 45 years, starting from the 1920-1921 crop year.

When the contracts expired at the end of the 1964-1965 crop year, the Landowners demanded the removal of the railroad tracks and threatened to block the Central's passage. The Central filed a complaint with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental for a legal easement of right of way and a preliminary injunction. The Central argued that the right of way was indispensable for its operations and that it was willing to pay indemnity. The CFI issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the Landowners from removing the tracks or impeding passage. The Landowners filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the injunction was improperly issued because the Central failed to show a clear and unmistakable right to the relief demanded.

The Court held that the Central's contractual right of way had indisputably expired after the 1964-1965 crop year. To claim a compulsory legal easement under Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code, the Central needed to prove four requisites: (1) the estate is surrounded by other immovables without adequate outlet to a public highway; (2) payment of proper indemnity; (3) the isolation was not due to the proprietor's own acts; and (4) the right of way is at the point least prejudicial to the servient estate. The Central failed to allege or prove these requisites, particularly isolation, as the mill site was accessible by provincial roads.

The Court also rejected the Central's arguments based on special laws:
1.  **Act 2479 (Sugar Central Act):** The provision authorizing the Central to obtain "rights of way" did not convey ownership (fee simple) of the land but merely an easement, which is an encumbrance that respects the ownership of the Landowners.
2.  **Act 4166 (Sugar Limitation Law):** This law regulates sugar production quotas and does not renew expired milling contracts or rights of way.
3.  **Good Faith (Art. 448):** The Central was not a builder in good faith entitled to retention rights because it knew from the beginning that its possession was based on a contract with a fixed term.

Since the Central had no existing right after the contract expired and failed to establish the preconditions for a compulsory easement, the injunction was baseless.

**Petition granted.** The orders of the respondent court are annulled and set aside, and the preliminary injunction issued by the Supreme Court against the lower court is made permanent.
