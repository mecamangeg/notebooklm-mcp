I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LORENZO MANA-AY and WILFREDO PEREZ, G.R. No. L-26192, July 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On the evening of October 3, 1964, in Pototan, Iloilo, Rudy Postrado went to a movie with two 13-year-old friends, Alfredo Ga-a and Francisco Pastera. Inside the theater, appellants Lorenzo Mana-ay and Wilfredo Perez, along with an unidentified companion, sat behind Postrado and demanded money, which he gave [1]. After the show, Perez forcibly dragged Postrado to the back of the Roman Catholic Church. Mana-ay and the third man followed. While Perez and the companion held Postrado's arms, Mana-ay stabbed him in the back with a kitchen knife. Perez then stabbed him with an ice pick, and the third man used a butcher's knife [1]. Postrado died from the wounds [2].

The witnesses immediately reported the incident to the police but could not name the assailants. Months later, they accidentally saw Mana-ay in the municipal jail (detained for another crime) and Perez visiting him, leading to their identification and the filing of murder charges [2]. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo convicted the appellants of murder and sentenced them to *reclusion perpetua*. Appellants appealed, questioning the credibility of witness Ga-a, arguing he was coached because he admitted his parents reminded him of the contents of his affidavit before trial [3, 4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the testimony of the 13-year-old prosecution witness is credible despite his admission that his parents reminded him of his affidavit's contents.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, ruling that the witness's testimony was worthy of full faith and credit. The trial court found the 13-year-old witness to be intelligent, sincere, and steadfast in his narration despite a long and severe cross-examination [4, 5].

The Court held that the witness's admission regarding his parents reminding him of his affidavit is of little importance and insufficient to destroy his credibility. It was reasonably construed that the parents, knowing his tender age, merely had occasion to remind him of the facts, which is "quite different from any direct or indirect attempt to induce him to tell falsehoods" [4]. The factual findings of the lower court regarding the witness's credibility were upheld as they were supported by the evidence [6].

Decision affirmed.
