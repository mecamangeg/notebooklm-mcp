I. CAPTION
NORBERTO DE LA REA v. HON. ABELARDO SUBIDO and HON. JOSE D. CALDERON, G.R. No. L-26082, July 31, 1968.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Norberto de la Rea received promotional appointments from the Auditor General, first as Auditor and later as Corporate Auditor of the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO). However, the Civil Service Commissioner, respondent Abelardo Subido, disapproved these appointments [1, 2]. The Supreme Court previously held that upon the finality of this disapproval, De la Rea was deemed reverted to his original position as Auditor of Pasay City [2]. While his salary as Pasay City Auditor was P11,400 per annum, the Court recognized his entitlement to P15,600 per annum during the period he acted as NAMARCO Auditor [2]. A Motion for Clarification was filed regarding the specific amounts De la Rea needed to reimburse given these salary differences [1, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N De la Rea must reimburse the salaries he received while serving as Auditor of NAMARCO and after the disapproval of his appointment.

IV. RULING
**YES, but with qualifications.** The Court resolved the Motion for Clarification by establishing a specific basis for reimbursement:

1.  **During Actual Service:** De la Rea acts as Auditor/Corporate Auditor of NAMARCO. No reimbursement is required for this period unless he collected salaries exceeding the authorized rate of P15,600 per annum, or if he continued to collect this salary after the disapproval of his appointment had already become final [4].
2.  **After Finality of Disapproval:** Upon the finality of the disapproval, De la Rea reverted to his position as Auditor of Pasay City. Consequently, he must reimburse NAMARCO for any amount collected in excess of his legal salary as Auditor of Pasay City, which is P11,400 per annum [2, 4].

The Court disposed of the motion by ordering reimbursement only for the excess amounts collected after the reversion to his original item or any amount exceeding the authorized NAMARCO rate during his temporary tenure [4].
