I. CAPTION
MAYO LOPEZ CARILLO, HONEY LOPEZ PANGANIBAN, BENITA LOPEZ, ALBINA H. LOPEZ and BALBINO BIADO v. ALLIED WORKERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES (AWA), RAFAEL DIDAL, BALTAZAR DE ASIS, DIEGO CABALLES, CRISPIN BUENAFE and the HON. ARTEMIO C. MACALINO, G.R. No. L-23689, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 567, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Respondents Rafael Didal, et al., were originally farm workers and later appointed as security guards at Hacienda Fara-on. In April 1963, they affiliated with the respondent Union (AWA). On May 21, 1963, petitioner Mayo Lopez Carillo, the hacienda administrator, summoned the respondents and informed them that as security guards, they could not be union members. Carillo gave them an ultimatum: relinquish their union membership or be transferred to ordinary field work (weeding, cane cutting) with lower wages. Unwilling to quit the union, the respondents did not report for work, claiming constructive discharge. They filed a case with the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR).

The CAR ruled in favor of the respondents, finding the petitioners guilty of unfair labor practice (ULP) and ordering the reinstatement of the security guards with back wages. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the transfer was not ULP and challenging the CAR's jurisdiction because the acts occurred before the effectivity of the Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844) and arguing that security guards do not fall under agrarian relations.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioners committed an unfair labor practice by transferring the respondents due to union affiliation.
2. W/N the Court of Agrarian Relations had jurisdiction over the case despite the acts occurring prior to the Agricultural Land Reform Code and the respondents being security guards.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The proposed transfer of the respondents to other phases of farm work with lower wages tended to discourage membership in the union of their choosing and constituted an unfair labor practice. The requirement that they relinquish union membership to keep their positions as security guards was discriminatory. This was a finding of fact by the CAR resting on substantial evidence, which the Supreme Court will not disturb on appeal unless shown to be unfounded or arbitrarily arrived at (*Lapina v. Court of Agrarian Relations*).

2. **YES.** First, even before the Agricultural Land Reform Code took effect in 1963, the unfair labor practice provisions of the Industrial Peace Act (R.A. 875) were already applicable to agricultural laborers (*Santos v. Court of Industrial Relations*). Second, regarding the argument that security guards do not fall under "agrarian relations" (based on *Dequito v. Lopez*), the petitioners are barred from raising this jurisdictional defect due to laches. They actively participated in the proceedings below and only raised the issue of jurisdiction after an adverse decision was rendered against them. To allow them to challenge jurisdiction at this late stage would be inequitable and unfair (*Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*). Furthermore, procedural rigidity must yield to the principle of social justice, which mandates the protection of the economically underprivileged (*Article II, Section 5, Constitution*).

The decision of the respondent Judge is **AFFIRMED**.
