I. CAPTION
HENG TONG TEXTILES CO., INC. (now PHILIP MANUFACTURING CORPORATION) v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE and THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, G.R. No. L-19737, August 26, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
In 1952, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed petitioner Heng Tong Textiles Co., Inc. for deficiency sales taxes and surcharges amounting to P89,123.58 for importations of textiles made in 1949 and the first four months of 1950 [1]. The goods were withdrawn from Customs by Pan-Asiatic Commercial Co., Inc., a sister corporation, which paid the advance sales tax in the petitioner's name [2, 3]. The petitioner argued it was not the real importer but merely allowed its name to be used for accommodation to build its reputation with foreign suppliers, while Pan-Asiatic financed the transactions [4]. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the assessment, ruling that the commercial documents were in the petitioner's name and the arrangement was merely a method to minimize taxes [3, 5]. The CTA also imposed a 50% surcharge for fraud [2].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petitioner is the real importer liable for the deficiency sales taxes.
2. W/N the petitioner is liable for the 50% surcharge for fraud.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The petitioner was the real importer and must shoulder the tax burden. The Court held that the commercial documents (shipping papers, insurance, and tax payments) were all in the petitioner's name [3]. The claim that this was merely an accommodation or private arrangement between sister corporations does not affect the petitioner's role as the importer regarding the government's right to collect taxes [4, 6].

2. **NO.** The arrangement resorted to does not by itself justify the imposition of the 50% fraud penalty. Under Section 183(a), paragraph 3 of the Internal Revenue Code, fraud implies "willful neglect" or the "willful making of a false or fraudulent return" [7, 8]. The Court reiterated the doctrine in *Yutivo Sons Hardware Co. v. CTA* that the intention to minimize taxes must be proved to exist by clear and convincing evidence, not merely by a preponderance of evidence or speculation [7, 9]. The record showed no such evidence, and the petitioner's actions were not incompatible with a good faith belief that endorsing the goods to Pan-Asiatic shifted the importer status [8].

The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is **MODIFIED** to eliminate the 50% penalty, and **AFFIRMED** in all other respects [10].
