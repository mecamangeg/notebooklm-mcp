I. CAPTION
FARM IMPLEMENT & MACHINERY CO. v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-22212, August 30, 1968, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
On December 27, 1953, petitioner imported 118 bags of zinc oxide dry pigment from the United States, manufactured by New Jersey Zinc Sales Co. Petitioner entered the goods as duty-free "United States articles" under Section 311 of the Bell Trade Act, relying on certificates of origin from the supplier. Upon examination, customs officers found red labels on the packages stating "U.S. Customs... Under Bond... must be Delivered Intact to the Chief Officer of the Customs at New York."

Based on these labels, the Collector of Customs concluded the goods were manufactured from imported raw materials under bond (to avoid U.S. duties upon exportation) and thus did not qualify for exemption. The Collector imposed customs duties and advance sales tax totaling P391.50, which petitioner paid under protest. Additionally, the Collector ordered the forfeiture of the shipment for fraudulent misdeclaration under Section 1363(m) of the Revised Administrative Code. The Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision, and the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) sustained it. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the importation of zinc oxide is exempt from customs duties as a "United States article" under the Bell Trade Act.
2. W/N the importation is subject to forfeiture for fraudulent misdeclaration.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 2 of the Bell Trade Act, a "United States article" must be (1) wholly of the growth, product, or manufacture of the U.S., or (2) produced with imported materials the value of which does not exceed 20% of the article's value [1, 2]. The presence of red labels indicated the goods were produced in a bonded smelting warehouse under Section 312 of the U.S. Tariff Act of 1930, implying the use of imported materials to avoid U.S. duties [3, 4]. Petitioner failed to prove that the value of these imported materials did not exceed the 20% limit [5]. As tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer, the claim for refund is denied [6].

2. **NO.** Fraud is never presumed and must be proved to justify forfeiture [7]. Under Section 1363(m-3) and (m-4) of the Revised Administrative Code, forfeiture requires the "wrongful" making of false declarations [8]. Petitioner merely faithfully restated data from the supplier's documents and had no prior knowledge of the red labels or the non-exempt status of the goods [8, 9]. There was no evidence of fraud or intent to evade duties to justify forfeiture under Section 1363(m-5) [10]. Petitioner acted in good faith by relying on the supplier's certificates, even if mistaken as a matter of law [11].

The judgment is MODIFIED. The forfeiture is reversed and the bond cancelled, but the denial of the refund for duties paid is affirmed.
