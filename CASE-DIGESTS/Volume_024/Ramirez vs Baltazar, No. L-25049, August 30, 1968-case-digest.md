I. CAPTION
FILEMON RAMIREZ, MONICA RAMIREZ, and JOSE EGUARAS v. ARTEMIO BALTAZAR, ET AL., G.R. No. L-25049, August 30, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Victoriana Eguaras mortgaged a parcel of land to spouses Artemio Baltazar and Susana Flores. Upon her death, the mortgagees filed a petition for intestate proceedings (Civil Case No. SC-99), specifically alleging that Filemon and Monica Ramirez were the heirs of the deceased. Artemio Diawan, a deputy clerk of court, was appointed administrator of the estate. Subsequently, the mortgagees filed a foreclosure suit against Administrator Diawan. Diawan failed to answer and was declared in default; he also acted as the hearing commissioner receiving evidence against the estate. The court rendered a decision foreclosing the property, which was sold to the mortgagees at public auction.

Filemon, Monica, and Jose Eguaras (heirs) filed a complaint (Civil Case No. SC-319) to annul the foreclosure proceedings, alleging collusion between Diawan and the mortgagees for failing to notify the heirs and allowing the judgment to lapse. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the plaintiffs lacked legal capacity to sue because their status as heirs had not yet been judicially determined in the intestate proceedings. The trial court dismissed the complaint, ruling that the heirs had no standing and finding no collusion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the defendants are estopped from questioning the heirship of the plaintiffs.
2. W/N the heirs have legal capacity to sue for the annulment of foreclosure proceedings despite the existence of an administrator.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the defendants are estopped from questioning the heirship of Filemon and Monica Ramirez. In their own petition for intestate proceedings (Case SC-99), the defendants explicitly alleged that these plaintiffs were the heirs of the deceased. Having made such an admission in a judicial proceeding, they cannot subsequently question the very fact they previously asserted.

2. **YES.** Under Article 777 of the New Civil Code, rights to succession are automatically transmitted to the heirs from the moment of the decedent's death. While the general rule is that heirs have no legal standing in court upon the commencement of testate or intestate proceedings—as the administrator represents the estate—this rule admits of exceptions. Citing *Pascual v. Pascual*, the Court ruled that heirs may act in place of the administrator when the latter fails or refuses to act. In this case, the administrator was charged with collusion and connivance with the mortgagees to the prejudice of the estate. It would be farfetched to expect the administrator to file an action against himself or the mortgagees based on his own fraud. Therefore, the heirs, having an interest to protect, are entitled to bring the action.

The Order of the lower court dismissing the complaint is **SET ASIDE**, and the records are remanded for further proceedings.
