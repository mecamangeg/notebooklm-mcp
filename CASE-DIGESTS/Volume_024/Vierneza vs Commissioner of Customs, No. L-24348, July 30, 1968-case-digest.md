I. CAPTION
FELICIDAD VIERNEZA v. THE COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, G.R. No. L-24348, July 30, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On September 16, 1957, the M/V "Legaspi" arrived at the port of Cebu from Jolo. Acting on a tip regarding smuggled goods, Customs authorities searched the vessel and discovered 760 cartons of Chesterfield and Camel cigarettes with blue seals but lacking the required Internal Revenue strip stamps. The goods were declared in the bill of lading as "personal belongings." Petitioner Vierneza, a passenger, held the bill of lading but disclaimed ownership under oath during the search. The Collector of Customs of Cebu seized the cigarettes and instituted forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code (TCC).

The Collector ordered the forfeiture of the goods. On appeal, the Commissioner of Customs affirmed the decision but modified the grounds to include violation of Section 2530(m-1) of the TCC. The Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirmed the Commissioner’s decision. Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Collector of Customs of Cebu lacked jurisdiction as the alleged smuggling occurred in Jolo, that she bought the goods in the open market without knowledge of their illegal importation, and that the Commissioner could not forfeit the goods under a section not originally cited.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Collector of Customs of Cebu had jurisdiction to seize and forfeit the goods found in his district.
2. W/N the cigarettes were subject to forfeiture despite Petitioner’s claim of purchase in the open market.
3. W/N the Commissioner of Customs could forfeit the goods under a provision (Sec. 2530 m-1) not originally cited by the Collector.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Tariff and Customs Code empowers the Bureau of Customs to prevent and suppress smuggling over all seas and ports within the Philippines. Under Section 2203, a Collector is authorized to search and seize any article subject to forfeiture "at any place within the jurisdiction of the said Bureau" [1]. It is the right of a customs officer to seize goods suspected of violation of revenue laws not only in his own district but also in any other district [1]. Furthermore, forfeiture proceedings are *in rem*, and jurisdiction is vested in the court of the district where the *res* (the goods) is found or seized [2].

2. **YES.** The absence of Philippine internal revenue strip stamps and the presence of blue seals satisfactorily proved the cigarettes were foreign products imported contrary to law [3]. The fact that Petitioner bought them in the open market did not render them immune. Under Section 2531 of the TCC, forfeiture occurs while the merchandise is in the hands or control of a person who buys, conceals, or transports the same with knowledge that it was imported contrary to law [4]. Petitioner’s knowledge was proven by the concealment of the goods and her denial of ownership [5].

3. **YES.** The appellate power of the Commissioner of Customs is not limited to issues raised on appeal; he may affirm, modify, or reverse the Collector's decision on other questions supported by evidence [6]. It is of no consequence what the original grounds were if the goods are, in fact, subject to forfeiture by law. What counts is the description of the violation in the seizure report, not merely the designation of the particular section of law [6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
