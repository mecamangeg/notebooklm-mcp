I. CAPTION
DIGNA BALDEVARONA VDA. DE GOMEZ v. AMBROSIO FORTALEZA, G.R. No. L-20872, August 10, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiff Vda. de Gomez filed an action for recovery of money against defendant Fortaleza in the Municipal Court of Bacolod City, which rendered judgment in her favor for P3,200.00. Defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Negros Occidental. Plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was perfected out of time, but the CFI denied the motion, finding the defendant's failure to claim the registered mail containing the decision excusable. The CFI set the case for trial on October 12, 1962. On October 10, plaintiff filed a Motion for Reconsideration (MR) regarding the denial of the motion to dismiss the appeal and set the MR for hearing on the same day as the trial (October 12). On said date, the CFI denied the MR and immediately called the case for trial. As plaintiff was not ready to present evidence while defendant was, the CFI dismissed the complaint for failure to prosecute.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the dismissal of the complaint for failure to prosecute was proper.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that the trial court should not have dismissed the complaint. While the plaintiff was not prepared for trial on the scheduled date and had not filed a motion for postponement, she had a pending Motion for Reconsideration regarding the defendant's appeal and had manifested an intention to elevate that interlocutory matter to a higher court. The Court observed that the plaintiff appeared to have a meritorious claim, evidenced by the favorable judgment she secured in the Municipal Court. Since a dismissal for failure to prosecute has the effect of an adjudication on the merits under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, it would effectively bar her claim. The Court ruled that where a plaintiff has a meritorious claim, she should be accorded a fair chance to vindicate her asserted right, even at the risk of some delay.

The order of dismissal is set aside and the case is remanded for trial and judgment on the merits.
