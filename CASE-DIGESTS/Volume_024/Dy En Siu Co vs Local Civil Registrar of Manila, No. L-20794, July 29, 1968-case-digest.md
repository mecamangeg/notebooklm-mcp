I. CAPTION
DY EN SIU CO, ISIDRO CO, ROBERTO CO, ALFREDO CO and TEODORA CO, represented by their Judicial Guardian MARCIANA BEN v. LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OF THE CITY OF MANILA and REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-20794, July 29, 1968, Fernando, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners, minors represented by their guardian Marciana Ben, filed a petition under Article 412 of the Civil Code with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila to correct entries in the Local Civil Registry. They sought to change their mother's civil status from "married" to "single" and her citizenship from "Chinese" to "Filipino," as well as their own status from "legitimate" to "illegitimate" and their citizenship from "Chinese" to "Filipino" [1-3]. They claimed to be illegitimate children of a Chinese father, Co Te Sing, and Marciana Ben, who were not married [3].

The Local Civil Registrar and the Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing the corrections were substantial. Co Te Sing and his alleged legitimate family also intervened to oppose [4]. The CFI of Manila (Judge Vasquez) treated the oppositions as a motion to dismiss and dismissed the petition, ruling that the changes sought were substantial in nature affecting legitimacy and nationality, which are not permitted under Article 412 [5]. Two petitioners later moved to withdraw the appeal claiming the issue was moot due to a favorable decision in another court branch, but the Supreme Court denied this motion [6, 7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N substantial corrections regarding civil status and citizenship can be effected through a summary proceeding under Article 412 of the Civil Code.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the order of dismissal. The Court held that while the action ostensibly sought a mere correction of entries, it effectively requested a judicial declaration of Philippine citizenship and a change in civil status [8, 9]. Under the doctrine laid down in *Ty Kong Tin v. Republic*, proceedings under Article 412 of the Civil Code are summary in nature and contemplate only the correction of clerical or typographical errors [5, 10]. They do not apply to substantial changes affecting the civil status or citizenship of persons [5, 11]. The Court emphasized that declaratory relief is not available for obtaining a judicial declaration of citizenship [8].

Consequently, the order of the lower court dismissing the complaint is **AFFIRMED** [12].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Castro, J., concurred in the result [12].
