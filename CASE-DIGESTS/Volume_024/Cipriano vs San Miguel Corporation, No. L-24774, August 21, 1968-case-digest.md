I. CAPTION
RAUL CIPRIANO v. SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-24774, August 21, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Raul Cipriano was employed by San Miguel Corporation from September 1953 until April 1964. On April 21, 1964, the company retired him effective April 17, 1964, because the medical department certified he could no longer perform his functions [1, 2]. As a member of the San Miguel Brewery Sales Force Union, Cipriano was covered by a "Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan" [2]. Pursuant to this plan, he received P2,292.28 in retirement benefits, calculated at one month's basic compensation for each year of service [2]. Cipriano subsequently demanded the payment of separation pay under the Termination Pay Law (Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No. 1787) in addition to the retirement benefits he already received [3]. The company refused. Cipriano filed a complaint for recovery of sum of money. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the complaint, ruling that the retirement benefits under the plan were in lieu of the termination pay provided by law [3]. Cipriano appealed directly to the Supreme Court on a question of law [1].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Cipriano is entitled to recover separation pay under the Termination Pay Law in addition to the retirement benefits received under the company's private plan.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. The Court held that Cipriano's right to benefits under the private plan was subject to the limitations prescribed in the collective bargaining agreement [4]. Article X of the agreement specifically provided that regular employees separated for reasons other than misconduct or voluntary resignation shall be entitled to "**either** 100% of the benefits provided... **or** to the severance pay provided by law, **whichever is the greater amount**" [4].

The Court reasoned that the use of the terms "either" and "or," combined with the phrase "whichever is the greater amount," clearly deduces the exclusion of one benefit by the other [5]. An employee has a right to one of the two benefits, but not to both simultaneously [5]. Since the benefit under the plan (one month compensation for each year of service) was greater than the Termination Pay Law benefit (limited to one-half month compensation for every year of service), Cipriano was entitled only to the plan benefits [6, 7].

The decision appealed from is hereby **AFFIRMED** [7].
