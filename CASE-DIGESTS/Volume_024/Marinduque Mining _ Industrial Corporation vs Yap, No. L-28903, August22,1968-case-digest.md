I. CAPTION
MARINDUQUE MINING & INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION v. YAP, ET AL., G.R. No. L-28903, August 22, 1968, 24 SCRA 705, Sanchez, J.

II. FACTS
Marinduque Mining filed a petition for interpleader in the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental against PAFLU, NAMAWU-PAFLU, and various officers, including Santiago Yap, to determine the proper recipient of checked-off union dues under a 1964 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) [1, 2]. The trial court declared Yap, et al. in default on January 17, 1966, prompting them to appeal the order to the Supreme Court [2].

While the appeal was pending, a certification election was conducted on June 9, 1967, wherein a new union, Lakas ng Manggagawang Makabayan (ALU)—represented by appellants Yap and Prudencio Jalandoni—won against the incumbent union [3]. Consequently, Marinduque Mining and ALU executed a new CBA on November 13, 1967 [3]. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal as moot, but appellants opposed, arguing the Court should still resolve the issue of whether the lower court had jurisdiction over internal union matters [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the appeal should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that the case had become moot and academic due to the results of the certification election and the execution of the new CBA [3, 5]. The Court held that since the case was moot, it would serve "no useful purpose to pass upon the questions raised in the appeal," specifically the jurisdictional question raised by the appellants [5].

Accordingly, the present case was dismissed [5].
