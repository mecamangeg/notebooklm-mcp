I. CAPTION
ERNESTO VELUZ v. SOCORRO VELUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-23261, July 31, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

II. FACTS
On January 2, 1953, plaintiff Ernesto Veluz signed a document purporting to be a deed of absolute sale of his land in favor of the defendants for P5,000.00. However, Veluz claimed the true agreement was a mortgage and that he was assured he could redeem the property at any time. In May 1958, the defendants refused to allow him to redeem the property. On July 30, 1958, Veluz filed a complaint praying for the reformation of the instrument to express the true intention of the parties as a mortgage.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of prescription. The Court of First Instance of Quezon dismissed the complaint, ruling that the action was essentially for the annulment of a contract based on fraud. Applying Article 1391 of the Civil Code, the lower court held that the action had prescribed because more than four years had elapsed since the discovery of the fraud upon the execution of the deed in 1953. Veluz appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the action for reformation of the instrument has prescribed.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court set aside the dismissal and remanded the case. The Court held that the lower court erred in characterizing the action as one for annulment of contract. The complaint's allegations and prayer clearly sought **reformation of instrument** under Articles 1359 and 1365 of the Civil Code.

The Court distinguished the two remedies: **Reformation** presupposes a valid, existing contract where there was a meeting of the minds, but the instrument fails to reflect the true agreement; **Annulment** presupposes a defective contract where the minds did not meet or consent was vitiated.

Regarding prescription, the Court ruled that the action for reformation constitutes an action upon a written contract. While the chapter on Reformation of Instruments is silent on prescription, the Court applied the ruling in *Conde v. Cuenca* (1956) over the earlier *Carlota v. Benares* (1955) decision. Under **Article 1144 of the Civil Code**, an action upon a written contract must be brought within **ten (10) years**. Since the document was executed in 1953 and the complaint was filed in 1958, the action was well within the prescriptive period.
