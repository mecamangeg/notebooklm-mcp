I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. APOLONIO APDUHAN, JR., G.R. No. L-19491, August 30, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On May 23, 1961, in Mabini, Bohol, Apolonio Apduhan, Jr. and his co-accused, armed with unlicensed firearms, entered the dwelling of the Miano spouses, killed Geronimo Miano and Norberto Aton, and took P322.00 [1], [2]. Apduhan was charged with Robbery with Homicide [1]. Initially pleading not guilty, he later changed his plea to guilty but requested life imprisonment instead of death [3]. After the trial judge warned him that the death penalty might still be imposed, Apduhan equivocated but eventually entered a categorical plea of guilty [3], [4]. The Court of First Instance convicted him of Robbery with Homicide and sentenced him to death, ruling that the crime was committed with the special aggravating circumstance of use of unlicensed firearm under Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code, as well as the aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nighttime, and abuse of superior strength [5], [6]. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court on automatic review [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the use of an unlicensed firearm should be appreciated as a special aggravating circumstance under Article 296 in a conviction for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294(1).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court held that Article 296 is exclusively linked and corollary to Article 295, which applies only to robbery cases described in subdivisions 3, 4, and 5 of Article 294 [8]. Since Robbery with Homicide falls under Article 294(1), it is excluded from the coverage of Article 295; consequently, the special aggravating circumstance of use of unlicensed firearm under Article 296 cannot be applied to it [9], [10]. The use of an unlicensed firearm in Robbery with Homicide is not a special aggravating circumstance, although "band" (*cuadrilla*) may be appreciated as a generic aggravating circumstance [11], [12].

Despite the exclusion of the special aggravating circumstance, the Court found that the generic aggravating circumstances of dwelling and nighttime (which was purposely sought) were present and not offset by the sole mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty [13], [14]. Intoxication was not appreciated as it was not proven to be non-habitual or unintentional [15]. However, due to the lack of necessary votes for the imposition of the death penalty, the judgment was modified, and Apduhan was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* [16].
