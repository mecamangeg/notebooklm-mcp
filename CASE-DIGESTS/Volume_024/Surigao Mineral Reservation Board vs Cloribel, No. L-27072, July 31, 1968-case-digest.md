I. CAPTION
SURIGAO MINERAL RESERVATION BOARD and the EXECUTIVE SECRETARY vs. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and MAC-ARTHUR INTERNATIONAL MINERALS CO., G.R. No. L-27072, July 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On December 2, 1964, the Surigao Mineral Reservation Board (the Board) issued an Invitation to Bid for the exploration and development of mineral deposits in Surigao. Mac-Arthur International Minerals Co. (the Company) submitted a bid, which the Board subsequently rejected. The Company’s request for reconsideration was denied.

On September 1, 1966, the Company filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Board, presided over by Judge Gaudencio Cloribel. The Company argued that the Invitation to Bid was an "offer" and their bid was an "acceptance," resulting in a perfected contract. Judge Cloribel issued a restraining order on November 16, 1966, enjoining the Board from ignoring the alleged contract, and subsequently refused to lift it. The Board filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court, arguing the Company had no cause of action.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the submission of a bid in response to an Invitation to Bid creates a perfected contract that binds the government.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that an Invitation to Bid is not an "offer" which matures into a contract upon acceptance. Under Article 1326 of the Civil Code, "advertisements for bidders are simply invitations to make proposals and the advertiser is not bound to accept the highest or lowest bidder, unless the contrary appears" [1].

Furthermore, the Invitation to Bid expressly reserved the right to reject "any and all bids." By participating in the bidding, the Company accepted this term and is estopped from objecting to the Board's exercise of that right [2]. Acceptance by the Board is necessary for a contract to exist. Additionally, the Company failed to post the required bid bond, violating the terms of the invitation [3]. Consequently, the Company had no cause of action, and Judge Cloribel committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the restraining order.

The orders of the respondent Judge are ANNULLED and the writ of preliminary injunction is GRANTED [4].
