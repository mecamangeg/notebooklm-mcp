I. CAPTION
JOSE T. JAMANDRE v. HON. COURT OF APPEALS and MARIA JAMANDRE-YANSON, G.R. No. L-24606, August 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Maria Jamandre-Yanson filed a complaint against her brother, petitioner Jose T. Jamandre, to annul a deed of sale (Exhibit Y) over her house and lot and to recover a store. Maria alleged that Jose, a lawyer, deceived her into signing blank papers under the pretense of selling her truck, which he later converted into a deed of sale for her real property. Jose claimed the sale was valid and supported by consideration.

The Trial Court ruled in favor of Maria, declaring the deed void for being simulated. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) initially reversed the decision and declared Jose the owner. However, upon Maria's motion for reconsideration—which included a retraction affidavit from their mother (an intervenor)—the CA set aside its original decision and entered a new resolution affirming the Trial Court's judgment, declaring the deed fictitious and without consideration. Jose petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing the CA erred in relying on the retraction affidavits and in its appreciation of the evidence regarding the deed's validity.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court can review the Court of Appeals' finding that the deed of sale is fictitious and without consideration.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the resolution, ruling that the Court of Appeals' determination that the deed of sale (Exhibit Y) is "fictitious and without consideration" is a finding of fact, which is final and conclusive upon the Supreme Court [1]. Under Section 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1948 and Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, the appellate court's findings of fact are not subject to review, as the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is limited to questions of law [2].

Furthermore, the Court found the CA's conclusion supported by the evidence, noting several badges of fraud: (1) the lack of actual consideration, as the alleged payment was meant to settle a mortgage debt, leaving Maria with nothing [3]; (2) the petitioner’s insolvency compared to the respondent’s financial stability [4, 5]; (3) the petitioner’s failure to immediately register the sale [6]; and (4) corroborating testimonies regarding the deception involving the blank papers [7]. The Court also clarified that the CA did not use the retraction affidavits as primary evidence, but merely as a justification to re-examine the record with "painstaking care" [8].

Resolution affirmed.
