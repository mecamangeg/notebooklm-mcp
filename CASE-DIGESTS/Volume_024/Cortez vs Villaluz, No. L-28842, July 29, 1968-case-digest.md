I. CAPTION
FAUSTINO CORTEZ v. HONORABLE ONOFRE VILLALUZ, Presiding Judge, Court of Agrarian Relations, Fifth Regional District, Branch Two, San Fernando, Pampanga, ATTY. SANTIAGO SUÑGA, Clerk of Court, and JOSE REYES, G.R. No. L-28842, July 29, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Jose Reyes filed an action in the Court of Agrarian Relations (Case No. 625) against Liborio Cortez, the petitioner's father, for ejectment and collection of rentals. Liborio filed an answer but failed to appear at the pre-trial, leading the court to receive evidence ex-parte and render judgment against him on February 19, 1968. On March 2, 1968, the trial court issued an order directing the Clerk of Court to supervise the reaping and liquidation of the crop. Petitioner Faustino Cortez subsequently filed a motion to set aside this order, claiming that he, and not his father, was the real tenant of the landholding and that he had not been made a party to the case. The trial court denied the motion, ruling Faustino had no standing. Faustino then filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court. Records revealed that in a prior case (Case No. 248) filed in 1965, Liborio had already admitted to being the tenant of the same landholding.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Petitioner Faustino Cortez has the standing to set aside the trial court's order and judgment on the ground that he is the real tenant.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and denied the writs prayed for. The Court held that the factual question of who was the real tenant—the father or the son—had already been resolved by the lower court in both the earlier Case No. 248 (affirmed by the Court of Appeals) and the subject Case No. 625. The Court ruled that Faustino Cortez's late appearance and filing of the petition were "obviously intended to frustrate the judgment rendered against his father," which had already become final and executory. Furthermore, the respondents averred that the order complained of had already been fully implemented and carried out.
