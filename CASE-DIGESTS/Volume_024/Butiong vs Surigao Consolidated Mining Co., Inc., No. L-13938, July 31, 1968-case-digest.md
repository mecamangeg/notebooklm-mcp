I. CAPTION
IN THE MATTER OF THE PROBATE OF THE WILL OF CHRISTIAN HARRIS; PEDRO BUTIONG v. SURIGAO CONSOLIDATED MINING CO., INC., G.R. No. L-13938, July 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Christian Harris died on December 7, 1941. On September 7, 1954, Pedro Butiong filed a petition in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Surigao for the probate of Harris' will, which appointed Butiong as the sole and universal heir. Butiong explained the delay in filing was due to the Japanese occupation during the war and the subsequent accidental misplacement of the will. Surigao Consolidated Mining Co., Inc. opposed the probate, alleging the will was a forgery and questioning the publication of notice. The CFI admitted the will to probate. Surigao Consolidated appealed, but Butiong argued that the mining company lacked the legal interest to oppose the petition [1-6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Surigao Consolidated Mining Co., Inc. has the legal capacity/interest to oppose the probate of the will.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court ruled that Surigao Consolidated Mining Co., Inc. lacked the standing to intervene. It is well-settled that one who has or can have no interest in succeeding a decedent cannot oppose the probate of his alleged will. The appellant mining company did not claim to have any interest in the succession of Christian Harris. Therefore, the lower court should not have entertained its opposition. The Court cited *In the Matter of the Will of Kabigting* (14 Phil. 463), *Paras v. Narciso* (35 Phil. 244), and others to support this doctrine. Furthermore, the Court found the appellant's claims regarding forgery meritless, as the positive testimony of attesting witnesses outweighed the negative testimony of the appellant's handwriting expert [5, 7].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED [8].
