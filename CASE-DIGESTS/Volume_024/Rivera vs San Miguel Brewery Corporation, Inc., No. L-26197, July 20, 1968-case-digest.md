I. CAPTION
ADELO C. RIVERA v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY CORPORATION, INC., G.R. No. L-26197, July 20, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Adelo C. Rivera was employed as a security guard by San Miguel Brewery Corporation (SMB) from 1952 until his separation due to physical disability in 1963. Under SMB's private Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan, Rivera was entitled to P1,261.75 in retirement benefits. However, SMB paid him only P930.35, deducting P331.40 which represented the total amount SMB had contributed to the Social Security System (SSS) on Rivera's behalf [1-3]. Rivera, who was not a member of the labor union that negotiated the private plan, filed a suit for the recovery of the deducted amount [4, 5]. The City Court of Cagayan de Oro and the Court of First Instance of Misamis Oriental dismissed the complaint, ruling that SMB had validly paid its obligation [5, 6].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the employer may deduct the amount of its SSS contributions from the retirement benefits due to an employee under a private company plan.
2. W/N the provisions of a private benefit plan derived from a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) are binding on a non-union employee.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court held that the deduction is authorized under Section 9 of the Social Security Act, which mandates the integration of private plans with the SSS [7]. The law provides that if an employer's contribution to a private plan exceeds the required SSS contribution, the employer shall pay the SSS and continue contributing to the private plan *less* the SSS contribution, ensuring the employer's *total* contribution remains the same [3, 7]. Furthermore, Article XV of SMB's private plan explicitly authorized reducing benefits by the amount of the employer's SSS contribution [8]. To allow the employee to receive full private benefits plus SSS benefits without deduction would constitute unjust enrichment [9]. The Court also clarified that Section 19 of the Social Security Act, which prohibits recovering contributions from an employee's *compensation*, does not apply here because retirement pay is a *fringe benefit* and the deduction was made from the private plan payout, not the employee's wages [10, 11].

2. **YES.** Although Rivera was not a union member, the private plan was established pursuant to a CBA. Jurisprudence dictates that benefits of a CBA extend to non-union members to prevent undue discrimination [12]. Consequently, if a non-member claims the benefits of the plan, they must also accept the accompanying burdens and conditions, such as the deduction clause in Article XV [13].

**Judgment affirmed.**
