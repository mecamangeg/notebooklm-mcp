I. CAPTION
NATIONAL MARKETING CORPORATION (NAMARCO) and JOVENAL D. ALMENDRAS v. HON. GAUDENCIO CLORIBEL and GERMAN E. VILLANUEVA (VILTRA COMPANY), G.R. No. L-27260, August 8, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent German Villanueva (VILTRA) originally filed a special civil action for mandamus against petitioner NAMARCO [1], [2]. Respondent Judge Cloribel admitted an amended complaint from VILTRA which transformed the action into one for specific performance [1]. Despite NAMARCO filing answers contesting the validity and perfection of the alleged contract on factual and legal grounds, Judge Cloribel rendered a summary partial decision and issued writs for execution [1], [3]. NAMARCO filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, which the Supreme Court granted in a decision dated April 29, 1968, holding that the summary judgment was irregular [1], [4]. Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification, arguing that the Supreme Court erred in ruling on the correctness of the summary judgment, as that judgment was the subject of a separate appeal (G.R. No. L-27441), and asked for clarification that the decision does not foreclose the merits of said appeal [5], [6].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Supreme Court, in ruling against the summary judgment, decided the merits of the contract validity subject of a separate pending appeal.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court clarified that it did not rule on the *merits* of the decision rendered by the respondent judge (i.e., whether the contract was valid or perfected) [4]. Rather, the Court ruled that the respondent court was not in a position to render a summary judgment because the validity of the contract was raised as an issue on both factual and legal grounds [4]. Under Rule 36 of the Rules of Court, a summary judgment is improper when genuine issues exist, and the record showed requirements were not complied with [4]. The Court emphasized that its decision does not decide whether the contract between VILTRA and NAMARCO was perfected or binding; it only held that the summary rendition of judgment was procedurally irregular [7].

Motion for reconsideration denied; decision clarified [8].
