I. CAPTION
ADELO C. RIVERA v. SAN MIGUEL BREWERY CORPORATION, G.R. No. L-26197, August 30, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
Adelo C. Rivera (Rivera), an employee of San Miguel Brewery Corporation (San Miguel), retired and was entitled to retirement benefits amounting to P1,261.75 under the company's private "Health, Welfare and Retirement Plan." San Miguel deducted P331.40 from this amount, representing the total contributions the company had paid to the Social Security System (SSS) on Rivera's behalf. This deduction was made pursuant to Article XV of the private plan, which stipulated that benefits would be reduced by amounts sufficient to compensate the company for its SSS contributions. Rivera protested, arguing that the private plan was a unilateral contract vesting him the full amount, and that the deduction violated Section 19 of the Social Security Act, which prohibits employers from recovering their contributions from employees' compensation. The parties submitted the case on stipulated facts.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the employer (San Miguel) may validly deduct the amount of its SSS contributions from the retirement benefits due to the employee under a private benefit plan.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court held that under **Section 9 of the Social Security Act**, when a private benefit plan is integrated with the Social Security System, the employer has the right to deduct its SSS contributions from the benefits due to the employee under the private plan. The legislative intent is to preclude the employer from shouldering a "double burden" of paying both the full private plan benefits and the mandatory SSS premiums [1], [2].

The Court rejected Rivera's argument regarding **Section 19 of the Social Security Act**. While Section 19 prohibits employers from deducting their SSS contributions from an employee's *compensation*, it must be harmonized with Section 9. The prohibition in Section 19 prevents shifting the burden of the premium to the employee, but it does not bar the employer from adjusting its contributions to a *private benefit plan* as expressly allowed by Section 9 [3], [4]. Furthermore, the Court ruled that the employer is not required to deduct the contributions monthly; the right can be exercised upon the payment of the private benefit to avoid cumbersome accounting procedures [5], [6].

**Motion for Reconsideration denied.**
