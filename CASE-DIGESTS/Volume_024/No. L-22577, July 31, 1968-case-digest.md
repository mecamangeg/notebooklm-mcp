I. CAPTION
BENJAMIN WENCESLAO, ET AL. v. CARMEN ZARAGOZA, INC., G.R. No. L-22577, July 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Plaintiffs Benjamin Wenceslao and other employees worked for defendant Carmen Zaragoza, Inc. in its "Times Film Exchange" department. On February 28, 1962, due to the termination of its contract with Allied Artists Corporation, the defendant closed the Times Film Exchange department and terminated the plaintiffs’ services effective that date without advance notice or separation pay. The plaintiffs were formally notified of the termination only on March 5, 1962.

Immediately after the closure, on March 1, 1962, the plaintiffs were employed by Times Film Corporation, a new entity handling the Allied Artists bookings. Plaintiffs subsequently demanded separation pay under Republic Act No. 1787 (Termination Pay Law). The defendant denied the claim, arguing that the closure of its business department was a just cause for termination and that the plaintiffs had impliedly resigned or abandoned their employment by accepting jobs with the new corporation.

The Municipal Court of Manila ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the decision, ordering the defendant to pay separation pay and attorney's fees. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the closing of a specific division or department constitutes a "closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or enterprise" that serves as just cause for termination without separation pay.
2. W/N the plaintiffs abandoned their employment by accepting jobs with a new employer immediately upon termination.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that under the Termination Pay Law (Republic Act No. 1787), the just cause for terminating an employment without a definite period is the closing or cessation of operation of the **establishment or enterprise** of the employer, and not merely the closing of a particular division or department. The Court refused to read such an interpretation into the law as it would adversely affect the rights of employees. Since only the "Times Film Exchange" department was closed and not Carmen Zaragoza, Inc. as an entire enterprise, the termination was not for the just cause specified by law.

2. **NO.** The Court rejected the defense of abandonment. The record showed the plaintiffs did not apply for the new jobs; rather, the defendant arranged for their transfer. The plaintiffs had no reasonable alternative but to accept the new employment to avoid being on "the street." Furthermore, the new employer did not credit their past years of service with the defendant, meaning they started from scratch. This was prejudicial to the plaintiffs, as it affected their rights to future separation pay and privileges, proving that the transfer did not fully satisfy the law's purpose of providing relief through notice or separation pay.

**Decision affirmed.**
