I. CAPTION
MEMBERS OF THE CULT OF SAN MIGUEL ARCANGEL v. PEDRO NARCISO, G.R. No. L-24843, July 15, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Policarpio Narciso died prior to August 1920, leaving a will executed in 1910. The will allocated a portion of his estate to support the "Cult of San Miguel Arcangel," including a chapel and convent. In Special Proceeding No. 546 (probate), the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan issued orders in 1920 and 1921 implementing the will, directing that the specified properties be administered by the executor as trustee. Consequently, Special Proceeding No. 979 was instituted in 1922 for this trusteeship, with Tranquilino Jimenez appointed as trustee.

Decades later, in 1963, Pedro Narciso (successor trustee) and other heirs filed a motion for the reversion of the trust properties to the heirs. They argued that: (1) an October 31, 1956 court order had "terminated" the trusteeship proceeding; and (2) the trust was void under Article 870 of the New Civil Code, which prohibits trusts lasting longer than 20 years. The lower court denied the petition for reversion.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the trust was terminated by the court order dated October 31, 1956.
2. W/N the trust is void or terminated by the application of Article 870 of the New Civil Code prohibiting perpetual trusts.
3. W/N the petitioners are barred from assailing the validity of the trust.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The order of October 31, 1956, merely stated that the case should be considered terminated for the purpose of the monthly report of pending cases submitted to the Department of Justice. It explicitly provided that this was "without prejudice" to the presentation and resolution of annual accounts or future incidents [1].

2. **NO.** Article 870 of the New Civil Code, which took effect in 1950, cannot apply retroactively to a trust established in 1920. Under Articles 2252 and 2263 of the Civil Code, rights originating under the old legislation (Civil Code of 1889) are governed by the laws in force at that time. New provisions that prejudice or impair vested rights do not have retroactive effect [2].

3. **YES.** The validity of the trust was upheld by necessary implication in the orders issued in Special Proceedings Nos. 546 and 979 over 40 years prior. Even if the provision creating a perpetual trust was originally void under common law or public policy, the court orders enforcing it became final and executory as no appeal was taken. The petitioners are now barred by the principle of laches from challenging the trust's validity after an unreasonable delay [3], [4].

The order appealed from is AFFIRMED and the records remanded to the lower court [5].
