I. CAPTION
THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. BEN PAREDES, MANUEL MAMURI, PROTASIO A. SANTOS, and PASCUAL BARTOLOME, G.R. Nos. L-19149 and L-19150, August 16, 1968, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On April 26, 1960, Chua Nai Su, a wealthy Chinese tobacco dealer, was robbed and killed at the Insular-Yebana Tobacco Corporation warehouse in Naguilian, Isabela. The crime was executed by Ruben Concepcion, Manuel Mamuri, and Aurelio Tottoc, who were recruited by Conrado de Leon.

Prior to the incident, the group stayed at the house of appellant Ben Paredes, a former police sergeant. Paredes introduced them to appellant Pascual Bartolome, who promised a reward of P500.00 to P1,000.00 for killing the victim. Appellant Protasio Santos, the Chief of Police, provided the firearms (two .38 caliber revolvers) and promised immunity from investigation. After the robbery, they split the P400.00 loot.

During the investigation, Tottoc turned state witness and Concepcion pleaded guilty; both implicated Paredes, Santos, and Bartolome. The Court of First Instance of Isabela convicted all accused of Robbery with Homicide. Paredes, Santos, and Bartolome appealed, relying on alibis and attacking the credibility of the accomplices' testimonies.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the testimonies of accomplices (Concepcion and Tottoc) are credible and sufficient to convict the appellants.
2. W/N conspiracy existed among the appellants who did not participate in the actual shooting.
3. W/N the aggravating circumstance of reward or promise should be appreciated.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** While the testimony of an accomplice should be received with extreme caution (*U.S. v. Remigio*), it merits weight and credence when corroborated by other witnesses (*People v. Aranua*). In this case, the details provided by Concepcion and Tottoc regarding the planning, the weapons used, and the meetings were substantially corroborated by independent witnesses (Hilario Tomines, Alberto Ibarra, and Vicente Banang) and physical evidence.

2. **YES.** The evidence conclusively showed a community of design. Paredes housed the perpetrators; Bartolome offered financial inducement; and Santos provided the weapons and promised protection. Where conspiracy is shown, the act of one conspirator is the act of all, and it is of no moment that the appellants did not participate in the actual commission of the crime.

3. **NO.** Under Art. 14, par. 11 of the Revised Penal Code, for reward and promise to be aggravating, the inducement must be the primary consideration in the commission of the felony. The Court found that the accused were already decided on committing the robbery even before the appellants made their promises of reward and immunity.

The decision of the lower court is AFFIRMED.
