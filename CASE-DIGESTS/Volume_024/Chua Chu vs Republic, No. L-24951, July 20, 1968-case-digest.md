**I. CAPTION**
**IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF JOSE CHUA CHU TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. JOSE CHUA CHU v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES**, G.R. No. L-24951, July 20, 1968, Angeles, J.

**II. FACTS**
Jose Chua Chu, a Chinese citizen, filed a petition for naturalization in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Leyte. The CFI granted the petition, finding that he possessed all qualifications and no disqualifications. The Republic appealed the decision, questioning the sufficiency of the character witnesses and the petitioner’s failure to state all former places of residence.

Regarding the witnesses, petitioner presented Pedro Son and Epitacio Sevilla, co-workers at the bakery where petitioner was a sales manager. Son claimed to know petitioner since birth but admitted not seeing him during the war (meeting again only in 1947) and having only occasional business encounters until 1959. Sevilla only became acquainted with the petitioner in 1953, knowing him for only ten years.

Regarding residence, the petition only listed Real St., Ormoc City (present) and 39 Salazar St., Tacloban City (former). However, during testimony, petitioner admitted he was born in Valencia, Ormoc City; evacuated to Lanao during the war (staying until 1945); lived in Ormoc (1945–1947); moved to Wilson St., Tacloban (1947); and then moved to Salazar St. before returning to Ormoc.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the character witnesses presented were sufficient to support the petition.
2. W/N the failure to allege all former places of residence in the petition is fatal to the application.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The witnesses were insufficient. The law requires that an applicant for naturalization establish proper and irreproachable conduct during the *entire period* of his residence in the Philippines. Since the petitioner claims to have been born in this country, his attesting witnesses must be persons who have known him continuously from childhood. Pedro Son’s knowledge of the petitioner was not continuous due to the gap during the war, and Epitacio Sevilla had only known the petitioner for ten years. Thus, they were not qualified to testify on his character for the required period [1].

2. **YES.** Section 7 of the Naturalization Law requires the petition to state *all* present and former places of residence, including all places where the petitioner actually and physically resided. The purpose is to enable the public and the State to gather information or objections regarding the petitioner from people in his actual physical surroundings. Petitioner’s omission of his residence in Lanao, Wilson St. in Tacloban, and Valencia in Ormoc is fatal to his application [2, 3].

**Decision reversed; application dismissed.**
