I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BANK v. JUAN GRIÑO, G.R. No. L-27205, August 15, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
C.N. Hodges (later represented by Petitioner PCIB as administrator) filed a complaint against Respondent Juan Griño to enforce a contract. The Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo declared the contract a subterfuge for a usurious loan, holding that the plaintiff could only recover the principal. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the usurious nature of the transaction but modified the judgment, ordering Griño to pay legal interest on the remaining principal of P9,002.90 from the filing of the complaint (May 22, 1956) "up to the time the same had been paid." Griño had paid the P9,002.90 principal on January 13, 1959.

After the CA decision became final, Griño tendered P1,556.27 representing the legal interest due from the filing of the complaint until the principal payment date (Jan. 13, 1959), plus taxes. PCIB refused to accept the tender and execute the conveyance of the land, arguing that under Article 1253 of the Civil Code, the payment made on Jan. 13, 1959 should have been applied first to accrued interest, leaving a balance on the principal that continued to earn interest. The CFI ruled in favor of Griño, ordering the satisfaction of judgment. PCIB appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the final judgment should be executed by applying Article 1253 of the Civil Code (applying payment to interest first) rather than the strict terms of the decision.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the CFI order. The Court reasoned that the CA decision had already become final and executory, leaving no question but its faithful execution. The final judgment explicitly obligated the respondent to pay legal interest on the P9,002.90 "up to the time the same had been paid." Since the principal was paid on January 13, 1959, the respondent's obligation was limited to the interest accrued up to that specific date. To apply Article 1253 now would vary the terms of a final judgment. The Court held that the tender of payment covering the specific period mentioned in the judgment was full satisfaction of the obligation. The Order appealed from was affirmed.
