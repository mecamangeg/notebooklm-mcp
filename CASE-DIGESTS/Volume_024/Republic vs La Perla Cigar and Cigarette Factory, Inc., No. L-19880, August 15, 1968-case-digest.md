I. CAPTION
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LA PERLA CIGAR AND CIGARETTE FACTORY, INC., G.R. No. L-19880, August 15, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
La Perla Cigar and Cigarette Factory, Inc., a domestic corporation, imported tobacco flavors for its manufacturing operations. Between 1953 and 1954, it paid P100,197.59 in special excise tax under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 601, which was later refunded upon approval of its exemption application. For imports between 1954 and 1955, the Central Bank Auditor disallowed the exemption for taxes amounting to P32,759.93. Subsequently, the Auditor General, upon review pursuant to the Revised Administrative Code, ruled the previous refund erroneous and demanded payment of both amounts. The Republic filed a suit for collection in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila. The CFI ruled in favor of the Republic, ordering La Perla to pay, primarily because La Perla failed to appeal the Auditor General's demand, even though the court noted the goods might have been exempt under the *Colgate-Palmolive* doctrine. La Perla appealed.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N tobacco flavors imported for the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes are exempt from the 17% special excise tax on foreign exchange under R.A. No. 601.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision but on the ground that the articles are not exempt by law. R.A. No. 601 imposes a 17% tax on foreign exchange but provides exemptions in Section 2, including "stabilizer and flavors." The Court held that this term does not constitute a distinct class separate from other exempted articles but refers specifically to stabilizers and flavors for *food*.

The Court observed that exempted items fall into specific categories: food, drugs/medicines, medical supplies, books, and newsprint. Legislative deliberations revealed that the exemptions were intended to benefit the masses by lowering the cost of "food, drugs, and medicine" necessary for nourishment and health. Furthermore, most other exemptions (e.g., hospital supplies, books) are subject to strict qualifications (e.g., "certified by Director of Hospitals," "approved by Board on Textbooks"). To exempt tobacco flavors without qualification would place them in a more privileged category than essential medicines and educational materials. The Court explicitly modified its previous ruling in *Colgate-Palmolive Phil., Inc. v. Jimenez* insofar as it was inconsistent with this interpretation.

The decision appealed from is affirmed.
