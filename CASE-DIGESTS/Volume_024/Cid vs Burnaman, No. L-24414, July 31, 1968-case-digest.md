I. CAPTION
DIONICIA J. CID, AMADOR JULIAN, ESCOLASTICA J. AGCAOILI, DOMINGA J. SALMO and TEODORO JULIAN v. NANCY W. BURNAMAN, ELIS J. BURNAMAN, and the COURT OF APPEALS, G.R. No. L-24414, July 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Lot No. 9008 was originally owned in undivided halves by Gregoria Bonoan (1/2) and the petitioners, surnamed Julian (1/2). Gregoria died in 1938. Her son, Cenon Bonoan (also known as Cenon Hernando), executed an affidavit adjudicating to himself Gregoria’s entire half interest as her sole heir. Cenon subsequently sold this undivided half interest to respondents Nancy and Elis Burnaman.

The petitioners filed a complaint to annul the sale regarding a one-fourth (1/4) interest, claiming that their mother, Engracia Hernando, was also a child of Gregoria. They argued that upon Gregoria's death, Cenon and Engracia should have divided the mother's half equally, entitling petitioners (as Engracia's heirs) to 1/4 of the total lot.

The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of petitioners, declaring them owners of 3/4 of the lot (their original 1/2 + the inherited 1/4) and holding that Engracia was acknowledged via her baptismal certificate. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, dismissing the complaint. It found that Engracia was an illegitimate child who was never properly acknowledged by Gregoria, and thus could not inherit.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Court of Appeals properly inquired into the filiation and status of Engracia in an ordinary civil action for annulment of sale.
2. W/N Engracia was a properly acknowledged natural child entitled to inherit from Gregoria under the Civil Code of 1889.
3. W/N the bad faith of the buyers (Burnamans) is relevant to the validity of the sale.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The inquiry was proper. Under Article 434 of the Civil Code, plaintiffs must rely on the strength of their own title, not the weakness of the defendant's claim. Since petitioners based their title on hereditary succession from Gregoria through their mother Engracia, it was necessary to determine if Engracia was actually an heir entitled to succeed.

2. **NO.** Engracia was not entitled to inherit. Under the Civil Code of 1889, in force at the time of Gregoria's death in 1938, an illegitimate child must be acknowledged to inherit. The evidence showed Engracia was a child of Gregoria with an unknown father; thus, she was illegitimate. Her baptismal certificate, merely stating she was Gregoria's child, did not constitute a sufficient act of acknowledgment because it was not executed by the parent. As held in *Canales v. Arrogante*, a parish priest cannot acknowledge in the parent's stead. Without proper acknowledgment, Engracia inherited nothing, and petitioners could not transmit any rights to the property.

3. **NO.** The question of the buyers' good or bad faith is irrelevant because the petitioners failed to establish their own title. Only a person entitled to the ownership of the disputed interest (e.g., a true heir) can raise the issue of bad faith against the buyers. Since petitioners are not heirs, they have no cause of action.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.
