I. CAPTION
**CALTEX (PHILIPPINES), INC., SHELL COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINES, LTD., STANDARD VACUUM OIL CO., petitioners, LAMBERTO SANGUILLOSA, claimant-appellee, vs. LUIS U. GO, assignee-appellant**, G.R. No. L-20831, August 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Lamberto Sanguillosa filed a claim for separation pay, underpayment of wages, and overtime against his employer, Lopez and Ledesma Transportation Co., Inc., with Regional Office No. 3 of the Department of Labor. The Regional Office rendered a decision ordering the company to pay Sanguillosa P7,274.52, which became final and executory. Subsequently, the company was declared insolvent by the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo, and Luis U. Go was appointed assignee.

In the insolvency proceedings, the CFI approved Sanguillosa’s claim as a "preferred claim" under the Insolvency Law and the Civil Code. The Assignee appealed, arguing that: (1) the Regional Office lacked jurisdiction due to improper venue as Sanguillosa was allegedly not a Manila resident; (2) the claim was not preferred because the services were not rendered "immediately" preceding the insolvency; and (3) the claim was not based on a final judgment of a regular court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the venue of the labor action was improper, thereby invalidating the claim.
2. W/N the claim for unpaid wages and benefits is a preferred credit under the Civil Code even if the services were not rendered immediately preceding the insolvency proceedings.
3. W/N the labor award qualifies as a preferred claim despite not being a judgment from a regular court.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court found that Sanguillosa was a resident of Manila at the time of filing. Moreover, the issue is purely a matter of venue, and any error committed in connection therewith, especially when raised at a late stage or for the first time on appeal, does not constitute reversible error [1]. The appellant was also deemed in estoppel for having raised the same issue in a prior dismissed civil case [2].

2. **YES.** The claim is preferred under **Article 2244, paragraph 2 of the New Civil Code**. The Court distinguished this provision from **Section 50(b) of the Insolvency Law**, which grants preference to debts for services rendered "immediately" preceding the commencement of insolvency. The Civil Code omits the adverb "immediately," stating only "for one year preceding." This omission indicates a legislative intent to broaden the law's meaning, granting preference to credits for services rendered during *any* year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings [3, 4].

3. **YES.** A claim arising from a final award enjoys preference. Relying on **Torres v. Llamas (70 Phil. 59)**, the Court held that a final award made by commissioners (or quasi-judicial bodies) is considered preferential, akin to a final judgment of a regular court [5].

**Order affirmed.**
