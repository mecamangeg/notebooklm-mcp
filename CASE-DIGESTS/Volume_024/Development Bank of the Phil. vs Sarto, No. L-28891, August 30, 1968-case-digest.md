**I. CAPTION**
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES v. THE REFEREE, ESTANISLAO D. SARTO, WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION UNIT, REGIONAL OFFICE NO. 6, and MELCHORA Z. VDA. DE BRITANICO, G.R. No. L-28891, August 30, 1968, Zaldivar, J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 5, 1957, respondent Melchora Z. Vda. de Britanico filed a claim for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA) against petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) following the death of her husband, Wilfredo V. Britanico, a records and mailing clerk at DBP [1]. Wilfredo died on October 29, 1967, due to an illness contracted in the line of duty [1].

DBP filed a motion to dismiss the claim, arguing that its employees are not covered by the WCA [1]. Respondent Referee Estanislao D. Sarto denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [1]. Consequently, DBP filed a petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court, seeking to enjoin the referee from proceeding with the claim, contending that as a government-owned corporation, it is not a "political subdivision or instrumentality" of the National Government under Section 3 of the WCA [2, 3].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N employees of the Development Bank of the Philippines are covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Court held that DBP is an instrumentality of the National Government, and thus its employees are covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act [3, 4].

Section 3 of the WCA, as amended by R.A. No. 4119, explicitly states the Act is applicable to "all officials, employees, and laborers in the service of the National Government and its political subdivisions and instrumentalities" [2]. The Court reasoned that DBP was created under Republic Act No. 2081 to promote economic development, a function the government performs through instrumentalities [3].

Furthermore, the Court distinguished that DBP exercises proprietary functions rather than sovereign power [5]. Citing *Credito Agricola de Miagao v. Monteclaro*, the Court noted that government-owned and controlled corporations like the Agricultural and Industrial Bank (DBP's predecessor) do not exercise sovereign functions [5]. Since DBP is an instrumentality exercising proprietary functions, it falls within the coverage of Section 3 of the WCA [4].

The petition for prohibition was dismissed [4].
