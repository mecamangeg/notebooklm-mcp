**I. CAPTION**
HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, INC. and VICENTE A. RUFINO v. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF THE CITY OF MANILA, ET AL., ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, Mayor of the City of Manila, G.R. No. L-23979, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 856, Concepcion, C.J.

**II. FACTS**
On December 31, 1963, the Municipal Board of the City of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 4841, which took effect on January 1, 1964 [1]. Declaring a "state of emergency" due to the scarcity of residential housing, the ordinance prohibited lessors from increasing rentals beyond specific percentages of the assessed value of the leased land or building [2], [3]. The ordinance did not contain a provision limiting its period of effectivity. Petitioners filed an action for declaratory relief in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila challenging the ordinance. The CFI rendered judgment declaring the ordinance *ultra vires*, unconstitutional, and void *ab initio* [1]. Respondent Mayor Villegas appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the validity of the ordinance and questioning the validity of the lower court proceedings because the Solicitor General was not notified as required by the Rules of Court [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N Municipal Ordinance No. 4841 is valid and constitutional.
2. W/N the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to the failure to notify the Solicitor General.

**IV. RULING**
1. **NO.** The ordinance is unconstitutional. The authority of municipal corporations to regulate is essentially police power, which is subject to the limitation that it must be reasonable [5]. When police power is exercised to restrict individual rights due to an emergency, the regulation must be "temporary" and for a "definite" period of time, reasonable in relation to the duration of the crisis [5], [6]. Ordinance No. 4841 contained no time limitation, making its effectivity "unlimited, indefinite, negative and uncertain," potentially turning a temporary measure into a permanent law [7], [8]. Citing *Rutter v. Esteban*, the Court held that emergency measures affecting property rights must be limited in time; otherwise, they are unreasonable and oppressive [6]. As the source of municipal power, the National Government's inherent limitations regarding emergency legislation also apply to municipal corporations [9].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the notification requirement under Section 4, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court is not jurisdictional [10]. Furthermore, under Section 23, Rule 3, the determination of whether to require the appearance of the Solicitor General in actions involving the validity of an ordinance is discretionary [11]. Since the appellant did not raise this issue in the lower court and the City Fiscal of Manila appeared and filed a memorandum, the validity of the proceedings was not affected [12].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**. Municipal Ordinance No. 4841 is declared unconstitutional [13].
