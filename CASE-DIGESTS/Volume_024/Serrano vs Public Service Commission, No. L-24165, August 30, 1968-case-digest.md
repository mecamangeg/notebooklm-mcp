**I. CAPTION**
JUAN M. SERRANO v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, CHAMBER OF TAXICAB SERVICES, INC., ADMIRAL TAXI Co., INC., LITA ENTERPRISES COMPANY, INC., SABINO GONZALES, ET AL., G.R. No. L-24165, August 30, 1968, Fernando, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Juan M. Serrano filed an application with the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a certificate of public convenience to operate 50 taxicab units in Manila and Luzon [1]. Serrano, an existing bus operator, presented evidence of his financial capacity and willingness to comply with regulations, while the oppositors presented no rebuttal evidence [1, 2]. The PSC subsequently issued a joint decision covering 99 applicants. It granted certificates to 60 named applicants but denied the rest, including Serrano, with a single summary statement that they were "either [dismissed] for lack of interest or failure to prosecute or [denied] for failure to qualify" [3]. The decision did not mention Serrano individually or explain the specific grounds for his denial [2]. After his motion for reconsideration was denied, Serrano filed a petition for review, arguing the PSC failed to state the facts and law as required by the Constitution [4].

**III. ISSUE/S**
W/N the Public Service Commission violated due process by summarily denying the application without stating the facts and reasons for the decision.

**IV. RULING**
**YES.** The Supreme Court ruled that while the PSC is not a "court of record" strictly bound by Article VIII, Section 12 of the Constitution to express the facts and law in its decisions [5, 6], it is a quasi-judicial tribunal that must still observe the essential requirements of due process [7, 8]. Citing *Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations* (69 Phil. 635), the Court reiterated that administrative tribunals must respect "cardinal primary rights," one of which is that the tribunal must render its decision in a manner that the parties know the issues involved and the reasons for the decision [8, 9].

The PSC's failure to refer individually to the petitioner and state why his application was denied—leaving him to guess whether it was for "lack of interest" or "failure to qualify"—constituted a violation of this right [8]. Furthermore, such arbitrary denial without a statement of facts renders the Supreme Court's power of review futile [10, 11]. The decision was set aside, and the case was remanded to the PSC to render a decision based on the evidence and facts [12].
