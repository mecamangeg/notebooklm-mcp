I. CAPTION
ADOLFO C. NAVARRO v. THE CITY OF ZAMBOANGA, G.R. No. L-24493, August 14, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
In 1930, the Municipality of Zamboanga (now City of Zamboanga) took Subdivision Lot 861-A, owned by Basilio Navarro, and converted it into a road (Buenavista St. Extension, now Gov. Alvarez Avenue). The lot was registered under the Torrens System with an Original Certificate of Title issued in 1912 to Basilio. In 1949, the title was transferred to his son, Adolfo Navarro. No annotation of any sale, donation, or right of way in favor of the government appeared on either title.

On July 13, 1950, Adolfo Navarro filed an action to recover the value of the lot and rentals. The City argued that Basilio had donated the property and that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, relying on hearsay regarding a 1932 conference and the presumption of regularity. The Court of First Instance of Zamboanga ruled in favor of Navarro, ordering the City to pay the value of the lot but not the rentals. The City appealed to the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lot was validly donated to the City.
2. W/N the action to recover the value of the lot is barred by the statute of limitations.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The City failed to prove the alleged donation. Its evidence, consisting of letters expressing beliefs that owners "must have" donated the land, was hearsay. Furthermore, no annotation of any donation or right of way appeared on the Torrens title. Had a valid donation or grant existed, it would have been set forth in a public document and registered. The lack of such registration offsets the presumption of regularity in the government's road construction [1].

2. **NO.** The defense of prescription is manifestly untenable because the property is registered under the Torrens System. Registered land is not subject to prescription. The Court cited established jurisprudence, specifically *Alfonso v. Pasay City*, *Herrera v. Auditor General*, and *Lopez v. Auditor General*, to support the principle that an action to recover compensation for registered land taken for public use does not prescribe [2, 3].

The decision appealed from is **AFFIRMED**.
