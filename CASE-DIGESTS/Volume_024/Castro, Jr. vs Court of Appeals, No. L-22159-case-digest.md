I. CAPTION
EMILIANO CASTRO, JR. v. COURT OF APPEALS and PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, G.R. No. L-22159, July 31, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Emiliano Castro, Jr. was legally married to the complainant in 1952, though they separated in 1954 [1]. From 1956 to 1959, Castro cohabited with his co-defendant, Lolita Flojo, at his former matrimonial domicile in Manila [1]. Evidence presented included a birth certificate for a child born to Lolita in 1957, where she used the surname "Castro," listed Emiliano as the father, and used his address [1]. Additionally, in her SSS form, Lolita listed Emiliano as her "husband" [1].

Castro was charged and convicted of concubinage. He appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), claiming his wife had condoned or pardoned his acts, but the CA affirmed the conviction [2, 3]. Castro then filed a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme Court, raising issues regarding the factual findings and the alleged condonation [4, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals regarding the illicit relations are reviewable by the Supreme Court.
2. W/N there was condonation or pardon on the part of the complainant wife.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are conclusive upon the Supreme Court in a petition for review on certiorari [5]. The Court noted that the issues raised were basically factual and devoid of merit [5]. The prosecution's evidence, including the complainant's testimony corroborated by the birth certificate and SSS documents, sufficiently established the illicit relations [1, 5].

2. **NO.** The Court ruled that there was no condonation. The conclusion of the CA that no pardon existed is a finding of fact not reviewable by the Supreme Court [3]. Furthermore, the complainant's behavior showed she never consented to or pardoned the acts: in 1957 she referred to the co-defendant as a "querida" (mistress) in letters, and in 1959 she filed a civil action for legal separation based on the illicit relations [3, 6].

The decision appealed from is affirmed [6].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred [7].
