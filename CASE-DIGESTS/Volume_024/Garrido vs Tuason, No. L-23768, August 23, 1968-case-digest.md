I. CAPTION
**JOSE GARRIDO v. PILAR G. TUASON**, G.R. No. L-23768, August 23, 1968, 24 SCRA 727, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Jose Garrido filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 71763) in the Municipal Court of Manila to foreclose a chattel mortgage executed by Pilar Tuason securing a P1,000 debt. The court rendered a decision ordering Tuason to pay the principal, interest, and costs, but did not specifically order the foreclosure/sale of the property. A writ of execution was issued, and Tuason's car was sold at auction for P550.

Garrido then filed a motion for an *alias* writ of execution to recover the deficiency balance of P1,290.58. The Municipal Court denied this motion. Instead of appealing the denial, Garrido filed a new action (Civil Case No. 76462) for the deficiency. The Municipal Court dismissed this new case, and on appeal, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Manila also dismissed it. The CFI reasoned that under Article 2115 of the Civil Code (governing Pledge), which applies to Chattel Mortgage via Article 2141, the creditor is not entitled to recover any deficiency after the sale of the thing pledged. Garrido appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Article 2115 of the Civil Code, which bars recovery of deficiency in pledge, applies to chattel mortgages.
2. W/N the dismissal of the second action for deficiency was proper.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Court ruled that Article 2115 of the Civil Code is inconsistent with the Chattel Mortgage Law and therefore does not apply. Under Section 14 of Act No. 1508 (Chattel Mortgage Law), the proceeds of the sale are applied to the obligation, and contrary to the rule in pledge, a chattel mortgage creditor may maintain an action for the deficiency judgment (*Bank of P.I. v. Olutanga Lumber Co.*; *Ablaza v. Ignacio*). The CFI erred in applying Article 2115 to bar the claim.

2. **YES.** Despite the CFI's erroneous reliance on Article 2115, the dismissal of the case is affirmed on the ground of *res judicata*. The Supreme Court noted that the original decision in Civil Case No. 71763 was an ordinary money judgment, not a true foreclosure judgment, as it did not order the sale of the mortgaged property to satisfy the debt. Consequently, when the Municipal Court denied Garrido's motion for an *alias* writ of execution to cover the deficiency, Garrido should have appealed that order. Because he failed to appeal, the order became final, barring the institution of a subsequent case for the same claim.

**Decision affirmed.**
