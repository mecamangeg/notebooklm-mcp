I. CAPTION
PLARIDEL SURETY & INSURANCE COMPANY v. HON. W. DE LOS ANGELES, SIMEON BIGLANG-AWA, TOMAS GALVEZ, and CITY SHERIFF OF QUEZON CITY, G.R. No. L-25550, July 31, 1968, 24 SCRA 487, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
On July 9, 1954, Tomas Galvez filed a replevin case for nine carabaos against Simeon Biglang-awa. Petitioner Plaridel Surety posted the replevin bond for Galvez. The municipal court ruled in favor of Galvez, but the Court of First Instance (CFI) reversed this on appeal, declaring Biglang-awa the owner. The Court of Appeals affirmed the CFI decision on April 24, 1964.

Almost a year after the CA decision, on March 1, 1965, Biglang-awa filed a motion with the CFI for execution against the replevin bond. Judge De los Angeles granted the motion and ordered P550.00 deducted from the bond. Plaridel Surety moved to quash, arguing that under Section 10, Rule 60, there was no timely application for damages. The Judge denied the motion. Plaridel filed a petition for certiorari.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the surety may be held liable on the replevin bond when the application for damages was filed after the judgment had become final.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court ruled that the surety cannot be held liable. Under Section 10, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, the procedure for enforcing a surety's liability is governed by Section 20, Rule 57. This rule explicitly requires that damages against the bond "may be awarded only upon application and after proper hearing and **shall be included in the final judgment**."

The Court reiterated the requisites for recovery on a replevin bond set in *People's Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. v. Aragon*: (1) an application showing the right to damages; (2) notice to the plaintiff and surety; (3) a hearing; and (4) the award must be included in the judgment. The application must be filed before trial, before appeal is perfected, or before the judgment becomes executory. In this case, the claim was made almost a year after the judgment became final. A notification to the surety after the judgment does not cure the failure to include the claim in the judgment itself.

Petition granted; the questioned orders are revoked.
