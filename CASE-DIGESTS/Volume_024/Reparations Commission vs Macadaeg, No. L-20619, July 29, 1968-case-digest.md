I. CAPTION
REPARATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL. v. HON. JUDGE HIGINIO B. MACADAEG, ET AL., G.R. No. L-20619, July 29, 1968, 24 SCRA 299, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
The Reparations Commission (Commission) awarded Liberation Steamship Co. (Liberation) two ocean-going vessels. Liberation filed a mandamus suit to compel the implementation of this award. The parties executed a Compromise Agreement, approved by the CFI on November 10, 1960, wherein the Commission agreed to "consider" Liberation's willingness to be included in the "next available yearly schedule," expressly subject to availability of funds and approval by the National Economic Council and the Japanese Government (GAIMUSHO).

In 1961, Liberation moved for execution. Respondent Judge Macadaeg granted the motion and issued a writ ordering the Commission to include Liberation in the *1961* reparations schedule. The Commission attempted to appeal the order, but Judge Macadaeg dismissed the appeal on the ground that a judgment based on a compromise is final and executory. The Commission filed a petition for mandamus in the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and subsequently filed the present petition in the Supreme Court.

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the petition for mandamus was filed within a reasonable time.
2. W/N the writ of execution issued by the lower court was valid.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** Section 15, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court fixes no specific period for filing a petition for mandamus to compel a court to give due course to an appeal. The time for filing is deemed "variable as the ends of justice may demand" (*Centenera v. Yatco*). The Commission filed the petition within a reasonable time, acting immediately after the Court of Appeals dismissed their previous petition on jurisdictional grounds. This ruling supersedes the view in *Cortes v. CFI* regarding filing "at the next term" of the appellate court.

2. **NO.** Treating the petition as one for certiorari to avoid delay, the Supreme Court ruled that the writ of execution was void because it varied the terms of the judgment. The Compromise Agreement only obligated the Commission to *consider* Liberation for the *next available* schedule subject to complex factors beyond its control (e.g., NEC priorities, GAIMUSHO approval). It did not mandate inclusion in the specific *1961* schedule. An order of execution cannot modify the judgment it seeks to enforce, nor can it control the discretionary judgment of the Commission.

The order and writ of execution are declared null and void *ab initio*, and the preliminary injunction is made permanent.

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes (J.B.L.), Dizon, Makalintal, Sanchez, Castro, and Angeles concurred. Justice Zaldivar took no part.
