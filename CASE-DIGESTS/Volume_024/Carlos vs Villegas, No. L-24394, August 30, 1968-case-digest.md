I. CAPTION
JUANITO CARLOS v. ANTONIO J. VILLEGAS, et al., G.R. No. L-24394, August 30, 1968, 24 SCRA 831, Angeles, J.

II. FACTS
Petitioner Juanito Carlos and other members of the Uniformed Force Division of the Manila Fire Department (MFD) filed a petition for mandamus against the Mayor, Fire Chief, and Treasurer of Manila [1]. They sought to compel the City to pay them overtime pay for services rendered from January 1, 1962, to January 4, 1963, and to enforce the 40-Hour Week Work Law (Republic Act No. 1880) [2].

The petitioners worked on a schedule of 24 hours on duty followed by 24 hours off, averaging 84 hours of work per week [3]. While on duty, they maintained the station and equipment and responded to fire alarms; they were allowed to rest or sleep during specific hours when not fighting fires [3]. The respondents refused the claims, citing an opinion from the Secretary of Justice that service beyond the fixed period did not entitle them to overtime pay as a matter of legal right [4]. The Court of First Instance of Manila dismissed the petition [2, 5].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petitioners (firemen) are entitled to overtime pay and the coverage of the 40-Hour Week Work Law (R.A. 1880).

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Court affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that firemen are not entitled to overtime pay or the benefits of the 40-Hour Week Work Law [6, 7].

The Court held that the petitioners are civil service employees of the City of Manila employed in a governmental capacity [8]. As such, they are governed by Sections 566 and 259 of the Revised Administrative Code, not by the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444) [9, 10]. Citing *Namarco v. Prisco Workers Union*, the Court reiterated that C.A. 444 does not apply to civil service employees governed by the Revised Administrative Code [9, 11]. Section 566 allows heads of offices to extend daily hours of labor when public service requires it, and Section 259 inhibits the payment of extra compensation in the absence of special provision [12, 13].

Furthermore, the nature of a fireman's duty requires round-the-clock observance to respond to exigencies [14, 15]. This "exigency of the service" specifically excepts them from the application of Section 562 of the Revised Administrative Code as amended by R.A. 1880 (The 40-Hour Week Work Law), which contains a proviso excluding situations "where the exigencies of service so require" [15].

The petition was denied, and the decision appealed from was affirmed [7].
