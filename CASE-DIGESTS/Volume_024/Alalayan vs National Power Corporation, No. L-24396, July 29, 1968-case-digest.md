I. CAPTION
SANTIAGO P. ALALAYAN, ET AL. v. NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION and ADMINISTRATOR OF ECONOMIC COORDINATION, G.R. No. L-24396, July 29, 1968, Fernando, J. [1-3]

II. FACTS
Petitioner Santiago P. Alalayan, a franchise holder of an electric plant, filed a petition for declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of Section 3 of Republic Act No. 3043 [3, 4]. This provision amended Commonwealth Act No. 120 and authorized the respondent National Power Corporation (NPC) to require, as a condition in contracts with franchise holders receiving at least 50% of their power from NPC, that said holders "shall not realize a net profit of more than twelve percent annually of its investments plus two-month operating expenses" [3]. The law also allowed NPC to renew existing contracts to give effect to this provision [3].

Alalayan argued that the provision was a "rider" violative of the constitutional rule that a bill must embrace only one subject expressed in its title [5]. He further contended that the law violated the due process clause by infringing on the liberty to contract and that the 12% profit cap was confiscatory [5, 6]. Finally, he claimed the application of the law to existing contracts violated the non-impairment clause [7]. The Court of First Instance of Manila upheld the validity of the statute and denied the petition [8].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N Section 3 of R.A. No. 3043 is unconstitutional for being a "rider" that violates the requirement that a bill shall embrace only one subject expressed in its title.
2. W/N the provision violates the due process clause by arbitrarily restricting the liberty to contract and imposing a confiscatory profit limit.
3. W/N the application of the provision to existing contracts constitutes an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contracts.

IV. RULING
1. **NO**. The Court held that the constitutional provision is not violated where the title is comprehensive enough reasonably to include the general object which the statute seeks to effect [9]. R.A. No. 3043 amends an existing law, and it suffices if reference is made to the legislation to be amended without stating the precise nature of the amendment [9]. The provision limiting profits is germane to the subject matter of the bill [10, 11].

2. **NO**. The liberty to contract, particularly regarding business activities, may be subjected to restrictions under the police power for the interest of the general welfare [12]. The Court cited *Calalang v. Williams*, stating that public welfare lies at the bottom of the enactment and that persons and property may be subjected to restraints to secure the general prosperity of the state [12, 13]. Regarding the 12% profit limit, the Court ruled it was not confiscatory, citing *Manila Electric Co. v. Public Service Commission* where such a figure was upheld, and noting the absence of evidence demonstrating a confiscatory effect [6].

3. **NO**. Statutes enacted for the regulation of public utilities are a proper exercise of police power and are applicable to contracts already in existence [7]. Citing *Pangasinan Transportation Co. v. Public Service Commission*, the Court reasoned that the constitutional guarantee of non-impairment is limited by the police power [7, 14]. A balancing process is required, and in this case, the remedial nature of the statute justifies its application to existing conditions [15, 16].

The decision of the lower court is affirmed [17].
