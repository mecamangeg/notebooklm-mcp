I. CAPTION
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES v. ROMEO DORIQUEZ, G.R. Nos. L-24444-45, July 29, 1968, Castro, J.

II. FACTS
On August 28, 1964, Romeo Doriquez was charged with Grave Oral Defamation in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Iloilo for allegedly insulting Atty. Sixto Demaisip on April 22, 1964 [1]. Subsequently, on September 3, 1964, he was charged in the same court with Discharge of Firearm for allegedly firing a revolver at the same lawyer on the same date [2].

Doriquez moved to dismiss both informations. He argued that: (1) the CFI lacked jurisdiction over Grave Oral Defamation, claiming that R.A. 3828 expanded the exclusive jurisdiction of municipal courts to include this offense; and (2) the charge for Discharge of Firearm placed him in double jeopardy because a previous complaint for "Alarm and Scandal" based on the same facts had been dismissed by the Municipal Court of Batad without his consent [3]. The CFI denied the motion to dismiss and the subsequent motion for reconsideration [4]. Doriquez filed an appeal to the Supreme Court [4].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the appeal from the order denying the motion to dismiss is proper.
2. W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the offense of Grave Oral Defamation.
3. W/N the prosecution for Discharge of Firearm constitutes double jeopardy given the previous dismissal of Alarm and Scandal.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The appeal is premature because an order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory, meaning it does not finally dispose of the action [5]. Interlocutory orders cannot be appealed until final judgment is rendered [4]. However, because all cogent issues were before the Court, it treated the appeal as a petition for *certiorari* to definitively resolve the legal questions [6].

2. **YES.** The offense falls within the concurrent jurisdiction of the CFI and the Municipal Courts. While R.A. 3828 expanded the jurisdiction of municipal courts, it did not repeal the jurisdiction of the CFI under Section 44(f) of the Judiciary Act [7]. There exists a zone of concurrent jurisdiction for offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than 6 months but not exceeding 3 years [8]. Grave Oral Defamation, punishable by *prision correccional* in its minimum period (incarceration not exceeding 2 years and 4 months), falls within this concurrent zone [9].

3. **NO.** The plea of double jeopardy is untenable because there is no "identity of offenses" [10]. Although the two charges may have arisen from the same act (firing a revolver), Alarm and Scandal is an offense against public order, while Discharge of Firearm is a crime against persons [11]. They are distinct felonies in law with diverse indispensable elements [12], [13]. Double jeopardy only applies when the offenses are identical or when one includes the other [10].

ACCORDINGLY, the present appeal is dismissed. This case is hereby ordered remanded to the court of origin for immediate trial on the merits [14].
