I. CAPTION
JUANITA RIVERA v. SILVINO CURAMEN, G.R. No. L-23245, July 31, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Silvino Curamen and his wife, Dominga Barcelona, were holders of a Free Patent and a Homestead Title over parcels of land in Nueva Ecija. In 1950, they mortgaged these lands to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC). Upon default, RFC foreclosed the mortgage and acquired the properties as the highest bidder in 1955. On April 1, 1955, the Curamen spouses sold their "right to repurchase" the properties to Petitioner Juanita Rivera and her husband for P4,000.00, on the condition that the Riveras would continue paying the mortgage to RFC.

Later, Silvino Curamen offered to repurchase the properties from the Riveras, but they refused. Silvino filed an action for reconveyance. During the pendency of the case, Silvino died and was substituted by his daughters, Justina and Felicidad. The Riveras argued that they had acquired full rights, presenting a quit-claim deed executed in 1958 by Silvino's widow, Dominga, ceding her rights to them. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision ordering the Riveras to reconvey the properties to the Curamen heirs.

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the legal heirs of the patentee retain the right to repurchase the homestead property under the Public Land Act despite the patentee's sale of his right to repurchase and the widow's execution of a quit-claim.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court affirmed the decision with modification. Under the Public Land Act, every conveyance of land acquired under free patent or homestead provisions is subject to repurchase by the applicant, his widow, *or legal heirs* within five years from the conveyance.

The Court held that even assuming the original grantees (Silvino and Dominga) had lost their personal rights to repurchase due to the 1955 sale and the 1958 quit-claim, respectively, it does not follow that their legal heirs lost their right. The law grants the legal heirs the right to repurchase the *property*—meaning the whole of it, not just their hereditary share—independently of the parents' acts. The law intends to enable the family to preserve the homestead and must be liberally construed to effectuate that purpose (citing *Lustado v. Piñol*). The quit-claim executed by the widow binds her alone and cannot deprive her children of their statutory right to repurchase.

The decision was **MODIFIED** to state that if the petitioners have not yet repurchased the properties from the RFC, they are ordered to reconvey to the respondents the *right to repurchase* said properties; if they have already repurchased them, they must reconvey the properties upon payment of the redemption price.
