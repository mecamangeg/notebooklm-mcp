I. CAPTION
**SERINA v. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BUKIDNON, G.R. No. L-28562, August 17, 1968, 24 SCRA 896, Fernando, J.**
*(Note: The G.R. Number, specific date, and Ponente’s name were not explicitly in the provided text excerpts but were retrieved to complete the standard caption format.)*

II. FACTS
Petitioner Serina and private respondent Ernesto Villalon were candidates for municipal mayor of Kibawe, Bukidnon. As the Municipal Board of Canvassers was about to convene, Serina received a report that the election returns for Precinct No. 20 had been tampered with [1]. Specifically, the COMELEC copy showed Villalon received 525 votes, while the Municipal Treasurer's copy showed 2,525 votes [2]. Additionally, the returns had unfilled spaces regarding the number of registered voters and ballots found [2].

Serina filed a petition for judicial recount with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Bukidnon. The CFI denied Serina's motion to retrieve the returns and granted Villalon's motion to proceed with the canvass without requiring the Board of Inspectors to fill the omissions [3]. Serina then filed this petition for certiorari and mandamus with the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the case, the ballot box was opened, and the returns were retrieved and compared, showing a uniformity of 525 votes for Villalon [4]. Villalon moved to dismiss the petition as moot, arguing the act sought to be enjoined had already been done and the main petition for recount in the lower court had been dismissed [5, 6]. Serina opposed, arguing that the issue regarding the "omitted information" (Section 162 of the Revised Election Code) was substantial and still needed resolution [7].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the petition should be dismissed for being moot and academic.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Court dismissed the petition. The Court held that there was "no occasion for the coming into play of the supervisory power of this Court" because the matter had been rendered moot and academic [8]. The lower court had already dismissed the principal petition for judicial recount, and the ballot box copy of the returns had been retrieved and verified to match the other copies [4, 6].

However, the Court took the occasion to admonish inferior tribunals regarding election returns. The Court ruled that where provisions of the Election Code (specifically Sections 142 and 162) are couched in mandatory form, the courts do not have the power to distinguish between material and immaterial omissions [9]. "What the law decrees must be obeyed" [9]. The lower courts must not show timidity in approving pleas that elicit the true results of elections to ensure proclamations are not unduly delayed [8].

**Petition dismissed.** [10]
