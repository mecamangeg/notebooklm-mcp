I. CAPTION
PHILIPPINE ASSOCIATION OF FREE LABOR UNIONS (PAFLU) v. HON. EMILIANO C. TABIGNE, Adm. Case No. 102, July 15, 1968, Dizon, J.

II. FACTS
On May 31, 1966, complainant PAFLU filed administrative charges for serious misconduct and inefficiency against respondent Judge Emiliano C. Tabigne of the Court of Industrial Relations [1]. The Supreme Court referred the case to Justice Angel H. Mojica of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report, and recommendation [1].

The charges stemmed from respondent's actuations in various cases, including *Luzon Tinsmith Co. v. PAFLU*, *Goya Products Co. v. PAFLU*, and a certification election at Shell Refinery. PAFLU alleged that respondent issued writs without basis, caused undue delays, and employed means to retaliate against and persecute the union [2]. Justice Mojica heard the evidence from both parties and submitted a report recommending exoneration [2, 3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N Judge Tabigne is guilty of serious misconduct and inefficiency.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The Supreme Court approved the investigator's recommendation, finding the conclusions fully justified by the evidence [3].

The Court held that the charges were not substantiated. Specifically:
1.  In *Luzon Tinsmith*, the charges were not supported by clear evidence [2].
2.  In *Goya Products*, the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction *ex-parte* was a sound exercise of judicial discretion to prevent untoward incidents in the strike area [2].
3.  In the *Shell Refinery* case, allegations of delay were unfounded [2].
4.  There was no evidence that respondent retaliated against the complainant; he satisfactorily explained his orders and dissents [2].
5.  Allegations regarding delays in the supplemental complaint were disproven, as the records showed motions were resolved promptly within 2 to 12 days [2].

Consequently, the respondent was **EXONERATED** from the charges [3].
