I. CAPTION
ANDRES LAPITAN v. SCANDIA, INC., and GENERAL ENGINEERING CO., G.R. No. L-24668, July 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
On April 17, 1963, Andres Lapitan purchased a 16 HP ABC Diesel Engine from Scandia, Inc. through its subdealer General Engineering Co. for P3,735.00 to run his rice and corn mill in Ormoc City [1]. The defendants warranted that spare parts were available and that they would replace broken parts within 12 months. On June 28, 1963, the cam rocker arm broke due to faulty material. A replacement was sent on August 29, 1963, but it also broke six days later [1].

Lapitan demanded the rescission of the sale and the return of the price, but the defendants refused. He subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cebu praying for rescission, reimbursement of the P3,735.00 price, P4,000.00 in actual damages, P1,000.00 in attorney's fees, and moral/exemplary damages [1]. Scandia, Inc. moved to dismiss, arguing that the total claim of P8,735.00 was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Municipal Court (limit of P10,000.00 under R.A. 3828) [2]. The CFI dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. Lapitan appealed directly to the Supreme Court [3].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over an action for rescission of contract where the accompanying claim for damages falls within the jurisdictional amount of the Municipal Court.

IV. RULING
**YES.** The Supreme Court reversed the order of dismissal. The Court held that the subject matter of actions for rescission of contracts is not capable of pecuniary estimation, and therefore falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of First Instance (now Regional Trial Courts) [4].

In determining jurisdiction, the criterion is the nature of the principal action. If the action is primarily for the recovery of a sum of money, it is capable of pecuniary estimation, and jurisdiction depends on the amount claimed [3]. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money—such as suits for specific performance, support, or rescission—the subject of litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation [3]. Rescission is the counterpart of specific performance; both require the court to undertake an investigation into facts justifying the setting aside or enforcement of a contract [5]. The prayer for damages is merely incidental to or a consequence of the principal relief of rescission [3]. The Court ruled that the lower court erred in declining jurisdiction.

The appealed order of dismissal was reversed and set aside, and the case was remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings [4].
