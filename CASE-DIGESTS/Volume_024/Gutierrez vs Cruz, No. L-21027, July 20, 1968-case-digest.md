I. CAPTION
TESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED TEODORO T. CRUZ. JUAN GUTIERREZ, ET AL. v. LUCIANO T. CRUZ, ET AL., G.R. No. L-21027, July 20, 1968, Makalintal, J.

II. FACTS
On November 5, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan admitted the will of Teodoro T. Cruz to probate and ordered the summary settlement of his estate, valued at approximately P4,970.00, in accordance with the will [1, 2]. Petitioners-appellees (Gutierrez et al.) moved for reconsideration, arguing that the properties were conjugal and the will’s dispositions under the Old Civil Code should be adjusted to the New Civil Code [3, 4]. The trial court denied this motion on February 17, 1959, ruling that the will did not impair the heirs' legitimes [5]. Petitioners did not appeal this order, and it became final [6].

Subsequently, the heirs accepted their shares; some took possession, transferred titles, or sold their portions [7]. Months later, petitioners filed a new petition for the appointment of an administrator and a new partition, alleging that three parcels of land (Taroy, Barao, and Kiskisan) were omitted from the will [6, 8]. The trial court granted the petition, appointed an administrator, and eventually approved a new project of partition on October 31, 1962, despite the opposition of appellants (Luciano Cruz et al.) who argued that the estate had already been summarily settled [9, 10].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the lower court could validly approve a new project of partition after the order of summary settlement had become final and the heirs had accepted their shares.
2. W/N the court could partition the additional properties (Taroy, Barao, Kiskisan) allegedly belonging to the estate but claimed exclusively by the appellants.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** The Supreme Court held that the summary settlement of the estate was an adjudicated matter that had become final and executory. The trial court's order on February 17, 1959, declaring the will's dispositions in accordance with law, was never appealed [11]. Furthermore, the summary settlement complied with the procedural requisites of Section 2, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court [11]. Most importantly, the heirs had already accepted and disposed of their shares. Under Article 1056 of the Civil Code, "the acceptance of an inheritance, once made, is irrevocable and cannot be impugned, except when it was made through any of the causes that vitiate consent or when an unknown will appears" [7]. Therefore, a new project of partition was no longer legally feasible [12].

2. **NO.** Regarding the properties locally called *Taroy, Barao,* and *Kiskisan* which were not mentioned in the will, there were conflicting claims of ownership between the petitioners (who claimed they belonged to the estate) and the appellants (who claimed exclusive ownership) [12]. The Court ruled that where there are conflicting claims on property included in the estate, the question of ownership must first be ventilated in an appropriate proceeding; hence, partition is not yet in order [12, 13].

The order approving the project of partition was set aside [14].
