I. CAPTION
PERFECTO CORDERO, et al. v. THE HONORABLE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS and JESUS F. CASTRO, G.R. No. L-25729, August 14, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
Petitioners were share tenants of respondent Jesus Castro in Plaridel, Bulacan. On April 25, 1964, they entered into agricultural leasehold contracts (*Kasunduan*) with Castro [1, 2]. Paragraph 6 of these contracts stipulated that the petitioners must use the respondent lessor's threshing machine (*tiliadora*) for their palay harvest, paying a fee of 6 sacks to the lessor for every 120 sacks threshed [1, 2]. In February 1965, petitioners utilized a threshing machine belonging to a third party [1]. Respondent Castro subsequently filed a case in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) for ejectment and damages, alleging a violation of the contract [1, 3]. The CAR ruled that the stipulation was valid because the contract was entered into voluntarily with the assistance of counsel, though it did not order ejectment for this first offense [4, 5]. Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the provision was contrary to law [4].

III. ISSUE/S
W/N the stipulation in an agricultural leasehold contract requiring the lessee to rent the lessor's threshing machine is valid.

IV. RULING
**NO.** The stipulation is void. The Supreme Court held that the provision violates Section 15(3) of Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code), which states that a term in a leasehold contract is contrary to law, morals, or public policy if "the agricultural lessee is required... to hire farm implements from the agricultural lessor" as a condition of the contract [6, 7]. Although the lower court emphasized the voluntariness of the agreement, the Supreme Court ruled that the statute deems such stipulations as "imposed" conditions [8]. The fact that the respondent sued for ejectment and damages upon the violation of this clause proved that he regarded the obligation as a prerequisite for his consent to the contract, thereby contravening the spirit and letter of the law [8, 9].
The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is REVERSED, and the writ of preliminary injunction is made permanent [10].
