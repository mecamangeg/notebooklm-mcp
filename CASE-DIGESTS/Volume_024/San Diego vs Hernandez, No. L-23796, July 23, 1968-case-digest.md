I. CAPTION
LOURDES P. SAN DIEGO and BENJAMIN M. GRECIA v. THE HON. FERNANDO HERNANDEZ, HON. JOSE RODRIGUEZ, HON. ANTONIO CAÑIZARES, MODESTO A. OBISPO and CIPRIANO VALERIANO, G.R. No. L-23796, July 23, 1968, Concepcion, C.J.

II. FACTS
On October 3, 1964, Manuel Abella was mauled in Quezon City. Petitioner Assistant City Fiscal Grecia filed an information for frustrated murder in the CFI of Quezon City (presided by Petitioner Judge San Diego) against several individuals and "John Doe" and "Richard Doe" [1]. Respondents Modesto Obispo (an Assistant City Fiscal) and Cipriano Valeriano (a policeman) were implicated but not initially named. The Secretary of Justice designated State Prosecutor Villa to assist the investigation [2, 3].

During the arraignment of the other accused on October 19, 1964, Judge San Diego allowed Fiscal Grecia to amend the information by substituting "John Doe" and "Richard Doe" with the names of Obispo and Valeriano [4]. Respondents moved to quash the information due to the lack of a preliminary investigation, which the trial court denied [5]. Respondents then filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals, which issued a preliminary injunction restraining the trial [6]. Petitioners filed this action to annul the CA's order [7].

III. ISSUE/S
1. W/N the Assistant City Fiscal lost the authority to prosecute the case upon the designation of a State Prosecutor.
2. W/N the respondents were entitled to a preliminary investigation prior to their inclusion in the amended information.

IV. RULING
1. **NO.** Under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1198, State Attorneys are authorized to "assist or collaborate" with the Fiscal unless the Secretary of Justice expressly directs otherwise [8, 9]. The designation of the State Prosecutor in this case was specifically to *assist* the City Fiscal; therefore, the City Fiscal and Petitioner Grecia retained control over the prosecution and the authority to amend the information [10].

2. **NO.** The right to a preliminary investigation is not a constitutional right but exists only when created by statute [11-13]. Section 38 of the Revised Charter of Quezon City (R.A. 537) expressly provides that a defendant in a case triable only in the CFI shall **not** be entitled to a preliminary investigation as a matter of right if the City Fiscal, after due investigation, has filed a proper information [11-13]. Since the Fiscal had conducted an investigation and merely inserted the true names of the accused previously identified as "Does," there was no denial of due process [14].

The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court of Appeals is **ANNULLED** [15].

V. CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINIONS
Justices Reyes, J.B.L., Dizon, Makalintal, Zaldivar, Sanchez, Castro, Angeles, and Fernando concurred with the ruling [15].
