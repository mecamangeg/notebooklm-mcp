**I. CAPTION**
**JOSE TUBURAN v. FRANK BALLENER and THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS**, G.R. No. L-28751, August 30, 1968, Makalintal, J.

**II. FACTS**
Petitioner Jose Tuburan and respondent Frank Ballener were candidates for Mayor in President Roxas, Cotabato. During the canvassing, Tuburan objected to the election return from Precinct 18, alleging it was tampered with to show he received zero or one vote instead of sixty-four (64). The objection was disregarded, and Ballener was proclaimed winner on December 13, 1967. On December 21, Tuburan sent a petition to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to annul the proclamation, but due to travel difficulties, it was not actually filed until December 26.

Unsure if his COMELEC petition had been filed and fearing the expiration of the period to file an election protest (December 27), Tuburan filed an election protest *ad cautelam* with the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cotabato on the afternoon of December 26. On December 28, the COMELEC heard the petition, found strong evidence of falsification, annulled Ballener's proclamation, and ordered a recanvass. Tuburan was subsequently proclaimed and assumed office.

However, Ballener filed a Motion for Reconsideration on January 31, 1968, arguing that the COMELEC lost jurisdiction when Tuburan filed the election protest in the CFI. The COMELEC granted the motion, citing the general rule that filing a court protest abandons the administrative remedy. Tuburan filed this petition for certiorari.

**III. ISSUE/S**
1. W/N the COMELEC retained jurisdiction to entertain the petition for annulment of proclamation despite the subsequent filing of an election protest in the CFI.
2. W/N Ballener's Motion for Reconsideration was filed within the reglementary period.

**IV. RULING**
1. **YES.** While the general rule is that the filing of an election protest in the CFI divests the COMELEC of jurisdiction (as held in *Reyes v. Reyes*), the peculiar circumstances of this case justify an exception. Tuburan filed the CFI protest merely as a precautionary measure (*ad cautelam*) to protect his rights because the deadline was imminent and he lacked knowledge of whether his COMELEC petition had been received due to communication difficulties. Unlike in *Reyes*, there was no deliberate intent to abandon the COMELEC proceedings. Furthermore, the evidence of falsification was strong, and annulling Tuburan's proclamation would unjustly entrench the respondent whose right rested on a falsified return [1], [2], [3].

2. **NO.** Ballener filed his Motion for Reconsideration on January 31, 1968, which was thirty-four (34) days after the December 28 resolution, well beyond the ten-day reglementary period. His claim of defective notice (via telegram) was negated by his subsequent actions: he was represented by counsel during the recanvass on December 31 and filed his own election protest on January 13, indicating he had recognized and accepted the COMELEC's resolution [4], [5].

The petition is **GRANTED**, and the COMELEC resolution annulling Tuburan’s proclamation is set aside [6].
