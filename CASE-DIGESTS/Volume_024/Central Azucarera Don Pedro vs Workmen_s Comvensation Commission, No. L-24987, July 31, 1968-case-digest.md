I. CAPTION
CENTRAL AZUCARERA DON PEDRO v. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION and PEDRO VILLANUEVA, G.R. No. L-24987, July 31, 1968, Reyes, J.B.L., J.

II. FACTS
Respondent Pedro Villanueva worked for petitioner Central Azucarera Don Pedro starting in 1933, eventually rising to the position of "cabo palero" in 1946 [1]. His duties involved supervising furnaces and cleaning equipment, requiring him to work rotating shifts (including late nights) and breathe hot, dust-laden air [2]. He stopped working in July 1961 due to fever, chest pains, and coughing [1]. While previous annual exams were clear, X-rays taken in September and December 1961 confirmed he had minimal pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. The Workmen's Compensation Commission (WCC) awarded him compensation [3]. Petitioner appealed, arguing that the evidence did not prove the ailment was work-related and that the claim was filed beyond the period fixed by the Compensation Act [4].

III. ISSUES
1. W/N the claimant's illness (pulmonary tuberculosis) is compensable.
2. W/N the claim is barred by the delay in filing.

IV. RULING
1. **YES.** The Court ruled that the illness is compensable. The specific conditions of Villanueva's work—repeated night shifts and exposure to hot, dust-laden air—debilitated his body resistance and facilitated the activation of dormant tuberculosis [5, 6]. Additionally, Section 44, No. 1 of Act 3428 creates a statutory presumption of compensability, shifting the burden to the employer to prove the illness was not caused or aggravated by the nature of the employment, which the petitioner failed to rebut [4, 7].

2. **NO.** The Court held that the delay in filing is not fatal to the claim. The trend in jurisprudence is to treat delay as a non-jurisdictional defect unless the employer demonstrates it was prejudiced thereby [8-10]. This supports the Civil Code's mandate under Article 24 for courts to be vigilant in protecting workmen who are often at a disadvantage [10, 11].

Decision affirmed [12].
